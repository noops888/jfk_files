SUBJECT

SA/D0/0

The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence

by victor Marchetti and John D. Märks

1.

Subject book was published in 1974 with 168

deleted items demanded by CIA and involved court

trial and decision.

The lawyer for the authors has,

in effect, requested that a review be made of the

168 deleted items to determine which can now be

declassified and removed from the court's injunction,

particularly in view of the official disclosures

since the publication of the book.

The Department of

Justice has advised that such a review is in order.

2.

Since the courts

decided the 168 deleted

items were properly classifiable and classified in

effect at the time of the initial classification,

time must include two points:

Is the item still classified under

Executive Order 11652,

Has the item been placed in the public

domain by official disclosure by the United

Branch, such as by an official in the Executive

authorized to declassify the item, or by

a report of a Congressional committee, or by.

the courts.

3.

Bach

addressee is requested to appoint a

focal point officer to review each component's

respective items which are held by this office.

This office also has the DDO documentation submitted

in support of deleting each item in 1973. These can

be reviewed by each focal point official as necessary.

## Page 4

13-00000

A review will also be needed of those items which

may have been cleared or released by CIA when

reviewing manuscripts

submitted by other authors

since the publication

of the Marchetti book.

few items will need to be referred by some of the

components

to other departments and agencies of

government

for their review.

Please advise this office of the name of

your focal point officer by COB 11 April 1977.

the King. The result was what Hussein

culled"

"my first and very last words"

The Washington Post's recclation of the

payments and their possible impact on

chances for peace in the Middle Bust.

Some excerpts:

DE BORCHGRAVE: How much truth is

there in the story that appeared in The Wash-

ington Post?

HUSSEIN: The whole thing is ridicu-

lous and insulting. But I am prepared to

answer questions about it.

Q. Your government spokesman said the

story was a combination of "fabrication and

distortion." What has been fabricated and

what has been distorted?

A. What was fabricated in the story was

everything about funds handed over.per-

sonally for private benefit. When friend-

ly Arab countries extend aid, it has been

traditional for the checks to be made but

to the Head of State, which then are

deposited'in the state budget account.

This is not an uncommon practice. All

assistance received by us is handled in

the same way. What is truo is that for a

number of years, we have been offered

security ind

intelligence

which the goverument of Jordan accept-

ed gratefull:

As tor thie story that the ClA Daid for

the protection of my children at school

in America, my request was made to the

State Department which kindly agreed

to ensure their security. Romember that

there have been many extremist plots

against me and my family and this was a

perfectly normal request. If Amy Carter

decided to come to school in Jordan,

we would, needless to say, be responsi-

ble for her security and would not be

sending a bill to the U.S. Goverment

for an elementary courtesy and security

measure.

Q. How do you feel about President Carter

ordering the arrangement-code-named "No

Beef' stopped?

A. We had, I promise you, never heard

anything about all this before. If the

reference is to the assistance we have

been receiving for security and intolli-

gence, then I have not been advised

about its suspension, either officially or

unofficially.

Q. The Intelligence Oversight Board set up

in February 1976 reported to President Ford'a

few months later that they regarded the pay-

ments as improper and he did nothing about

it. What do you feel was improper about those

Jayments?

A. What is a proper say to support a

friend and ally is strictly your business:

as I am concemed, anything I can get

for Jordan and my people is proper.

And five of your Presidents [Eisenhow-

er,

thought so, too.

A. Throughout all these years I have

been very proud of the growing strength

of the relationship with our American

friends. We identifed with principles

your forefathers held dear.

We built

our relations

on the basis of mutual

respect, confidence and faith, and be-

yond that

anything I did to cement

relations with the U.S. was based on i

deep conviction about our common ob-

jectives-stability, peace am progress

in the Middle East.

My duty is to develop my country, its

human resources, armed forces and secu-

rity and intelligence services, to face the

tremendous threats that lie ahead. The

road is strewn with mines to sabotage the

peace process. One has just exploded in

Washington. There will be others. But

bear in mind that Jordan is not mique in

receiving such holp. Israel falls into the

same category and is a far greater cxam-

ple of all kinds of assistance. As far as I

,in concerned, these will be my first and

very last cords on that matter. My por

sonal pride is a very touchy subicet. And

my main concern is to preserve Jordan in

freedom

Finally, regarding your media attacks

against a branch of your govenment, if

you choose to denude a vital arm that is

there to protect you, that is vour affair,

not fordan's.

The position of CCS on

all four items is that they are still classified, since they

describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an

operational support facility located in the U.S.,

and are

therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B) (2)

of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive

Order 11652.

was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-

ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency

proprietaries.

sponsorshif sachet

CCS files are unclear on the point, but there

are indications that Director Colby may have responded to

the question in a manner which could have been construed as

admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In any case, CCS

files contain other evidence that the matter was considered

to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when

Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal

Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-

ways and

asked that the subject be withheld from public

disclosure.

the list the book The Invisible Government, by Wise and

INC. Intermountain Aviation,

Inc. is named

as an Agency proprietary in Book I of

the Senate Select Committee Final Report,

.PP: 208-9,

and in the Report of the Rockefeller Commission on

CIA Activities Within the United States, Pg. 218.

4. The following items fall into the questionable area

as to whether they have been placed in the public domain by

authorized Government officials:

Item 49, page 71a -- ROME DAILY AMERICAN.

Classified SECRET because it describes intelligence

sources and methods as related to several newspaper

publications. However, CCS files contain a newsclip

from the September and

October 1974 edition of the

Columbia Journalism Review which states,

"Landon K.

Jr., the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA,

Wall Street law firm of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore,

now acknowledge that the fourth partner lin the

purchase of the Rome Daily American in 1956] was the

CIA.

[Bross] recently called the arrangement

'atypical'

of what the Agency was doing, 'a bad example'."

It is

questionable whether the remarks made by Mr. Bross, who

retired from the Agency in' 1971, and Mr. Shute, who

left the Agency long before that, can be considered

• as constituting official Agency disclosure of this

information.

Item 54, page 80 and item 236, page 262 -- FORUM

WORLD FEATURES.

Classified SECRET because they describe

intelligence sources and methods and identification of

operations based in England. Forum World features was

referred to

-- but not by name -- in Book I of the Senate

select Committee final Report, page 199, as follows:

'Another example of the damages of propagandal "fallout'

involved two proprietary news services that the CIA main-

tained in Europe

.... the larger of the two was subscribed

to by over 30

U.S. newspapers.

In an effort to reduce the

problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the

Chief, Covert Action Staff

The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence

by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

Memo for All Divisions and Certain Staffs,

from

SA/DO/O, 8 April 1977, same subject

Following are Covert Action Staff comments on items

24, 48, 54, 55, 56, 236, and 280, which are among the

passages containing classified information that were de-

leted before publication of the Marchetti-Marks manuscript:

a)

Items 24 (p. 47), 55 (p. 80), 56 (p. 81),

and 280 (p. 404) are

classified secret, and are

exempt from publication under Section 5 (b) (2) of

EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and

methods of operation.

Specifically, these items

name RTV, Inc. and describe it as a CIA proprietary

that was used for clandestine operations in a variety

of countries.

In addition, items 55 and 56 are

especially sensitive because they describe an opera-

tion in Jordan, exposure of which could be harmful to

United States

relations in the Middle East ( Section

5 b 3).

b) Items 54 and 236 (on p. 80 and p. 262) are

classified secret, and are exempt from publication

under

Section (5)

(b) (2) 0f E0 11652, which protects

intelligence sources and methods of operation..

These

items name Forum World Features, describe it as a CIA

proprietary that was used for clandestine propaganda

operations, specify that the clandestine operations

were

directed

especially at the Third World, and further

specify that the man who ran FWF was an experienced

CIA operator.

It may be worth noting that the Senate

Select Committee declined to publish the name of this

clandestine proprietary when the Agency advised the

Committee that publication would damage the former

director of Forum World Features, who had entered into

a clandestine relationship with the U.S. Government in

good faith.

c) Item 48 (p. 71a) is classified secret, and

is exempt from publication under Section 5 (5) (2)

of EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and

methods of operation. This item

names African Forum,

Africa Report, Preuves, Encounter,

Forum as

magazines that received CIA subsidies. In the case

of Preuves, Encounter, and Forum, these magazines were

published by the former Congress

for Cultural Freedom.

The Government has not acknowledged covertly subsidizing

ties to CIA have been the subject of press speculation.

Preuves magazine has been the subject of little or no

press speculation, as far as we know, and it is our

understanding that French laws prohibit covert foreign

subsidies to French publications, which makes it

especially important to protect the former CIA tie to

that magazine.

would be damaging to a number of prominent people and

organizations in this country and in Africa that have

worked for improved social conditions in Africa and for

good relations between this country and Africa, which

would be harmful to this country's relations with Africa.

:

Review of 168 Deleted Items in

"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence"

by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

(U) 1. This is the report of the review done by

the appropriate DDO components of those deleted items

which are the basic responsibility of the DDo.

The

remaining deleted items which are the basic responsi

bility of the DDS&T and DDA were reviewed by those

Directorates which are reporting directly to OGC.

Responsible components did the necessary inter- and

intraagency coordinations.

(U)

2.

Several points need to be highlighted

concerning

the completeness of the review,

especially

as regards those items declassified by "official

public disclosure" as defined by the courts.

While I

am sure that as diligent a search as possible was done

by the DDO components, a thorough and absolutely

complete search is impossible for the following reasons:

(U) a. There is no index of any kind,

let alone having the material in machine form

such as in the RSM, to the fifteen published

hearings and reports of the Senate Select

Committee to Study Governmental Operations With

Respect to Intelligence Activities (Church

Committee), the six published hearings and

proceedings of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence (Pike Committee) or the one volume

available record of precisely what information

has been declassified and released in accordance

with the Freedom of Information Act and the

There is no available record of

the information that officials of the Executive

Branch of government, with authority to

declassify information, have said or written

in public either before Congressional

committees, TV talk shows, radio talk shows,

In view of the above, it is impossible to guarantee

that those items which are still classified by the

DDO components have not been deliberately or

inadvertently declassified in whole or in part as

"official public disclosure."

(U) 3.

Bearing in mind the above, attachment A

lists those items of

the DDO deleted items which have

been declassified by "official public disclosure."

These thirteen complete and parts of four other

items

can therefore be released from the court injunction.

(S).

4.

Attachment B (seven parts) contains

eleven

deleted items (seven subjects) which are still

classified but about which there may be some possible

question.

These are highlighted here so that

cognizance can be taken and final decisions made with

due regard for all legal and policy aspects.

Item No. 22, 28, 152, 172 MSS PP. no. 46, 48, 165, 189

(U) NE Division has highlighted these items:

(S)

Item 22 states in part "A notable example of such

a

'special relationship' is Iran, where a CIA organized coup

d'etat restored the Shah to power

in 1953.

The Shah was

understandably grateful..."

. Item 28 lists the Shah

other

"world leaders with whom CIA has developed special

relationships" as does Item 152 and

a similar statement is

made in Item 179.

(U) Ray S. Cline in his book "Secrets, Spies and

Scholars," pp. 131-132, states:

a covert operation so successful that it

became widely known all over the world was carried

out in Iran.

The Shah,

then very young, had been

driven.out of Iran by his left-leaning Premier,

Mohammed Mossadegh, whose support came from the

local Communist (Tudeh) Party and from the Soviet

Union. CIA mounted a modest effort under a skillful

clandestine services officer who flew to Iran,

hired

enough street demonstrators to intimidate

those working for Mossadegh, instructed Iranian

military men

loyal to the Shah how to take over

the local radio station, and paved the way for the

Shah's triumphal return."

(U)

The Church Committee, Book 1, p. 111, briefly

mentioned "the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh

in Iran"

as one of CIA's "boldest, most spectacular covert

operations."

deleted items speaking about an active "special relationship".

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of the Rome Daily

American is still classified SECRET because it describes

intelligence sources and methods as related to newspaper

CCS files contain a newsclip from the

September and October 1974 edition of the Columbia

Journalism Review which states; "Landon K.

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of Forum World

describe intelligence. sources and methods and identifies

operations based in England.

Forum World Features was

referred to - but not by name - in Book I of the Church

Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows: "Another

example of the damages of 'fallout' involved two

proprietary news services that the CIA maintained in

turope...

The larger of the two was subscribed to by

over thirty U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the

problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the

najor U.S. dailies aware that the CIA controlled these

two press

services." While Forum World Features was not

named in the Senate report and therefore continues to be

protected, it is possible that ClA disclosure to newspaper

editors may be considered

as "official public disclosure."

(S) Under injunction as classified information is

"For

its Tibetan operation of the early sixties,

the

Agency constructed extensive support facilities in

to a deserted Army base in Colorado for special training.

Underlining (line 25, ninth thru twenty-third word)

indicates the questionable part of the item since MSS

prout lines 24-26 states "Some Tibetans were quietly

to the United States for special paramilitary

training at Camp Hale in the mountains of Colorado."

This sentence was originally deleted, then reinstated and

appears

in boldface type on page 115

(U) NE Division has highlighted this item.

(S) The deleted item is "The CIA quickly made contact

with the Dalai Lama and a close relationship was established.

and advised by Agency covert operators, he was..."

(U) Harry Rositzke, in his book "The CIA's Secret

Operations" pp. 173-174, states "As the Korean war was

winding down,

the CIA began sending intelligence agents

into Tibet to assess the

situation and see what could be

done to forestall the Chinese takeover that was in the

offing. Tibetan agents equipped with radios were dispatched

by air and made contact with the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, giving

him a channel of communication with the West.

"When the Dalai Lama chose to flee from Lhasa to

avoid capture by the Chinese

forces in 1959, he was

accompanied on his flight by a CIA-trained radio operator

who was able to keep Washington posted on his often

hazardous progress."

(S) The classified deleted item speaks of a CIA

"close relationship" with the Dalai Lama and his being

"financed and advised" by CIA which is quite different

from Rositzke's statement about CIA trained radio operators

being with the Dalai Lama.

These are two different

comments with

the first being properly classifiable and

ATTACHMENT B (6)

Item No. 107, 128, 129, 279

MSS pp. 123, 132, 133, 403

(S) CCS states that all four items which refer to

Fairways Corporation as a CIA-owned proprietary company

are

still classified since they describe intelligence

sources and methods by identifying an operational support

facility located in the U.S. and are therefore exempt from

declassification under Section 5 (B) (2) of the General

Declassification Schedule contained in Executive Order 11652.

(S) According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director

Colby was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship

of Fairways Corporation in connection with a planned TV

documentary on Agency proprietaries. CCS files are unclear

on the point, but there are indications that Director Colby

may have responded to the question in a manner which

could have been construed as admission of sponsorship of

Fairways.

In any case, CCS files contain other evidence

that the matter was considered to be still classified as

recently as December 19/6, when Director Bush wrote to

he Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administratior

regarding CIA sponsorship of Fairways and asked that. the.

subject be withheld from public disclosure.

Item No. 339

MSS p. no. 509

David Phillips in his book The Night Watch,

chapter 8, pp. 212-235, entitled "Brazil, Venezuela 1970-

1972" describes his presence as Chief of Station of CIA

in Brazil and on page 209 he discusses CIA in Bolivia.

(S) In regard to the declassification of CIA presence

in the Congo (Attachment A, Item 339, MSS p. no. 509),

Africa Division states "The existence of a CIA presence

in the Congo is reported

in an interim report of the Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975.

It may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification

of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of

singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged

target of CIA operations.

effect on our relations with the government of Zaire. We

believe the item should remain classified

and that

exemption 5 (b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo."

It is not a question of whether to agree or not

to declassification of reference to the Congo.

The Church

Committee

report as cited in Attachment A has

already made

"official-public disclosure" of the matter, rendering the

subject moot.

In addition, as Item 339 in Attachment A

shows,

four other countries of the Third World are also

mentioned, thereby not singling out the Congo alone.

adverse effect could be expected now. by another public

reference to CIA presence in the Congo as of the original

1974 publication date of the Marchetti/Marks book, is

difficult to comprehend.

Since the government of Zaire has

not changed since the 1975 release of the information by

the Church Committee, it would seem that whatever adverse

affects there might be have already occurred.

(S) Item 22 states in part "A notable example of such

a 'special relationship' is Iran, where a CIA organized coup

d'etat restored the Shah to power in 1953. The Shah was

understandably grateful..."

Item 28 lists the Shah among

(U)

The Church Committee, Book 1, p. 111, brietly

mentioned "the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran"

as one of CIA's "boldest, most spectacular covert

operations."

(S) There is a vast difference between the classified

deleted items speaking about an active "special relationship"

with the Shah following the

overthrow of Mossadegh and a

statement about CIA's role in overthrowing Mossadegh. The

former is still properly classifiable and classified.

Item No. 49

MSS p. no. 7la

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of the Rome Daily

American is still classified SECRET because it describes

intelligence sources and methods as related to newspaper

publications.

CCS files contain a newsclip from the

September and October 1974 edition of the Columbia

Journalism Review which states, "Landon K. Thorne, Jr.,

and a lawyer

of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore, now acknowledge that the

fourth partner [in

the purchase of the Rome Daily American

in 1956] was the CIA.

(Bross] recently called the arrange-

ment 'atypical' of what

the Agency was doing, 'a bad

example'."

It is questionable whether the remarks made by

Mr. Bross, who retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute,

who left the Agency long before that, can be considered

as constituting official Agency disclosure of this

information.

Item No. 54, 236

MSS p. no. 80, 262

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of Forum World

Features is still classified SECRET because both items

describe intelligence sources and methods and identifies

operations based in England. Forum World Features was

referred to - but not by name - in Book I of the Church

Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows:

"Another

example of the damages

of "fallout' involved

two

proprietary news services that the CIA maintained in

Europe..

The larger of the two was subscribed to by

over thirty U.S. newspapers.

In an effort to reduce the

problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the

major U.S. dailies

aware that the CIA controlled these

two press services."

While Forum World Features was not

named in the Senate report and therefore continues to be

protected, it is possible that CIA disclosure to newspaper

editors may be considered

as "official public disclosure."

MSS. pp. 123, 132, 133, 403

(S) CCS states that all four items which refer to

Fairways Corporation as

a CIA-owned proprietary company

are still classified since they describe intelligence

sources and methods by identifying an operational support

facility located in the U.S. and

are therefore exempt from

declassification under Section 5 (B) (2) of the General

Declassification Schedule contained in Executive Order 11652.

(S) According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director

Colby was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship

of Fairways Corporation in connection with a planned TV

documentary on Agency proprietaries: CCS files are unclear

on the point, but there are indications that Director Colby

may have responded to the question in a manner which

could have been construed

as admission of sponsorship of

Fairways.

In any case, CCS files contain other evidence

that the matter was considered to be still classitled as

recently as December 19/6, when Director Bush wrote Lo

the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration

regarding CIA sponsorship of Fairways and

asked that the

subject be withheld from public disclosure.

Item No. 339

David Phillips in his book The Night Watch,

in Brazil and on page 209 he discusses CIA in Bolivia.

(S) In regard to the declassification of CIA presence

in the Congo (Attachment A, Item 339, MSS p. no. 509),

Africa Division states "The existence of a CIA presence

in the Congo is reported in an interim report of the Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975.

It may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification

of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of

singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged

target of CIA operations.

This would have an adverse

effect on our relations with

the government of Zaire.

believe the item should remain classified and that

exemption 5 (b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo."

It is not a question of whether to agree or not

to declassification of reference to the Congo.

The Church

Committee report as cited in Attachment A has already made

"official-public disclosure" of the matter, rendering the

subject moot. In addition, as Item 339 in Attachment A

shows, four other countries of the Third World are also

mentioned, thereby not singling out the Congo alone.

What

adverse effect could be

expected now by another public

reference to CIA presence in the Congo as of the original

1974 publication date of the Marchetti/Marks book, is

difficult to comprehend.

Since the government of Zaire has

not changed since the 1975 release of the information by

the Church Committee, it would seem that whatever advers

effects

there might be have already occurred.

Hussein and the U.S. Government became increasingly concerned about the

strong and strident propaganda voice of Radio Cairo. Both parties shared a

desire to counter its anti-American, anti-Hussein line (which was notinew),

so the CIA funded the building of a Jordanian television station. A CIA

owned, New York based proprietary company, named RTV, provided the technical

expertise and management skills to put the station in operation.

Still another example of a country where the CIA enjoys a spectal

relationship is Nationalist CHina. On Taiwan, however, the CIA's link is

not with President Chiang Kai-shek but with his son and heir apparent,

Premier Chiang Ching-Kuo. One former CIA chief of station, Ray Cline, now the

State Department's Director of Intelligence and Research, became something

of a legend within the Clandestine Services because of his frequent all-

night drinking boutswith the younger chiang.

Lover the years, the CIA closely collaborated with the Nationalists first

625

to run guerrilla attacks against mainland China and then in more recent

years to use Taiwan as a base for U-2 flights (flown over China by Nationalist

pilots trained in the United States), electronic surveillance of the mainland

and such covert action programs as propaganda and disinformation aimed at

China during the Cultural Revolution. /

In South Vietaam, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker insisted on personally

conducting all important me sings with President Thieu; sometimes Bunker was

accompanied by the CIA chief, when there was Agency business to be discussed.

But there has been another CIA officer in Saigon who has known Thieu for

many years and who has retained access to the Vietnamese President.

According to a former assistant to Ambassador Bunker, this CIA officer has

served as conduit between Thieu and the American government when a formal

meeting is not desired or when Thieu wishes to float an idea.

the information straight forwardly, thereby, handicapping the analysts in making

a confident judgment of the accuracy of the report's content. *

Some intelligence analysts, both inside and outside the CIA, receivei

large numbers of this type of report every day, many of which do come from

actual agents. But by mixing together information supplied by audio surveillance

(which is, by definition, an accuaate account of what was adid) with agent

reports which are sometimes exaggerated or false, the Clandestine Services

confuses and often misleads those people within the U.S. government whose

function it is to analyse foreign events and indirectly those leaders who make

decisions based on that intelligence analysis.

Lin. the mid-1960s, the Far East Diviston of the Clandestine Services and

the experts of the Scientific and Tachnical Directorate combindddféoces to

carry out one of the Agency's most imaginative (if ultimately unsuccessful)

Intelligence collection operations ever undertaken. At that time, top-level

U.S. government officials were disturbed by repprts that Cormunist China was on

the verge of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system.

They knew that the threat posed by Chinese ICBN's would play an important part

in the decision, then under consideration, to go ahead with an American anti-

ballistic missile (ABM) deployment program. As a matter of the highest

priority, the CIA was told to find out what was happening at Shuangch'engtzu, the

Chinese missile test site in the far western corner of Inner Mongolia.

The Agency's technical specialists responded by designing a nuclear-

powered device which could monitor certain key electronic emissions coming from

the missile site, well over a thousand miles away, and then rely the information

to a CIA listening post. The plan was to emplace the device on a mountain

peak called the Nanda Devi, at an altitude of more than 25,000 feet, in the

Indian Himalayas from where it would have an unobstructed "line-of-sight" to

the secret test facility. As the device was being perfected in the CIA

Tahoratories. the Clandestine Services took on the responsibility for the most/

difficult pliase of the operation - installing the machine on the mountain top.

The first thing that had to be done was to gain the permission of the

Indian government to implement the scheme, not a large problem in view of the

CIA's close relations with the Indian intelligence service. The Indians not

only agreed but, surprisingly, insisted on full participation in the project.

Next, the Agency recruited a group of experienced mountain climbers to carry

the device, complete with its nuclear powerpack, pp the mountain and put it

into operation. A well-known American mountaineer who had previously conquered

Mt. Everest, Barry Bishop, was contacted and convinced to lead the climb.

Overall control of the operation, however, was placed in the hands of an experienced

CIA case officer.

That summer, the Agency operator along with the American and Indian

climbers, and a group of Sherpa porters, were brought together at a secret

CIA training base in the Rocky Mountains to practice as a team and to learn

how to assemble the monitoring device once they got it to the top of Nanda Devi.

Cover for the operation was carefully built by leaking information in international

mountaineering circles that a joint American-Indian expedition was planning an

ascent of one of the more difficult Himalayan peaks. During the winter, the

technicians completed work on the sensor device, and a few months later the

CIA chief of station in Delhi reported that all logistical and cover arrangements

with Indian intelligence had been completed. The monitoring device was

clandestinely flown to a secure staging area in northern India by a transport

plane from one of the Agency's proprietary airlines. Next, the climbers were

brought together and taken to the camp in the foothills of the Himalayas from

where they and the Sherpas would begin their long, difficult ascent of the Nanda

Devi.

Things went well at first, but after the expedition passed the snow line, the

Indians began to tire and became irascible, claiming that they were backpacking

too much weight. The CIA case officer redistributed the load by convincing the

would do. Progress slowed and, behind schedule, the team reached the base

camp from where the final ascent to the mountain's summit would be made by

a small party of climbers accompanied by a few porters. Soon after the

group had started for the peak, one of the Sherpas returned to base camp to

tell the ClA man, who had remained behind to handle communications with the

staging area, that the Indians were causing trouble at the higher altitudes.

The case officer immediately set out to reach Bishop and the summit team in

an effort to restore peace among the climbers. The project was now well off

schedule, and any more delays would have endangered the entire expedition

because of the onset of bad weather. With some difficulty, the Agency

operator was able to get the team moving again, and it finally reached its

target near the top of the Nanda Devi. Amidst howling winds and at temperatures

well below zero, the climbers assembled the monitoring device and put it into

operation. With spirits high, the group returned to base camp and the news

of the successful installation was sadioed back to the staging. area.

But within a few short months, the signals that the sensor had been

sending from the Nanda Devi stopped. The CIA dispatched a plane to fly over

the mountain and photograph the monttoring site. It was learned that the

device had been knocked over by a snow slide. When the Indian government

was informed of the development, it complained to the CIA station in Delhi

that the nuclear generator might be polluting the headgaters of the sacred

Ganghes River which flow out of the Himalayas. The Indian concern was about

religious pollution, not ecological.

The CIA reacted by planning another climbeof the mountain for the following

year, both to retrieve the damaged equipment and implace a new monitoring

system - this one powered by a non-nuclear generator. The climbing team,

led by Bishop, was gathered together again and this time it reached the

top of the mountain with comparatively little difficulty. The new device was

set up, but after an extensive search, the atomic generator from the year

before was not-found. Again after only a few weeks, the second sensor devic

stopped working. This time the failure was attributed to a mechanical

malfunction.

At this point, the Agency gave up on mountain-top monitoring of the

Cormunist Chinese missile program, turning to other systems and new, improved

satellites for acquiring the information it was segking. The Indtans were

thanked and compensated for their cooperation. A The American climbers were

The fertile imagnations of the saT experts during the following

years produced many more unique codirction schemes aimed at solving the

mysteries of China's strategic missile program. Most

eventually proved to be

unworkable, and at least one entailed a frighteningly high-risk potential.

The silliest of them all, however, called for the creation of a small one-man

airplane that could theoretically be packaged in two large suitcases. In

concept, an agent along with the suitcases would somehow be infiltrated into

the denied area where, after performing his espionage mission, he would

assemble the aircraft and fly to safety over the nearest friendly border.

Even the chief of the Clandestine Services refused to have anything to do with

this scheme, and the projectydied on the drawing boards.

A second system was a device, long and tubular like a rocket, that could

slowed by a parachute so that the device would penetrate only two or three

feet into the ground on impact. Afterwards, the system, anaerial rising from

specialists, fascinated by the technical aspects of the project, seemed, however

oblivious of the dangers involved in secretly flying near a Chinese missile

installation and dropping an object in an action that could quite easily appear

to a startled radar operator as a lone bomber engaging in a surprise nuclear

attack. Development of the Cossly system was, therefore, pushed ahead. The

technicians were more concerned with the fact that the test drops of the device

in the southwestern U.S, desert usually resulted in the system burying itself

several feet below the ground surface or so jarring the delicate instrumentation

that the device failed to self-activate and function property._!

third system was a model airplane roughly the size of a large bird,

such as a condor, which was powered by a miniature nuclear engine and which

could be launched from outside China and guided to the missile test site well

over a thousand miles away, all the while soaring in patterns that would resemble

on the air defense radar scopes the flight patterns of a large eagle. Once

over the target, the plane's electronic sensors and tiny television cameras

would be turned on to record activities below and relay the information either

to its launch site or much more likely a hovering aircraft that had penetrated

Chinese airspace for this purpose. Millions of dollars were expended by the

CIA in research on this "baby U-2" that called for numerous breakthroughs in

allowing the Agency to use Iran as a base for electronic and radar surveillance

of the Soviet Union. The CIA station chief in Iran usually maintained much

closer contact with the Shah than the American ambassador. (With the 1973

the case, CIA representatives carried out most of the negotiations with the

However, when Ambassador Armin Meyer was informed of the details of

the proposed agreement, he raised some questions with the CIA station chief that 5

blossomed into an inter-agency dispute. At this point Meyer cabled the State

Department for instructions and advice.

In the way of background, it should be understood that CIA communications

clerks handle nearly all classified cables between American embassies overseas

and Washington - for both the CIA and the State Department. To have a separate

code room for each agency in every embassy would be a wasteful procedure, so a

senior CIA communications expert is regularly assigned to the administrative

part of the State Department in order to oversee CIA's communicators who work

under State cover. In theory, CIA code clerks are not supposed to read the

messages they send for State, but any code clerk who wants to have a successful

career quickly realized that his promotions depend on the CIA and that he is

well advised to show the CIA station chief eppies of all important State

messages. The State Department long ago implicitly recognized that its most

secret cables are not secure from CIA inspection by setting up special

situation in private with his superiors.

But Bob and his cohorts at FI/D were

one step ahead of Ambassador Meyer. They had figured out a way to intercept

his cables and the replies he received from Washington. So shortly after each

State message was sent, Bob would appear in the CIA executive suite with a copy

of the message for the personal inspection of the Director. Written on top of

each intercepted cable was a warning that the contents of the cable should be

kept especially confident because State was unaware that the CIA had a copy.

Despite Agency knowledge of all of Meyer's instructions and information,

Meyer and State's director of Iranian Affairs in Washington refused to yield

to Agency pressure for a quick settlement. Even after these two men met at .

CIA headquarters with the Deputy Director of CIA, Vice Admiral Rufus Taylor,

they still insisted that the Agency's plans for the new installation were

unacceptable to the U.S. government as a whole. CIA Director Helms was so

aggravated by this continued resistance that he personally telephoned Secretary

of State Rusk to settle the matter. Rusk promptly ended the dispute by agreeing

completely to the CIA position.

Bob was also involved in another serfes of events which started when FI/D

worked out a liaison arrangement with the codebreaking service of a certain

South American government. This arrangement was ostensibly for the purpose of

allowing the CIA and the other country to cooperate in decoding messages sent

by third countries. However, FI/D tood advantage of the liaison to intercept

the secret communications of the host South American government. Such arrangements

were normal procedure to Bob. The intensely dedicated law and order advocate saw

nothing wrong in practicing this sort of duplicity on an allied government which

cooperated in good faith.

FI/D's liaison with the South American country continued for a long period

of time until relations between the United States and that nation soured over

unrelated issues, and as a result FI/D was forced to break off the relationship.

However, FI/D did not give up hope that the previous working arrangements could

Sometime later, Bob suggested to an officer in the CIA's executive suite

that the Agency should help the South American country obtain a channel in the

international satellite communications network, Comsat. Always the secretive

operator, Bob did not explain why the Agency should do this, and the other

CIA man replied that CIA, afterall, was not the American foreign aid program; and

tether or not this particular country received a Comsat channel did not seem to

be a matter concer. ing CIA. Only later did the executive suite officer learn

7

from other sources that FI/D had worked out a deal with the South American

country in which liaison would be restored in return for a Comsat channel (which

CIA. would intercept). But Bob could not bring himself to share his scheme sen

yith a fellow Agency employee in the Director's office.

Eventually, the South American country received the Comsat channel; the

country restored liaison with FI/D; and CIA again had access to all of that

11

country's secret messages.

Bob's job with FI/D is by no means one of the dirtiest jobs in the

15

Clandestine Services. There are operators in the paramilitary fields who

probably conceive and carry out more distasteful machinations. But Bob is in

17

a position where, on a regular basis, he misrepresents himself and even lies

within the U.S. government - not to mention the deceit he and his colleagues 11

perpetrate on friendly foreign governments which in good faith enter into

liaison agreements with FI/D.

lie detector man, a CIA case officer, and the local agent were

soon all under ürrest. The singapore government and the British,

who ware in the process of granting Singapore its independences

were both quite disturbed bythe indident. Negotiations then

ensued to secure the men's release.. According to Singapore

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the US government offered 3-3 mil-

lion to get them out. Lee claimed that he wanted ten times as

much and consequently took nothing. In any case, the tro CLA

officials vere subsequently freed, the newly installed secretary

of state, Dean Rusk, wrote a secret letter of apology to the

Singapore leader. In 1965, Lee mentioned the affair in a speech

as an example of the type of activities engaged in by the CIA.

The State Department then issued a routine denial furnished by

the CIA-State's press office not realizing the truth of Lee's

charges. Lee reacted by publicly producing Rusk"s letter of a-

pology, and state was forced to retract its original statement,

although it still maintained that no ranson had ever been offered.

As well, as embarrassing the US government and making headlines

around the world, the incident caused the state Department to

revamp its internal system for naking announcements about in

telligenca matters.

Blacknall was agin the theme in the nic 1960s when the

296

President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, quietly informed the

installation for surveillance of the Chinese mainland. When the

device was turned on for the first time, it knocked out a large

part of the island's power. In this case, the local goverrment

reacted in a much more friendly manner than did Singapore®s.

Finally, government negotiators reached a secret deal with the

wily old archbishop, and he received a special payment of about

$10 million in return for letting the bases renain. The CIA

put up half of the money, using the Director's Contingency Fund

for this unforseen expense.

The only American military bases in Africa are in fact pri-

and Kenitra in lorocco. Both host governments have been severely

criticized by internal forces and neizhboring countries for

giving the United States a foothold in their nations, but both

have been handsomely rewarded in terms of receiving American

military and economic assistance which had added up over the

years into the hundreds of millions of dollars,. While campara

tively modest amounts of aid would have probably been supplied,

even if there had been no bases, the large size of the programs

represented, in effect, a direct payment for the intelligence

penetration, while clearly fortuitous, are not unique in clandestine operations. 1

In 1964, it was learned that the American embassy in Moscow had been thoroughly z

bugged by the KGB. Scores of Soviet audio devices were found throughout the .

building. Counterespionage and security specialists determined that the

4

equipment had been installed in 1952 when the embassy had been renovated, and

that the bugs had been operational for roughly twelve years. The damige report

asserted that during this entire pariod - at the height of the cold war -

Soviet iutelligence had probably intercepted every diplomatic cable between

7

$

Washington and the embassy.

This assessment was based on the discovery of elec

audio devices in the code room which woul tame allowed the Soviets to hear

distinctly the sounds being maded by the typewriters and cryptographic equipment.

It was a reasonably easy technological feat -- well within Soviet capabilities

to translate such sounds into their true alphabetical meaning

American suspicions about the Soviet eavesdropping were apparently aroused

early in 1964 when Soviet leader Khrusbchev made a remark to Ambassador Fay Fry

Kohler about Kabler's role in bocking the shipment to the Soviet Union of

steel for an important popeline. Taken in context, Khrushchev's remark indicated

to Kohler that there was a leak somewhere in American security. Kohler started

a massive investigation, and within a month or two, forty-odd bugs were found

embedded in walls throughout the embassy. Although Kohler would later claim

there was no connection between the discovery of the bugs and the investigation

he ordered after his conversation with Khrushchey, the timing would seen to

indicate otherwise.

In any case, the official damage report concluded that for those twelve

191

crucial years at the height of the Cold War, the Soviets almost certainly knew

every diplomatic secret which was communicated between the American embassy in

Moscow and Washington, The damage report noted, however, that this Soviet

knowledge may well have worked to the advantage of the United States at least

in one instance in 1953 when the Korean War armistice was being negotiated. At

the time, U.S. bargaining position with the florth Koreans was that if a particular?

Acting Executive Officer/DDA

Fairways Corporation

Attached memorandum from Central Cover Staff

:

1. With reference to paragraph 4 in the attached memorandum

from Mr. Latta, to the very best of our knowledge the CIA sponsorship

of the Fairways Corporation has not been officially placed in the

public domain.

There has been at least one newspaper article relating

to Fairways and, in addition, at least one short television news

item on the same subject.

However, official confirmation of the

allegations of a relationship which was made in these media presentations

has been carefully avoided.

There has been official acknowledgement of the fact that

CIA's Office of Training runs a proprietary to provide executive

transportation. Such a statement appeared in the report of the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. However, here

again there has been no acknowledgement that such an entity was

identical with or related to the Fairways Corporation.

The DDA concurs with the position of CCS as expressed in

paragraph 2 of Mr. Latta's memorandum.

1. Per our telephone conversation today.

attorneys

for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168

items previously deleted by court order from the book,

The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence.

Fairways Corpora-

tion was referred to CCS by the SA/DO/O for review in

this connection.

2.

Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items

(107, 128, 129, 279, on pages 123, 132, 133, and 403 respec-

original manuscript.

The position of CCS on

all four items is that they are still classified, since they

describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an

operational support facility located in the U.S.,

and are

therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B) (2)

of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive

Order 11652.

According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby

was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-

ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency

proprietaries.

CCS files are unclear on the point, but there

are indications that Director Colby may have responded to

the question in a manner which could have been construed as

admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways.

mansor snap ch

In any case, Cus

files contain other evidence that the matter was considered

to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when

Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal

Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-

ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public

disclosure.

Review of Deletions from The CIA and the

Cult of Intelligence by Marchetti and Marks

1. The responsible and knowledgeable components of this

directorate have reviewed the appropriate deletions from subject

book per your request.

The review was made to determine whether

each deletion was

still classified under EO 11652 or whether the

information in each deletion has been officially released by the

U.S. Government.

by this directorate.

fled; however, portions of one item, 135, can be released.

is a list of those items which we determined are still classified

under EO 11652; however, some portions of three items can be

released, but we recommend that all of the items in Tab C be

coordinated with other indicated elements. Tab D is a list of

items we determined are not of concern to this directorate and

should be referred to other indicated elements.

Tab E is a list

of the four items mentioned

above which we believe portions can

now be released.

The portions in red brackets remain classified

and should not be released.

3.

Since many of the deleted items involved the National

Security Agency (NSA), we attempted to coordinate our determina-

tions through our contacts at NSA.. We were told that any

coordination must be handled between the NSA and CIA General

Counsel.

AS

a result, no further coordination with other ele

ments was

attempted.

This memorandum completes the DDS&T action on the

court ordered review of the deletions from subject book.

Hussein and the U.S. Government became increasingly concerned about the

strong and strident propaganda voice of Radio Cairo. Both parties shared a

desire to counter its anti-American, antf-Hussein line (which was notinew),

so the CIA funded the building of a Jordanian television station. A CIA

owned, New York based proprietary company, named RTV, provided the technical

expertise and management skills to put the station in operation.

Still another example of a country where the CIA enjoys a special

relationship is Nationalist CHina. On Taiwan, however, the CIA's link is

not with President Chiang Kai-shek but with his son and heir apparent,

Premier Chiang Ching-Kuo. One former CIA chief of station, Ray Cline, now the

• State Department's Director of Intelligence and Research, became something

of a legend within the Clandestine Services because of his frequent all-

night drinking boutsywith the younger Chiang.

[Over the years, the CIA closely collaborated with the Nationalists first

to run guerrilla attacks against mainland China and then in more recent

years to use Taiwan as a base for U-2 flights. (flown over China by Nationalist

pilots trained in the United States), electronic surveillance of the mainland

and such covert action programs as propaganda and disinformation aimed at

China during the Cultural Revolution./

In South Vieteam, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker insisted on personally

conducting all important meetings with President Thieu; sometimes Bunker was

of station

accompanied by the CIA chief, when there was Agency business to be discussed.

But there has been another CIA officer in Saigon who has known Thieu for

many years and who has retained access to the Vietnamese President.

According to a former assistant to Ambassador Bunker, this CIA officer has

served as conduit between Thieu and the American government when a formal

meeting is not desired or when Thieu wishes to float an idea.

the information straight forwardly, thereby, handicapping the analysts in making

a confident judgment of the accuracy of the report's content.

*

Some Intelligence analysts, both inside and outside the CIA, receivei

large numbers of this type of report every day, many of which do come from

actual agents. But by mixing together information supplied by audio surveillance

(which is, by definition, an accurate account of what was said) with agent

reports which are sometimes exaggerated or false, the Clandestine Services

confuses and often misleads those people within the U.S. government whose

function it is to anälyze foreign events and indirectly those leaders who make

decisions based on that intelligence analysis.

In. the mid-1960s, the Far East Division of the Clandestine Services and

5

the experts of the Scientific and Tachnical Directorate combinedfonces to

carry out one of the Agency's most imaginative (if ultimately unsuccessful)

intelligence collection operations ever undertaken. At that time, top-level

U.S. government officials were disturbed by repprts that Conmunist China was on

the verge of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system.

They knew that the threat posed by Chinese ICB's would play an important part

in the decision, then under consideration, to go ahead with an American anti-

ballistic missile (ABM) deployment program. As a matter of the highest

priority, the CIA was told to find out what was happening at Shuangch'engtzu, the

Chinese missile test site in the far western corner of Inner Mongolia.

The Agency's technical specialists responded by designing a nuclear-

ppwered device which could monitor certain key electronic emissions coming from

the missile site, well over a thousand miles away, and then rely the information

to a CIA listening post. The plan was to emplace the device on a mountain

peak called-the Nanda Devi, at an altitude of more than 25,000 feet, in the

Indian Himalayas from where it would have an unobstructed "line-of-sight" to

the secret test facility. As the device was being perfected in the CIA

difficult phase of the operation - installing the machine on the mountain top.

140,

The first thing that had to be done was to gain the permission of the

Indian government to implement the scheme, not a large problem in view of the

CIA's close relations with the Indian intelligence service. The Indians not

only agreed but, surprisingly, insisted on full participation in the project.

Next, the Agency recruited a group of experienced mountain climbers to carry

the device, complete with its nuclear powerpack, pp the mountain and put it

into operation. A well-known American mountaineer who had previously conquered

Mt. Everest, Barry Bishop, was contacted and convinced to lead the climb.

Overall control of the operation, however, was placed in the hands of an experienced

CIA case officer.

That summer, the Agency operator along with the American and Indian

climbers, and a group of Sherpa porters, were brought together at a secret

CIA training base in the Rocky Mountains to practice as a team and to learn

how to assemble the monitoring device once they got it to the top of Nanda Devi.

Cover for the operation was carefully built by leaking information in international

mountaineering circles that a joint American-Indian expedition was planning an

ascent of one of the more difficult Himalayan peaks. During the winter, the

technicians completed work on the sensor device, and a few months later the

CIA chief of station in Delhi reported that all logistical and cover arrangements

with Indian intelligence had been completed. The monitoring device was

clandestinely flown to a secure staging area in northern India by a transport

plane from one of the Agency's proprietary airlines. Next, the climbers were

brought together and taken to the camp in the foothills of the Himalayas from

where they and the Sherpas would begin their long, difficult ascent of the Nanda

Devi.

Things went well at first, but after the expedition passed the snow line, the

Indians began to tire and became irascible, claiming that they were backpacking

would do. "Progress slowed and, behind schedule, the team reached the base

camp from where the final ascent to the mountain's summit would be made by

a small party of climbers accompanied by a few porters. Soon after the

group had started for the peak, one of the Sherpas returned to base camp to

tell the CIA man, who had remained behind to handle conmunications with the

staging area, that the Indians were causing trouble at the higher altitudes.

The case officer immediately set out to reach Bishop and the summit team in

an effort to restore peace among the climbers. The project was now well off

schedule, and any more delays would have endangered the entire expedition

because of the onset of bad weather. With some difficulty, the Agency

operator was able to get the team moving again, and it finally reached its

target near the top of the Nanda Devi. Amidst howling winds and at temperatures

well below zero, the climbers assembled the monitoring device and put it into

operation. With spirits high, the group returned to base camp and the news

of the successful installation was radioed back to the staging area.

But within a few short months, the signals that the sensor had been

sending from the Nanda Devi stopped. The CIA dispatched a plane to fly over

the mountain and photograph the monitoring site. It was learned that the

device had been knocked over by a snow slide. When the Indian government

was informed of the development, it complained to the CIA station in Delhi

that the nuclear generator might be polluting the headyaters of the sacred

Ganghes River which flow out of the Himalayas. The Indian concern was about

religious pollution, not ecological.

The CIA reacted by planning another climbeof the mountain for the following

year, both to retrieve the damaged equipment and implace a new monitoring

system - this one powered by a non-nuclear generator. The climbing team,

led by Bishop, was gathered together again and this time it reached the

top of the mountain with comparatively little difficulty. The new device was

set up, but after an extensive search, the atomic generator from the year

before was not-found. Again after only a few weeks, the second sensor device /L2

stopped working. This time the failure was attributed to a mechanical

malfunction.

At this point, the Agency gave up on mountain-top monitoring of the

Conmunist Chinese missile program, turning to other systems and new, improved

satellites for acquiring the information it was seeking. The Indians were

thanked and compensated for their cooperation. A The American climbers were

presented with secret medals by a grateful, but disappointed, CIA.

The fertile imagnations of the SaT experts during the following

years produced many more unique codirction schemes aimed at solving the

mysteries of China's strategic missile program. Most eventually proved to be

unworkable, and at least one entailed a frighteningly high-risk potential.

The silliest of them all, however, called for the creation of a small one-man

airplane that could theoretically be packaged in two large suitcases. In

concept, an agent along with the suitcases would somehow be infiltrated into

the denied area where, after performing his espionage mission, he would

assemble the aircraft and fly to safety over the nearest friendly border.

Even the chief of the Clandestine Services refused to have anything to do with

this scheme, and the projectydied on the drawing boards.

A second system was a device, long and tubular like a rocket, that could

be dropped by a U-2 or another aircraft near the missile test site, its fall

slowed by a parachute so that the device would panetrate only two or three

feet into the ground on impact. Afterwards, the system, anjaerial rising from

its top, would activate itself and perform its electronic sensing tasks. Still

later, the device would transmit its findings to a listening post, most

likely a circling aircraft. The need for secret air penetration deep into a

specialists, fascinated by the technical aspects of the project, seemed, however

oblivious of the dangers involved in secretly flying near a Chinese missile

installation and dropping an object in an action that could quite easily appear

to a startled radar operator as a lone bomber engaging in a surprise nuclear

attack. Development of the Cossly system was, therefore, pushed ahead. The

technicians were more concerned with the fact that the test drops of the device

in the southwestern U.S. desert usually resulted in the system burying itself

several feet below the ground surface or so jarring the delicate instrumentation

that the device failed to self-activate and function properly.

third system was a model airplane roughly the size of a large bird,

such as a condor, which was powered by a miniature nuclear engine and which

could be launched from outside China and guided to the missile test site well

over a thousand miles away, all the while soaring in patterns that would resemble

on the air defense radar scopes the flight patterns of a large eagle. Once

over the target, the plane's electronic sensors and tiny television cameras

would be turned on to record activities below and relay the information either

to its lauach site or much more likely a hovering aircraft that had penetrated

Chinese airspace for this purpose. Millions of dollars were expended by the

CIA in research on this "baby U-?" that called for numerous breakthroughs in

to be,

the state of the technical arts. Its chief advantase was of course, that if

and when it was shot down there would be no pilot to confess it had been on an

Agency-sponsored spying mission.

The technical difficulties involved in the air-drop system and the [model

fatriane device were too great and time consuming for either to be fully

developediby their inventors before improvements in intelligence satellite

surveillance programs were achieved, thus negating the justifying requirement

for these questionabls and potentially provocative collection systems before

they could be put into operation. Other clandestine collection devices - a few

more sensibly contrived, most, however, of dubious value - were also being

situation. in private with his superiors.

But Bob and his cohorts at Fi/D were

one step ahead of Ambassador Meyer. They had figured out a way to intercept

his cables and the replies he received from Washington. So shortly after each

State message was sent, Bob would appear in the CIA executive suite with a copy

of the message for the personal inspection of the Director. Written on top of

each intercepted cable was a warning that the contents of the cable should be

kept especially confident because State was unaware that the CIA had a copy.

Despite Agency knowledge of all of Meyer's instructions and information,

Meyer and State's director of Iranian Affairs in Washington refused to yield

to Agency pressure for a quick settlement. Even after these two men met at

CIA headquarters with the Deputy Director of CIA, Vice Admiral Rufus Taylor,

they still insisted that the Agency's plans for the new installation were

unacceptable to the U.S. government as a whole. CIA Director Helms was so

aggravated by this continued resistance that he personally telephoned Secretary

of State Rusk to settle the matter. Rusk promptly ended the dispute by agreeing

completely to the CIA position.

Bob was also involved in another series of events which started when FI/D

o vi

worked out a liaison arrangement with the codebreaking service of a certain

South American government. This arrangement was ostensibly for the purpose of

allowing the CIA and the other country to cooperate in decoding messages sent

by third countries. However, FI/D tood advantage of the liaison to intercept

the secret communications of the host South American government. Such arrangements

were normal procedure to Bob. The intensely dedicated law and order advocate saw

nothing wrong in practicing this sort of duplicity on an allied government which

cooperated in good faith.

FI/D's liaison with the South American country continued for a long period

of time until relations between the United States and that nation soured over

unrelated issues, and as a result FI/D was forced to break off the relationship.

However, FI/D did not give up hope that the previous working arrangements could

be restored. 7

Sometime later, Bob suggested to an officer in the CIA's executive suite

that the Agency should help. the South American country obtain a channel in the

international satellite communications network, Comsat. Always the secretive

operator, Bob did not explain why the Agency should do this, and the other

CIA man replied that CIA, afterall, was not the American foreign aid program; and

wether or not this particular country received a Comsat channel did not seem to

be a matter concer. ing CIA. Only later did the executive suite officer learn

from other sources that FI/D had worked out a deal with the South American

country in which liaison would be restored in return for a Comsat channel (which

CIA would intercept). But Bob could not bring himself to share his scheme sten

with a fellow Agency employee in the Director's office.

Eventually, the South American country received the Comsat channel; the

country restored liaison with FI/D; and CIA again had access to all of that

country's secret messages.

Bob's job with FI/D is by no means one of the dirtiest jobs in the

Clandestine Services. There are operators in the paramilitary fields who

probably conceive and carry out more distasteful machinations. But Bob is in

a position where, on a regular basis, he misrepresents himself and even lies.

Transcript of the President's News Con

Following is a transcripi of Presi-

dent Carter's

news conference

Washington jesterday afternoon,

by

The

New: York

Times

through the jacilities of ABC News:

Opening Statement

Good afternoon everybody. I'd like

to make a very brief statement as a

progress report to the American people

of some items that are important to

us.

We have submitted and the Congress

is now considering legislation to give

me

the

authority

to

reorganize : the

executive branch of Government.

The

Senate Committee under Senator Ribic-

and they'll be marking up the

off has now completed their hear bil

beginning tomorrow.

The House Committee on Govern-

'ment Operations

under

Congressman

Jack Brooks has scheduled hearings to

begin on March 1.

So because of the interest of the

'American people and the Congress and

myself in completing this very crucial

project I think the Congress is moving

with great expedition to give me that

authority.

I We've also initiated with directions

i to the members of the Cabinet and

other agency heads a new program to

cut down on the extremely great over-

load of paper work with a requirement

that those

who

prepare

regulations

be

Government

responsible

for

the

preparation assigned

them. I've asked

my Cabinet officers to read the regula-

tions that are forthcoming from

their

departments each week until they see

the volume and the complexity of them,

and we hope to eliminate unnecessary

regulations,

abbreviate those that are

necessary and express them in a lan-

guage so that we can all understand

them.

I've

also asked major elements of

our own society, the university profes-

sors and the state officials in this last

week to give me their suggestions on

how the regulations might be improved

We have done the same thing with

reports required by the Federal Govern-

nient. I hope to reduce drastically the

number of reports and the frequency

of those reports and the complexity.

of them.

We will complete the proposed legis-

lation on creating

week. The

proposed

legislation is now on my desk. It will

be submitted to the Congress for action

the first of next week. And we've con-

sulted very closely with the key leaders

in the Congress and I believe there's

going to be a rapid creatina of this

new department. and a heavy emphasis

on the importance of energy questions.

to our people.

We will also present to the American

people probably at a joint session of

the Congress a speech by me about

April 20, a comprehensive energy poli-

cy which would involve all the com-

plexities of the energy question.

It's

something that's long overdue and it's

going to be quite profound in its impact

on the American consciousness and our

society, and I,hope it will be compre-

Questions and Answers

1 Defense Budget

Q. Mr. President, you told the Demo.

Platform. Committee that you

thought present defense expenditures

could be reduced 'by five to seven bil

lion dollars. Now I think you may have

modified your position somewhat since

then, Obviously in your short time in

defense spending will be. In the short

evolution of new weapons which in the

future can become enormously expen-

sive; a longer assignment of military

personnel to a base before they are

transferred; some emphasis on the cor

rection of inequities and unfairnesses

in the retirement system.

These things obviously can't be done

in three weeks, but they will be

an

ongoing effort on my part. And I think

the 1979 budget, which will be my Ad-

ministration's first budget, will

show

these improvements to a substantial de-

gree.

Q. Will next year's defense budget

actually be

lower

then than the one

that you just revised. A. I can't say

yet.

/ 2. C.L.A. Accountability

Q. Do you think it was proper for

the C.I.A. to pay off King Hussein and

other foreign leaders? And what steps

are you taking to make yourself more

knowledgeable

and more accountable

for what the C.I.A. does?

ph: A. Well, I've adopted a policy which

we might predicate a successful meet-

ing of a threat to us in time of war

a direct personal reponsibility for the

operation of all the ingelligence agen-

that they are meeting these standards.

3. Correcting Errors on C.I.A.

Q. It there has been erroneous infor-

mation, wouldn't it behoove you to cor-

rect the record?

A. In some ways we are correcting

the record, but if I began to either dis

pute or confirm every individual story

that's written whether correct or er-

roneous on every. matter

relating- to

the C.I.A., then these matters which

'are necessarily secret would no longer

be secret, so I'm not going to comment

on individual items that relate to intel-

ligence.

4. Difference With Meany

Q. Mr. President, George Meany says

he won't go along with your idea for

pre-notification on wage and price in-

creases. And my question really is, how

hard. are you going to press Mr. Meany

to go along and do you have anything

else in mind that you could use in the

way of Government involving itself to

try to control inflation?

A. I announced earlier my firm com

and price laws or authority, not to have

standby wage and price authority. I've

not made any proposal to Mr. Meany

Q. Mr. President, on that same sub-

of C.I.A. activities had found nothing

illegal or improper and you later said

that these activities are legitimate and

proper. Isn't that a value judgment that

is just a private citizen's opinion, he

would say that every President has had

arguments and debates and disagree-

ments. with the Congress. And I think

that's inevitable in our system of Gov-

ernment. That's part of the checks and

balances that's very precious to us all.

I have found up to now a growing

sense of cooperation with the Congress.

I think last week when I was asked

troubles were perhaps underestimated

by the news media. I think now per-

haps the troubles with the Congress

are overestimated. I have frequent

meetings with the Congressional lead-

legislation that we consider to be cru-

And I have to say in summary that

I am very pleased with my relationship

with the Congress now.

9. The Election Process

Q. Mr. President, in

view of your

assignment to Vice President Mondale

regarding the election laws, could you

give us your view, sir, on the direct

time, I want to increase the surety that

we have that the reserve supply data

I don't know whether we will decide:

to go on with it or not. And I doniti

know whether we'll expedite produce

tion of it or not, at this time.

Part of the factor to be assessed is.

the attitude of the Soviet Union. If wer

can have a general lessening of tension,,

a demonstrated commitment on their

part toward disarmament, it would cer-

tainly make it less likely that we would

go ahead with the B-I.

But I can't answer that question untir

I complete my own study, and I thinki

that would have to be terminated by:

others are accurate.

We are now conducting some admit-

tell Andrus in interior abd So tetay

be followed up by more detailed studies

under Dr. Schlesinger, to see whether

or not the reserve supplies are ade-

quate and whether or not the oil com-

panies are giving us accurate data. I

think it's obvious to all of us that there

are some instances where natural gas

withheld from the

understandable. If I was

oil company I would reserve the right

to release or to reserve some supplies

of natural gas.

With the emergency legislation that

the Congress did pass, I think in about

a week of assessment during the frigid

part of the winter-it's still very cold-

we were given some authority

at a very high price. This

is obviously a transcient circumstance.

But I believe the American people

will be willing to make the sacrifices

required, if they are convinced that fu-

ture reports will be accurate, that sup-

plies will not be withheld from the mar-

ket and if we can let the oil companies

know in a predictable way what our

policy will be two months or two years

or 20 years in the future-within the

bounds of human reason-then I think

they'll be much less likely to withhold

supplies of oil and natural. gas

future if the policies do change.

14. Rise in Gasoline Tax

Q. Another question, sir, on the sacri-

fices that you say your upcoming ener-

gy program is going to demand. Is it

likely

that one of those sacrifices. is

going to come in the form of a largely

increased Federal gasoline tax?

A. I don't know how to answer vour

18. Campaign Financing Law.;

Q. Mr. President, I was a little unclear

about what you're going to propose:

in the campaign finance law. Are you

saying that you will propose to have

all Congressional elections publicly fl

nanced? A. That's my preferenge, yes.

•Q. Is that what you will propose to

law package. And I'd like to reserve

my own judgment until I see what his

report is to me. But that's my own

inclination, It's a position that I took:

during the campaign and so far.I have

no reason to change my mind.

19. Foreign Policy Turntable

Q. You gave us a kind of a timetable*

for your domestic program in your pre-

liminary

statement.

wonder if

have a similar timetable of what you

hope to achieve in foreign

policy be-

tween now

and the end of the year,

such as Middle East peace, Cyprus, the

treaty with Panama.

A.

Of course I can't answer that

question specifically

because I don't

will get

from other nations and I don't know.

what the inclination of those

9. The Election Process

Q.

Mr. President, in view

of your

assignment to Vice President Mondale

regarding the election laws, could you

give us your view, sir, on the direct

clection"of a President versus the Elec-

toral College.

And also do you think

that the public financing should be ex

tended to Congress as well as the Presi-

dency?

A. There are

three

basic questions

that come up. In the first place, I do

/ favor

at least an automatic vote by

Presidential electors once the general

election is completed. I think the Elec

-toral Colllege,

for instance, should be

eliminated.

Whether

the ratio

among

states of votes ought to be changed

lime we have no direct relationships

comments are in public statements like

but we do have messages coming

back from people who visit Cuba.

11. Defense Savings Goal

Q. In answer to an

Mr. President, you said that you could-

whether next year's

budget will be lower or higher than

this year's. But as I understood your

earlier postion, you did want to achieve

is you know has been limited to about

that that's a goal that will be

governors of

itionally that you would work with

Congress to deregulate new natural

Q. Another question, sir, on the sacri-

fices that you say your upcoming ener-

y program is going to demand. Is It

ikely that one of those sacrifices 1s

zoing to come in the form ot a largely

increased Federal gasoline tax:

A. I don't know how to answer your

questions about specifics of the propos

al. I want to make this clear. The pur

pose of the

energy policy evolution

is not to cause

sacrifice of hardship

among the American people.Unless

can demonstrate that in balance the

temporary sacrifices in a certain area

are far overcome by immediate and ul-

timate benefits then nobody's going to

buy it.

And I believe that we've now got

such a horrible conglomeratlon iot con-

fusion in the energy field that nobody

goine to. herpen next.

So I think that the sacrifices will be

far overcome by the benefits that the

American people.ill be easily able to

discern for themsel. 's.

15. U.S. Rol: on Canada

Q. You said that in spite of the fact

that the. Canadian eople would have

to determine their future for them-

selves,

particularly in regard to the

separatism issue in Quebec that you

had confidence that the issue would

be straightened out relatively peaceful-

ly. Do you really think that there is

little concern in this country about the

future of a unified Canada and is there

anything really that we can do about

A. There's a great deal of concern

in this country

about the future of

Canada and I have complete confi-

dence, as I said in an interview with

the Canadian news media in the sound

judgment of the Canadian people.

I'm familiar and even more famillar

• today than I was two days ago after

Prime Minister Trudeau's visit-with

the problems in Quebec and the inclina-

tion of some of the French Canadians

to have an independent status from the

rest of Canadian Provinces.

I don't know what's going to be the

ultimate outcome. But I believe that

we are so closely tied together with

Canada on a mutually beneficial basis,

sharing problems, sharing opportuni-

ties, sharing trade, sharing manufactur

ing companies that have joint owner-

ship, our exchange of energy sources,

our sharing of the St. Lawrence Sea-

way, the Great Lakes as far as water

pollution is concerned, the bringing of

Alaskan oil and natural gas down to

us that we have got to have a continu-

•ing relationship with Canada.

My own personal preference would

be that the commonwealth stay as it

is and that there not be a separate

Quebec province. But that's a decision

for the Canadians to make and I would

certainly make no private or public

move to try to determine the outcome

of that great debate.

16. Keeping Campaign Promises

Q. Mr. President, you've had a month

now to enjoy the view from the Oval

Office. Do you think you'll be able to

keep fully all the campaign promises

A. As you know, we have issued what

I believe is the complete book of my

campaign promises, which is, I pre-

those promises.
