acquainted with Santos TRAFFICANTE. [extensive info. see

to remain in Cuba and was prepared to cooperate with the

Castro Government in order to continue business as usual.

One person in the G-2 most willing to become involved with

TRAFFICANTE waS Manuel PINEIRO, a high intelligence official.

PINEIRO's reasoning was that TRAFFICANTE and the Mafia had

collaborators in the U.S. Government and the FBI which could

be useful to support G2 operations in the Miami area.
