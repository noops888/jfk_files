((the Moldavian SSR)).
He was in Moldavia.

He was, ((wait)) one minute, SAVCHENKO was after BERIYA; SAVCHENKO
was at one time Deputy ((Minister)), here, after BERIYA, he was a

Deputy ((iiinister)) for us ((MVD)).
Wherey

In the HVD, in the MVD, the IVD, he was a Deputy ((inister)).

And, to my thinking, there even was some period, when SEROV came,

he was under SEROV, and then he removed him and he was for many
years, in recent years he has worked all of the time in Moldavia, as

Chairman of the KGB ((there)), yes.
You know this exactly:

Yes; that SAVCHENKO has been in Moldavia all these years,’ exactly.

This one; he is in Moldavia, until recently (do poslednego vreneni)

It is precisely this SAVCHENKO ((whom)) I have in mind.

I now am asking: Is there another SAVCHENKO there.

Have you ever heard of another Lt Gen (General-leytenant) SAVCHENKO?

All the trouble ((is)) in the following, you understand «= you

with regard....

(Cinterrupts)) SAVCHENKO -- that is the last nase (familiya), and

that is what I said.

Tae question is (stoit) in the following: that -- you see -- it is
hard to believe that a person -~ as they say -- who worked there 11
years eitier tries to say that he docs not know sonething or wants

to show that he knows.

No, what I know, I tell, only vhat-I know.
Between us, the SAVCHENKO who was in the Ukraine, in Intelligence
and so forth and so forth, Sergey Romanovich, everyone (vse sobaki)

in the shole world inows hin.

Well, tell ((me, if it is)) no secret.

Everyone also knows that SAVCHENXO whom you do not know — or wish
to say that you do not know — because his nane is everywhere in the
newspapers, without any cover; the questior is (stoit) in the
following: that, you understand, if you do not snow what happened
with the SAYCHENKO who was chief of Intelligence, etc., if you do
not know that it is precisely he in Moldavia, then please do not

say.

((Interrupts)) I am telling you what I know, as (kak) I know.

Why do you pose the question so.

I pose the question so, because there are two SAVCHENKOs, and

(Git was)) not that SAVCHENKO of whom you speak that was in Moldavia,
but quite another, and I want to pin dow (podvesti) here that you as
an employee of 11 years must know the other, who also is a lieutenant

general, ((and)) why you do not know hin.

— SEED

Taerefore, I am aszing you whether you have heard something interesting .

£ OO BOT KhOwW 6215.

I heard the last name (faniliya), and ((that is)) all.

A, If you have heard this last nane (familiya), then you must have

heacd the last nane (faniliya) of tnat one a hundred tines more.

B. Maybe I did hear ((it)), but I do not know.

Ian telling you that I do not know and that neitner one of (ni odin

iz) the SAVCHENKOs ever was my chief, ever.

A. He stood closer, closer to the Second Chief Directorate than this one.

B. Not one of ny, of these SAVCHE) was ny chicf.

My chief was FEDOTOV, SHUBNYAXOV, GRIDANOV; I an saying ((that))

these ((were)) the big chiefs.

A. I do not think that you are trying to understand ne well.

B, I am trying to understand you well.

How is this — I am not trying to understand you well:

It is in my interests (Eto v moixh interesakh).

A. J am trying to explain to you tnat if you, as an enployee who worked
({there)) for 11 years, know the SAVCHENKO who was in the Ukraine, i
who was chief of Intelligence, who then found hinself with neither
business nor position, what happened to him, then you natie him, j
((say)) that he ((is a)) Minister in Moldavia.

I am telling you oe and this (({is)) established by the facts, even

Soviet newspapers, including the names, etc. etc....

B. Of course.

Deputies are elected, there ((are)) Soviets (tam sovety)....

A. ...Another person, but not this person.
My question: What do you know happened to the SAYCHENKO who was

chief of Intelligence:



A.

I know, as I told you, that there was a SAVCHENKO... in the KGB,:.
the MVD, that there was 2 SAVCHENKO, the nane SAVCHENKO, General.
SAVCHENKO was chief of Intelligence and then SAVCHENKO, before this
SAVCHENKO, supposedly, was, well, a Hinister in the Uuraitie; that
this SAVCHENKO ((is)) Chairnan of the KGB in Moldavia.

That is all I know about SAVCHENKO.

Which SAVCHENKO: !

You made this cor-:lusion yourself, or you knew ((this)) when you

were working.

((interrupts)) Well, when I was working, I knew; here I heard a

little bit, here a little bit of something.

From where (1G).

Because each person, Soviet, who works in intelligence, in counter-
intelligence, especially in recent times, he knows the difference
exactly and he knows both SAVCHENKOs from top to bottom (kak

obluplennyye) .

I think not (Ya ne dumayu), because....

Both of them are lieutenant generals, both are lieutenant generals,
both are connected with intelligence and counterintelligence.

So, the question is (stoit): either you were there and must know ~
exactly, or you were not there and do not know.

I said what I know.

We will say this: that I am saying what I know....

Of course....

I certainly am not trying to contradict the facts, to tell-you

something superfluous or to ea ad out something unusual; I am saying

SEE

In fact, facts.

And I am telling you that I did ioe know this....

((XG - A and B speax at the sane tine))

..-To explain these facts articulately.

You may (mozhete) know millions of other things which I do not know.
But I know millions of things waich you do not ‘now,

Well, what do you want fron ne.

Tell ((mc)), please, that a person -~ if he had worked 11 years,

knows GOGLIDZE, MASLENNIKOV....

((interrupts)) I heard,

I do not know, I do not know, but I have heard the name.

... Must know SAVCHENXO, Ivan Tikhonovich, also.

Working in the Second Chief Directorate, even if you did not write
any kind of reports (( letters" - pis'ma)) to him, probably some
kind of papers (buaagi) came from him every week.

I do not want to tell you....

((interrupts)) ((I did not see any)) papers over SAVCHENKO's
signature (za podpis'yu SAVCHENKO).

If you did not see ((such papers)), then again there is (stoit) a
big question: were you there at this time:

The whole question lies in this. .

I am not trying to go into something deeply (zalazit’ kuda-to gluboko);

I simply am taking those persons and figues who are so outstanding
(xotoryye prosto s nog sshibatel'nyy) ((that)) one cannot be mis-

taken; a person who.



ough ((re are speaking)) Russian.

We are talking in two different languages.

You want me to understand, you want me to o hy the same nethod of
thought as jou do.

I cannot; I an going as I can.

Tnat which I have here ((B points ‘to his head)), that which I

renember, that which I know.

Let us return again to one snall question.

You affirned (utverzhdayete), only several minutes ago, ((that))
having gone to work in the NGB or the MVD in Harch 1953, you received
for some tice (nekotoroye vrenya) a basic pay (oklad) of 1,700 rubles,
plus, ((for)) rank -- 500 rubles.

I do not want to accuse you of lying or of lies or of something clse,
but all of this contradicts the facts.

In the KGB -— on, the MVD, at that time —~ they already were not
receiving ((pay)) for rank in March, and therefore you could not have

received money ((ikh: den'gi)) for rank when you started work (postupil:

I know taat they did not receive ((pay)) for rank for a year (v
techeniye goda) and ((then)) they began to receive ((Pay)) for rank
again, and ((that is)) all.

When, what dates, I do not remember.

Understand ((me)); this is no explanation: "When, what dates, I do.

not remember...."

((Angrily)) But I cannot give you ((the dates)).
And if I do not know, I do not know, I do not know.

Nowyou have said that you do not know.

Five minutes ago....

hl

((interrupts)) I said that they gave ((pay)) for rank, then they

stopped giving ((pay)) for mnk, and then again it was returned {|

(vernulos') anew.

|
|



‘See H Rie -YeCe VEE {pay) )-for- rank; because “at "thin~-time-they ad:

pores, -

were not paying ((for rank)). fe

They already were not paying.

Well, then, they did not pay for a year, and then they began again

to pay for rank.

You told me that you received 1,700 ((rubles)), plus 500 for rank.

I asked you three times: “Are you certain."

Yes.

Exactly.

Of course, I am certain... later ((they began to give)) me again

1,700 and 500..

We are not talking of later, now.

I am saying that in March you began work and you told me that your
Sirst pay was, as a case officer, 1,700, plus 500, for rank.

In March and April, etc. -- I do not want to say until when —~ they

were not paying ((for rank)).

. But how strange you are (No, kakoy zhe Vy strannyy)!

But I do not want to deceive you -~ I received ((pay)) for rank,

they receive 1,700 for position (za dolzhnost') and 500 for rank;
((wait)) one minute; I an not deceiving you, 1,700 for rank as a

ease officer, that is, 1,700 for position, basic pay; 500 == ((for))
rank (pogony). :
For a period of about a year I did not receive this 500 for rank;

I received only the 1,700 plus longevity pay (vysluzhnyye) -- this
longevity (vysluzhnyye) ((pay)), secrecy ((pay)), and so forth.

I have no intention of deceiving you.

We were saying that you started (postupili) in March and immediately
they paid you 1,700; I am not posing a question about this money; £

1,700 rubles was the basic pay of a case officer. a :

SRE



pee

It was and is.

True.
It was; and, at one time, they were paying gor ran‘:.
They paid a lieutenant 500; everyone knows this; and ((taecy did so))

in the Aray, also.

For a senior ((licutenant)), 600.

This ((was)) usual (Eto «:

yenno), yes, yes.

But the question is (stoit) ((in that)): they already “ere not

paying ((for rank)) in March.

But, yon see, you... such hooks you put out (takiye hryuchoki stavite).
This is not a hook....

((interrupts)) It is a hook.

...It is a fact which, you understand, you could in no way get around.
But the important fact is ((only)) in that they did not pay me for
rank for a year and ((then)) again ((paid me)) 1,700, 500 and
longevity pay (vysluzhnyye).

Well, but when, what, well, I do not remember.

In any case, a person —~ if he really came from the Navy, where he

received....
((interrupts)) there, for rank, yes....
..-And now he had come here, perhaps his ((pay)) for position ((is))

higher, but he will remember very well ((that)) they do not pay hin

for rank.

A.

you nor your colleagues before-you, here are questions

sonchow ((are)) not what you vant, to se such questions....
((XG - A and B speak at the sane tine))

_..Well, I did not even pay attention to money.

You asked ne —- ((wait)) one minute, excuse me -- you asked ne: but
you asked ne how nuch is (budet) the tasic pay (okLad)

I said: no.

Yay.
I did not as nore.

No, ((wait)) one minute, buy why

And do you i:now why.

Because at that time it was not (ne stoyal) a question of money.

At that tine, it was not important (( did not play a role" - roli ne

igral)) for me.

I certainly an not posing a question about money.
Whether it was or was not important.

I asked you two or three times and you repeated.

1,700, 500, plus ((pay for)) secrecy, there, etc,

If you began (postupili) in March you could not have received (€pay))

for rank.

Well, then... well, if they were not giving it from the time (s
momenta) of STALIN's death, then I began to receive ({it)) after a_
year.

For a year they did not pay it.

1,700, 500 and ((pay for)) secrecy, longevity.

Let us say so!

Yes, and I ((am trying)) to say only the. truth (eye).

Well, I am trying.

It does not turn out that way; they stopped payinz not only after i
STALIN, but at some other tine.
You, having -.orked there, must know this.

One can in no way disregard this.

I certainly do not deny the fact, we will not speak with exactitude

(tochno), ((of)) how much they were paying and to whom for secrecy,
for language, for longevity, etc.

It is not so important; a person can forget, ((whether)) they paid
him 10 or 15% and some kind of increment (nadbavka) for language,

for secrecy or for longevity, etc.; but when they took away ((the

For the officer it was very sensitive and very important....

((XG - A and B speak at the same time))

For you, this, you say that this had no significance; 0,K., so;

but for the ordinary mortal officer, you know, if a person is a H {

colonel, this right away....
1,300....
«+. 1,300 rubles.

Of course; with longevity ((pay)) (s vysluzhnymi)....

—SECRET—————



...Tais then runs to 1,600... well, 1,600.

Tnerefore, for ({tais)) one reason only, I have posed this question.

I do not remember when.

I tell you that they paid ne 1,700 as a case officer, 500 -~ for
rank.

Was it a year.

In the beginning, a year, whether at the end of 1953 or the beginning
of 1954, but perhaps you are right, fron the beginning of 1953,
right from the zonent, for approxinatcly a year they were not paying
for rank.

Then again they began to pay for rank. ((Pauses))

Look, you are building on this sone kind of (1G) that I did not
exactly say this, this.

Well, you see, they do not forget such things...

In this question ((there is)) no exactness, because I am trying to
get at only the fact itself: you said that when you went to work
you received ((pay)) for rank, but at this time they were not paying
((for rank)).

I can in no way understand how you could have received ((it)).

That is my question (Vot moy vopros).

I think that this, such a simple...

For a year (Na protyazhenii goda) I did not receive ((pay)) for rank
((Laugas)); the rest ((of the time)), I received ((it)).

When did I not receive ((it))?

I do not remember.

But all ((personnel)) did not receive ((it)), not only I.
The same question.

Of course, in common life ((and)) work, perhaps it is not so
important about SAYCHENKO.

—



for you -- cho, as is said, #8rked there —~ ((to know that there are)

two SAVCHENXOs is the sane, everyone knows, it is the same as knowing

GRIDANOY -- the sane, the sanc.

(Cin a low voice)) No.

Absolutely the sane.

((In a low voice)) No.

And you, when you are. talking about one and you make a mistake -- let
us say, you nistake the name and so forth, you do not know another,
but you do not know another ~- it is in mo way possible to believe
that a person who had worked ((there)) 11 years would not know,
because he also ((i.e., the other SAVCHENKO)) is a licutenant general
and a big wheel (bol'shaya shishka).

One can in no way disregard ((this)).

Excuse me; may I tell you one thing: I began to work, I came as

a case officer, I worked (rabotayu) as a case officer in 1953, 1954,
1955, 1956, and -- excuse me for the vulgar expression -- I needed
to know SAVCHENKO, Marshal TIMOSHENKO and someone ((else, like them))
as I needed to know my ass (mne do zhopy bylo SAVCHENKO...) ((1.e.,
it was absolutely unnecessary)).

For me, I came, I began (nachinayu) to work. ae iH
Later, later, I became deputy chief of a section (otdeleniye); when
(@)); from 1958, it was important for me here to whom, in what
name, to write a paper (bumagu pisat'), to whom, something-else.

But working as a rank and file employee, for me it was, ah....

I agree. -

That you had no great interest....

Yes, arid not only ((no great)) interest; even....

fell, it was remote (nedosyagayemo).

SRE

UHR ret etnies ne

Inaccessible (nedosyagayemo)

The problen is in that he of whom you are speaking is not ((there)),
but the one (tot) who is working there 25 years and who is there
today you do not know.

This is the problem (Vot v chem vopros).

You understand,

Pecause if you were vorking there, you would tell ne now ctly
what the second SAVCHENXO did and, immediately, the difference

between then, because everyone (kazhdaya sobaka) knows.

I know one SAVCHENKO, to ny thinking, this is ((the only)) one,
perhaps, perhaps I am mistaken here ((when)) I give you the positions

(dolzhnosti) in which both worked, perhaps.

((in English)) No, no.

They both were working all of the time in different ((positions))
and ((in English)) no connections.

Of course, by way of work there were ((in English)) connections,

but this SAVCHENKO of whom I am speaking had, had nore business with
the Second Chief Directorate than with the First.

We will return to this in due time.

Good.

As you wish. oe
I want, I want now (kak raz)....

((interrupts)) I did not write to anyone, I did not read papers
over the signature of SAVCHENKO....

About the Moldavian.

About the Moldavian, of whom I am speaking, but not that one of whon

And therefore it is rather difficult to say ((vhether he is)) in

For a year (V techeniye coda) they were not giving ((pay)) for rank.
Which:

About, it seems to me, I think, ‘59, at the end of 1953, the
bepinning of 1954, they were not giving ((pay)) for rank.

But, again, I do not remember.

In my opinion, so, in my opinion, you know exactly when they were
not giving ((pay for rank)).

It is not possible to do this in the Army.

Not possible.

And there were persistent rumors that they again would take away

((the pay)) for rank. i
A, How did they answer FURTSEVA on this.

B, I simply an saying that this was FURTSEVA's suggestion, when she

was a member of the Presidium.

A. What -= was she responsible (otvechala) for the work of the KGB or

the Army as a nember of the Presidium:

B. No.
As a member of the Presidium, in all probability a question was
posed (stoyal vopros) in the Presidium about the economy of resources,
about finding additional (dopolnitel'nyye) money, Somewhere, sonehow,
and they resolved the question, the problem was resolved; in part
she suggested, as one of the forms, cutting this money.
The Army ((is)) huge, has nany people (mnogochislennaya) .
1f ((pay)) for rank ((were)) cut, then huge anounts of money
(ogronnyye den'gi) ((would)) be received.

question, ((sayinz)) that one cannot in any case take away ((pay for

Because in the Arny the pay rates for officers ((are)) not larze,

having in mind company commanders, ctc.

Speaking to the point, when you were working in... in the Baltic
Fleet or where you were -~ in the GRU, you say -= how nuch were you
paid (skol'o Van platili)

What was the basic pay (o'lad).

I began as an interpreter-translator (perevodchix), my position
(dolzhnost') was -~ interpreter-translator of Intelligence (ra:vedsi)

of the Seventh Naval Fleet.
Where ((was)) this Seventh Fleet.

It was in the Pacific Ocean, two fleets: the Fifth and the Seventh.

At that time, there were two fleets.

Interpreter-translator of the Seventh....

Interpreter-translator of Intelligence of the Seventh Naval Fleet.

And how nuch were you paid:

At that tine (Togda):

((After a long pause, B speaks, with uncertainty)) The basic pay

for the position (Dolzhnostnoy oklad) was, as an interpreter-

translator, it seems, 1,200 ((rubles)), plus -- I began ((as)) a

junior lieutenant -- 400; now, all of this has been doubled.
1,200 and 400, this is 1,600, and....

you know, there is a finance cortificate (denernnyy attestat), a
clothing and equipnent supply (veshchevoy) certificate, a rations

had (vse ne imeli) ((these certificates)), ((excepting)) only a few

for us still (i nam yeshche)....

Tnais is considered a remote area (otdalennoye mesto), plus ((there

we did not take the additional rations, but received more money.

In general, a large sum was accumulated (nabegala).

Because this ((was)) double ((pay)).

Well, this was in the Far East, but how much did you receive in

the Baltic.

I worked in the Baltic ((Fleet, area)) a few (neskol'ko) months,
here I already, when I arrived in the Baltic in. 1952, to me there,
there they made me ((a)) senior interpreter-translator of the MAS MRP,
of Intelligence of the Fourth Naval Fleet in the Baltic; again,
there were two fleets: the Second and the Fourth.

And ((that {s)) all.

There was no double ((nay)).

But here, a few (neskol'ko) months, until the end of 1352.

Well, anyway, for you... it was a great blow ((to lose the pay))
by ranks, there was much talk about this, and so forth, and I would
try or wish that you would recall, anyway, when they cut off ((the

pay)) for ranks.

I do not remember; I do not renenber,
For a year they did not pay, or ny work, inthe beginning of ny work

in the iiVD, they did not pay for ranks for a year.
Well, in the beginning of your work, as you said....

((interrupts)) Well, the beginning of my work, this ((was in))
1953-54, this ((was the)) beginning....

In ny imagination, that they cut this off, to my thinking... ((B
speaks with uncertainty)) at the end of 1953.

But I do not remember exactly.

Tney did not pay for ranks and....

This ((is)) a very important moment, and inagination, this is one
thing, but the facts, another thing.

It does not matter how you turn and twist, if you say that in March
they appointed you as a case officer and paid 1,700 ((rubles)) and,
for rank, 500, when in fact they were not paying ((for rank then)).
How can you make things connect up (('join ends' - svesti kontsy s

kontsami)) here;

But there is nothing difficult here ({about this)).

They did not pay me ((for rank)) for a year; I do not remember the
period exactly.

Whether it was the end of 1953 or the beginning of 1953, from the

beginning of my work, for a year I did not receive ((pay)) for rank —

Well, then, you already were working; by whose order and how was it

!

established (ustanovleno) to pay for ranks again; when was this
Taey did not pay anyone (vsem) ((for rank)) for exactly a year; ((that

is)) all.

Alright; you do not remember when they cut off the pay ((for rank));

perhaps you remember when they restored ((it)).

It scems to me that they restored ({it)) at the end of 1954.
It seems ((so)) to me, but again I cannot say exactly.

In my imagination, they returned ((it)) at the end of 1934.
What -~ and they paid the back~pay (zaplatili za vse staroye);

No, no, no, no; not a kopeck; nothing.

They simply began again.

Well, here again, I wish to repeat «= do you consider it possible :
to believe a persen who worked (({there)) for 11 years, etc., ((and))

who does not remember exactly and docs not know or does not want to tel?
such a fact, very important in the life of all officers, ((as)) when

they took away and when they restored ((the pay for rank)); how must

But here, here ((is)) the Gastronom, here ((is)) the sign,

Let us imagine that you, you understand... saen did they open the

Gastronoa there

The nane (nazvaniye): Gastronoa 40th ((i.e., Gastronon No. 40))...

when did they open...:

((wnen)) I began work, the Gastronon already was ((there)).

Well, when, approximately

In 1953, there already was a Gastronom ((there)).

((in English)) Well.

You see, of course, we can go on like this endlessly, etc: neither

in 1953 nor in 1954 was a Gastronoa there.

And there was no reform (I ne bylo reform).

‘There was no what (Ne bylo, chto).

There was none before 1953.

Well, when ((did they open the Gastronom)):

It was not in 1953 or 1954.

I do not know, I do not know.

Well, 1f you were there in 1953-34, as you say, and you tell me that
the Gastrozoa was there, I can.in no way buy this, well, I cannot in

any way, because....
((xG; B interrupts))

...Well, alright.
In ny imagination, tae Gastronon ((was there}) from 1953 as far as
I remember.

((Quaughs nervously, unhappily))

I again want to say, simply in comradely fashion, that imagination,

this is one thing, but the fact -~ completely another thing.

You may know ((some)) facts, but I may not know ((these same)) facts.

I may know facts, but you may not know a number (ryad) of facts.

A person who worked ((there)) 11 years must, and probably does, know
when they opened the Gastronom there and must also know what was

there before the Gastronon.
{((After two minutes' silence:)) I do not know.

Here again ((is)) a question.

It is, of course, difficult for me, and for all of my colleagues who
were here before this, to believe that-you were there, from 1953
until ((your)) last day, im the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB.
Because you even do not know the simplest thing: the building next

I even do not ask ((which)) uonth, but simply the year, the year:

I do not know.
I was not interested, I do not know, such a question did not cone
up (ne stavil takogo voprosa)....

In ny imagination, it was ((there)).

Therefore, of course, however you may try to put your case nore or
less in order, etc., it is hard, it is in no way possible to sew it

up (ni kak ne vozmozhno podshit').

But ((it is)) very sad.

((it is)) very sad that this is so.

And one cannot believe that you, for example, you insist that
“Twas ((there))", "I know ((this))."

((ven)) if it was not ((so)) with someone else (s kem), it was
((Go)) with ne.

It turns out so: 2 thousand soldiers are out of step, and (Conly))

one is in step.

I do not insist (utverzhdayu) ((that)) this ((is so)).
I know that you do not insist....

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

I answer you what was ((or, "that it was" ~ chto bylo)) there.
God knows!

If I began to visit (poseshchat')..Building 12, then I visited -
Building 12, then from the very beginning of my life (s samogo
nachala moyey zhizni), 1953, from the very beginning, 1953, I went
to Personnel (kadry) these 2-3 times, then I began to work.

These ((are)) all of the entrances which I visited for approximately

Let us return again to the question:
Here ((is)) the door to the Club of the GB.

What ((is)) written there or was written...

Nothing.

Well, nothing ((is)) written on these doors.

There are a few (neskol'ko) doors, you reacuber.

Building 12 or in Building 2, this ((is)) not the usual entrance i

This ((is)), a few glass doors, a few.

You go in one (Vkhodite Vy v odnu).

a third.

you go through the next entrance (vkaod) and there already you show...

there may be signs inside, in this

where (suda).

but, you do not remember, fron the nosent ((of the beginning)) of
your wors there, how long the sign (vyveska) -- "Club of Employees
of the {inistry for State Security USSR (Klub Sotrudnikov Ministerstva

Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti SSS)" -- hung ((there)).
And... I did not see this sign, I did not see ((it)).

Too bad (Ochen' zhal'), too Lad.

Let us return again to one question:

As you said, and this also is known to all, in March, after STALIN's
death, the MVD and the UGB combined (ob"yedinili vmeste), and BERIYA
became the Minister of Internal Affairs; KOBULOV was his First
Deputy.

What club did the MVD employees use after they joined (kogda oni

soyedinilis' s) the MGB’

The thing is that on Dzerzhinskiy Street, if you go just a little

further along there, ((there is)) the Club of the KGB -- that which

is there now -- on the right side, but ((if)) you go further along

Dzerzhinskiy Street, on the left side, on the left side, where at
one time there ws a store, the so-called “Arrow (Strela)" or

something in that vein, closed, there was the club of the MVD.
What happened to it:

It also remained in the system es a club after 1953-54, because

I remenber that KLYUCHAREV, an employee of the First Department
(Otdel), died in 1953 and there was a question (vopros stoyal) of
whether to show the coffin with his body in this Club of the KGB ==



cee ene an i BE.

je presen
Because it was necessary to find a place (pomeshctieniye), they
wanted to use either this or this building.

And I wanted to say ((that)) they used both clubs.

What is there in this building at present
On the day you were there for the last tine in Moscow, or the last

2-3 years.

There is no club as such there now.

It is further along the street, where the forner “Arrow ((store

organization (stroitel'noye knozyaystvo) from the "nOZU (( House~

a construction, well... section (otdeleniye) or cepartnent (otdel)
or something, the devil knows, but something is there (no chto-to

That is ((to say, then)), the buildiug as such continues to belong

to the KGB, not the MVD.

Let us return, further, to our outual friend, ROZHENKO.
Earlier, you said that you conpleted (zapolnyali) a questionnaire
(anketa) and an autobiography for his section (otdeleniye), for

him and for his employee.

What other steps (Chto yeshche... predprinimalo) did the MVD or the |

MGB =~ call it whatever you wish -- take in order to accept you.

I absolutely do not know what they did (prinimali); I absolutely

do not know, because there were only these 2-3 conversations with

me and I 100% cannot tell you.

I cannot tell you; I filled out the questionnaire (anketa) for
ROZHENKO and for his man, for his case officer who talked with me,

or ((it happened that)) when I had just started work, SAXHAROV, the
Personnel man (kadrovik) of the Second Chief (Kirectorate), gave. ~=.
me two questionnaires, two autobiographies to fill out.

I cannot say exactly.

But do you reseaber the name of the Chief of the Personnel Section
(Otdeleniye Kadrov) of the Sccond Chief Directorate at that tine or

later

Taere was none (Ne bylo), there vas none.
There was one Personnel nan in the Second Chief Directorate.
((vaere vas)) not a Personnel group (srupsa), there wis nothing.

One Personnel nan ~— SAXHAROV, Nikolay Grigor 'yevich,
Are you sure of this.

Ho, ho; not just certain --- we vere on the same floor (my sideli na
odnom etazhe).
And his office was here, literally ((just)) a few steps from the

First Department (Otdel).

But who vas responsible for (zanimalsya) personnel of the Surveillance
Department (Otdel Naruzhnogo Nablyudeniya) of the Second Chief

Directorate at that tine

UODK:

VODK... Central Personnel (Tsentral'ayye Kadry).

((Wait)) one minute, UODK, they also had, like the Second Chief
((@irectorate)) had its own Personnel man in the system.

Not in Personnel, but, like the Second Chief ((@irectorate)), they ae
had = I think -- their ((own Personnel)) Department (Otdel).

But what -- you do not know more exactly’
You worked so many years there, you must probably know.
‘That is how it is, to speak in a comradely way (Vot tak, po-tovarishch-

eski).

But I am answering you.
In a comradely way.

I am answering you, as I remember ((it)), as I know ((it)).



you do not know who headed (zavedoval) Personnel and who headed

(vedal) Surveillance,

B. One winute, oa
How ((was)) it, who headed ((them)) i

Surveillance, in my tine, as soon as I had begun to-work, the UODK, i

the Directorate for the Protection of the Diplomatic Corps (Upravleniye
khrany Diplomaticheskojo Xorpusa), surveillance of foreigners
(slezhka 2a inostrantsami) was under (byla podchinena) the Second $
Chief Directorate, under (vo slave s) BOVKO ((or, — DOYKOY.)), :
Nikolay Vasil'yevich, who also was (yavlyalsya) Chief of the UODK and

he was a Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate.

But neither he nor someone from his, so to say, staff (shtab) was

(ne sidel) in Building 2 (v zdannii Doma 2).

A. Do you know something about their safe apartments (konspirativnaya

kvartira), where the Surveillance employees lived, where they went

to work in the morning, from which they moved about, etc., etc., in tha
period, the period of the beginning of your work in the Second
Chief Directorate -- ((I ask)) because there were so many of them

in Moscow (ikh v Hoskve do chertovoy materi).

B. P-s-s ((An explosive sigh, through nearly closed lips))

A, Well, nane for me a few safe apartments where they dé’not take agents,

but it is called a safe apartment where employees come in the

morning, from which they move about at work, ((and to which)) they

then cone back after work.

B. Y have given the whole plan (skhema vsya) for (po) the First

A. I am interested... I have seen this whole plan;
((In English)) It's alright; we still will come back te this plan
if it is (budet) necessary. :

eeenee een AOS,

worked so long, and so fort!

You nust know nany of then.

‘ane a few for me.

((Long pause)) I cannot tell you the main (osnovnaya) safe
apartment, the surveillance base (baza slezhki) of the First
Department (Otdel), of the former UCD, in 1953-54 I ((He laurhs))

do not reneaber, I was not even here.

In 1955, I was not even with thea (u nikh) at these bases.

vo you: imagine that a person wio has worked as a case officer and
higher in the Second Chief Directorate, connected with operational
matters, either finishes off ((aaintains, “sews up" — podshivayet))

files (papki) or something, but a person sits rear him, who mects

agents, conducts surveillance, requires it, writes assignnents, etc..

So,

... And in the course of three years you did not once hear and see

and you do not know anything about these safe apartments
Well, why do you put the question thus.

Because you have answered thus.

Otherwise, I cannot put ((the question so)).

You have said that in this time you were not working there and you
do not know.

In another instance, this morning or at the beginning of our con-
versation, you tried to convince me that (chto u...)...

"J heard one thing there, there a thing,’ but in the end I cannot
confirm how this happened.

I am saying that this thing also could have been heard; true’

—— SRE



in this Surveillance Department or in the Directorate for Affairs

(Po Delam) of the Diplomatic Corps, etc., I am not putting a question
to you of all the details of this, I sinply am asking where were
the safe apartnents of the Sccond Chief Directorate, where all of

their surveillants were (vsya ixh naruzhka sidela).

UODN, all of the UODX was (sidelo), all tue chiefs of departments : .
and the department (otdel) were in the area (v rayone) of either

Second or Third Meshchanskaya ((Street)), in 1953-54, when BOYKO

headed, well, surveillance (slezhka) of foreigners.

Vell, I never went there.

How does tae work with this surveillance usually shape up.

Let vs suppose, (1G) worker (rabotnik), I am running (vot ya vedu)

I unve a fewcases, I write out an assignzent for surveillance

(slezhka); the chief of the section (otdeleniye) signs, the chief

of the department (otdel) signs, with regard to foreigners.

And it goes by its om route (svoim kanaloa)....

We will return to this.

I understand how, by what route it goes, etc. :
I have, as taey say, the most routine, the most trifling, question, i
which an employee who worked there must know. i
Nane for me a few of the safe apartments where employees of ((the
department of)) Surveillance of the Second Chief Directorate had

their headquarters apartments (shtab-kvartira). iss ean

To which they go in the morning and from which they move about at

work and ((to which)) they return.

Do they not go to Building 2:

No.

They. i
Bach division (otdel) has its ((own)) base, its ((own)) base.

I do not know the base 1953, 1954, 1955, where the base of the

First Department (Otdel) was. :

eet

The main (osnovnaya) base from which they moved about.

A. It ds difficult, of course, to helieve, espectally for ne, that a |

person wao has worked there, etc,, does not now such a sinple thing.

B. How ((is)) this, he doesmt remember such a thing.

Simple.

A, Well, name these safe apartients.

Even one, two.

B. Well, Vosstaniye Square (ploshchad’ Vosstaniya), Vosstaniye Square
I told of (daval) ((earlier)); now it has been made sceret
(zakonspirirovana) ((B apparently said this in error and then
corrected himself:))... put aside (zakonservirovana), ((the safe

apartaent)) on Vosstaniye Square.

A. Good; Vosstaniye Square, then (yeshche).

B. ‘Then (Zatem); but ths, not, this... when they move about to their,

so to speak, places; then, in the area of Kropotkinskaya, near the

bridge, please, well, ((there are)) the surveillance points

Well, here, across Vosstaniye Square -- this ((is)) a tall pbuilding,
so, here -~ between Gertsen and Vorovsxiy; here is a small, such a,
you know, a little building (domishko), and here in this little
building ((is)) a taxi stand; so, here, on the first floor, there
was a safe apartment, it is now, but it has been put aside

Of course, it is very hard for me to believe that you worked there

for such a long tine and could not even notice taat a sign hung at i

the Club.

No, no, no.

Perhaps there was a sign before my tine, but I ¢o not rezenver a

sign; no.

or, for example, the fact: everyone knows that ((there is)) a
Gastronom there now, but there was no Gastronon ((there)) either
in 1953 or 1954.

Well, maybe not in 1954, perhaps the Gastronon vas made in 1955.

((Possibly, XG; A and B speak at the same time.))

...And you cannot say. ;

How many times were you personally in this Gastronon,

Again, it is hard to say how many times, I was ((there))....

I cannot tell you.

...Did you drop in either every day or every other day’

Well, no, no....

Once a month, or once a year.

I think this is not hard ((to answer))....

Perhaps... once (1G).

3..Because if you were working there, you are working, etc., well,

did you not have to buy all the groceries (produkt) there, and so.-

eg eacacede pw

forth:



For sone reason or other....
What cas the talk in the KGB.

Is it a good neighborhood.

(Cis it good)) That a Gastronon is located there

Can everyone drop in at the Gastronon

Of course, the neighborhood ((is)) not very .zo0d ((i.e., it is not

good that the Gastronon is there)).

Because, for example, 2 person drops in; ne can stand there, inside
the big windows, carry on a surveillance, ((secing)) who... who
enters, wao leaves.

Waat did the employees -- for example, your Counterintellisence

friends «- say of such a neighborhood.

((¥as)) it good for the KGS, bad for the KGS.

Bad, of course, for the XGB.

Did anyone say this.
At a conference, at a neeting.
Or soncvhere ((else)).

That “we do not need such a neighborhood -

1 do not remember that, I would have heard some such thing at a

conference and somewhere ((else)) there...

Well, since.

((interrupts, speaking loudly)) Well, there was talk that this

((is)) not much of a place (nevazhnoye... mesto) for the Gastronom.

Probably there was talk: someone decided to open the Gastronom there.

Well, this was decided in the Mossovet ((Gloscow Soviet — Moskovskiy

You were vorking there; perhaps you heard something, on the basis

of which....

I do not xnow.
I do not xnow how it was decided.
But I as telling you that ((it was)) the opinion of the operational

employees that tais, of course, ((is)) not much of a neighborhood.

Very much so.

It even could happen that, while all Soviet citizens are going

there, foreigners also can drop in.

Of course.

And the tourists and so forth, well, perhaps ((persons)) fron the

American Embassy will not ((i.e., will they not)) begin to go there

every cay....

They will notice ((them)).

They will notice them, yes.

But, of the others--perhaps a persona simply is going ((along)) and
sees (i vot uvidel) the Gastronon, runs in (zaskochil) for a
minute, etc.

Of course, it is hard -- again, I repeat my earlier words: as you
wish, whether you like it or not, it is of course hard to believe
that you would work ((there)) so much time and would not know when

they opened the Gastronon.

1 do not remember when they opened ((it)).

Or, for example, you cannot say more or less exactly how often you

dropped in there or ((if)) you never were there. —

It is difficult to say....

((%G; A and B talk at the same time))
... You never dropped in there (... Nixogda tuda ne zakhodili).

Well, no, without doubt (bezuslovno) I dropped in, I thing (po-

moyenu), sonetimes I even cropped in after work to do some shopping.

((This is)) for me also not understandzble.

You understand, of course, that when ABAKUMOV was ((there)),
IGNAT'YEV was ((there)), and so forth, KOSULOY of course was not in
power (ne u vlasti byl) in the NGZ or the MVD, he was working in
GUSINZ.

(Yes, but: )

I am saying ((that)) when....

(:KOBULOV?) was working with ABAKUMOV, he was working, KOBULOV
When:

Well... after the war... in these years.

If he was an acquaintance (znakomyy) of your family, do you know

approximately when he went to work in GUSIMZ:
No, no; I do not know exactly when he went to work in GUSIUZ.

And ((on)) what basis they took him and transferred him there, to
GUSIUZ:

In connection with “Bisnuth", so-called, the uranium mines

Tais ({is)) understandabic.

Who was he there, Chief or Deputy

Deputy Chief of GUSINZ,

But who was the Chief; do you not know.

There were a few of then; there was SERGEYEV at one time, who

worked as Deputy, was Chief, there was someone else there, a few

tines....

It is a little hard for me to believe that, for example, as far as

+I know, XODULOV was working in GUSINZ, he began approximately in

1947 or perhaps from the beginning of 1943; he did not have, then,
any relation to the Ministry for State Security where ABAXUMOV was
Minister, and... that KODULOV would phone the HGB and recommend you
for work.

He must have, probably, ((connections with)) some big man who (2G)....

You are forgetting about another ((thing)).

Excuse me, ((but)) you are forgetting another thing there ~~ that
GUSIMZ ((was)) a cover (krysha) for KOBULOV.

Because, in such an enterprise as "Bismuth", the people working there

were only fron the MGB.

I had served... in... in... the Navy.

Well, probably they asxed.

But I did not go through the Commission.

You know, if you worked there long.

around then (chto-to v eton rode).

Twice a week.

Once a year.

Where do they hold these shoots:

((Pauses)) There is a firing range in Building 12, in the basement,

and there were shoots also, I remember, in the beginning of 1954-55,
in the basement ((of the building)) on Markhlevskiy Street.

B,

Chief Directorate’

I think I received ((it)) in 1953.
How, under what circumstances, and where

((ifter a long pause, & speaks, with uncertainty);... The weapon,

the weapon, where did I receive the weapon

I received the weapon on ((@zerzhinskiy)) street, here on Dzerzninskiy
Street.

Approxinately, approximately, opposite iisel'nyy Street (pereulok).
Also, such a run-cown Little building.

On the outside there is no identification (Vnesane ni ciiem ne
ob"yasnish’), no sign of any kind, nothing....

A small building of two or three stories; I was there...-

I received a weapon; someone else of the boys fron the departnent

(otdel) received a weapon.
What was needed in order to receive a weapon.

((Pauses)) To my thinking, we received ((something)), as... @
receipt for forwarding (dlya napravieniya)... to... well... to this

section (otdeleniye), from our supply man (khozyaystvennik), SAMARIN.
You remember what kind ((of weapon)) they gave you?

1 will tell you now... to my thinking, I had... the last time, this. --
((2G; B speaks very softly; then, a long pause))

..-It seems I had a Walther Number 2... yes, in the beginning, a
Walther Number 2.

Then it was changed.

No, a “TI, a “TI. t
And the Walther I had was mine (A Val'ter eto u menya byl lichnyy)...

A "TT"... correct.



Yes; a big one (zdorovyy).

Did they give cartridges for it
Two clips (oboyna).
Could you taxe it home.

No... a weapon... the idea is that we nust keep ((it)) in a safe.
It was this way in the beginning.

They kept the weapon in the safe.

Then, they thought it up; they save the weapons over to ((the xeeping
of)) tne duty officer (dezhurnyy).

There was a roon where tney put (xuda sdavali) all the weapons hy
departments (po otdelam).

One fellow of sone sort ((was)) responsible for the weapons.

He issued it, received it, when it was needed for firing, for the
range; they cleaned it.

(2G) then, in the safe; then back; this rooa was eliminated, along
with the duty officer, and again they issued ((them)) and kept ((thea))
in the safes.

Now, for example, in recent years, they laid in the safes until 1953.
In 1933, again ((they were stored)) by departments and even fron
each section (otdeleniye); there was a single responsible person
in the department and he collected, he collects the weapons for all
sections, he gives you a little receipt-coupon (talonchik); you
have a receipt-coupon which ((indicates that)) we are holding ({the
weapon)) in the safe, such a little yellow ((receipt-coupon)).
Because your number is shown there, etc.

And when it is necessary to go to the range, you receive it.

But, if you go somewhere on an operational assignment, etc., then

What -- vas there an officer in each department, who was responsible

for the weapons

Responsible for the weapons.

Of the department (otdel)

Yes.

Are you certain of this.

Absolutely... .

Dut, again, I say ((that)) in the beginning we kept, in 1253-54,

we kept ((then)) right in the safe.

Each man held ((his weapon)) in the safe.

But was it permitted to take (Cthe weapons)) home
No... no, no.

Well, anything... a person may get drunk... can happen’.

Here again... you confirm this absolutely exactly... but this ((is))

not wholly so.

I do not want to explain everything.

No.

There is no. objection to this.

The question ({is)), why were they not permitted to take ((the

It ‘is written in the ((idontification)) certificate: "It is permitted
to keep and bear...."

Well, the idea ((is)), this 1s what, a weapon.

You go to a meet (yavka), you return fron the neet, you (. have
documents, you must have a weapon....

The idea ((is)) ...-

But an employee could take ((a weapon)).

Please, take it; he could take ((it)) hone.

So the material lay at home. |
((But I received)) money for the tailoring ((of a uniform)).

Qhen... when... around 1956, from 1956 I did not receive (ya ne

resolved -- the employees repeatedly raised the question: "We are

After this... a nusber (ryad)... in a nunber of departments (otdel),
not in a nunber of departaents, but in all departnents, the problen 7
((of)) who would (budet) receive was resolved; department chiefs,

the leaders (ruxovodstvo) of the departments will decide who will : z :
receive civilian clothes, wio will receive military clothing. ;
“Let us suppose ((that)) a section ((is)) peripheral, is responsible :
(zaninayetsya) ((for functions concerning)) the periphery (Cice. ‘
outlying areas in the Soviet Union)).

(it was decided that ‘You will)) receive only military clothing;
civilian clothes are nothing for you; you do not work with agents
(agentura), and if you do work ((with azents)), you go ((for such
work)) only rarely”.

Taose who work against foreigners, against an enbassy, those fellows
were permitted to receive civiiian clothing.

We received civilian clothes -~ one time, on Rybnyy ((Street =

After 11 years, to say "a few times", this is almost ((as if to say

I passed by a few times, but I did not count how many tines. | 2

I did not have to, there was no need to pass along the whole of

you must now more than I, especially ((concerning)) more recent

Because in 11 years, not only in the way of work and cases, but
sinply because it happened so (tai nozhet byt'), I rode along,

walked along ((this street)).

Not necessarily.
It ((is just)) an alley (( dead end" = tupiche:)), a little

I have explained to you.

What I needed to know, I knew; I am explaining to you.

((can do)) so about other entrances:
I must say that a part of what you have said is the truth, as it

concerns 1953, approxinately.

Building 2, so, there in the Old Building; do I go much, often, to

“the New Building’

Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy!

Very rarely.

For what is it necessary for mc to go to 2uilding 12

If it was necessary for me to go to the Party Connittce (Partkoa) ,

I went to the Party Committee; if it was necessary for ne ((to g0))

to Personnel —~- it was not necessary for =e to go to Personnel, no
one phoned me; there was no need whatsoever for ne to fo to Personnel.
Where did I go.

I went to the sixth entrance in Building 12 ~~ this is FINO; there,

they receive money and they write out travel documents there <- I i

went there.
Now.
But, there is the cighth -- the Party Comaittee of the Komsonol

(Ci.e., the Xonsomol Committee, although B says, ‘Partkon Konsonola")),

when I went in 1953-54, then, the Party Party Committee ((i.e., the
Party Committee; B thus distinguishes it -- "Partkom Komsonol")) .
So, now, ((I went)) to the fourth entrance nost often, because (<eo))

had (prixhodilos') to give assignments (zadaniye) to the Second

here often.

I was at the second entrance a few times --.tais ((was)) about two

or three before ((my)) departure abroad; ((that is)) all.

‘here was no further necessity ((for me)) to go to Building 12.
Absolutely none.

I do not now, I do not know SAVCIL:

bout this.

I do not now.

I ((just)) now said: I went....

He is not dead; he was there, he is there.

((wait)) one minute.

I am tolling you ((that)) I went to the Second Special Department;

to whom did I give assignments.

Well, the first year, 1953 —- to KARASEV, personally to the Chief

of the Sccond Special Department; then, later, to ZABOLOTRYY «

To the Sixth Special Departuent -~ to SHCHIKOCHIXHIN, to SHCHIXOCHIXHIN
To whom else... well, you go, in the Second Special Department, to

For our next conversation, I want you to think a little about

these questions of which we have talked today.

But I have told you only that which I remember.

I think that we tried very hard to introduce order in the questions
and answers, but I do not see that you ((In inglish:)) clear up

everything.
‘foo bad (Naprasno), too bad.

I consider that you -~ despite sone truthfulness in your statenents,

((interrupts)) That which I know, I answer.

In addition, you make ({what)), in your view, perhaps, it seems,

((are)) small mistakes, but in my view -- very large ((ones)) -- H

I would not want our more or less friendly conversation to change to

stronger course (ruslo).

would consider it useful that you think ((about this)).

I have told you that, you see what —- you already put the question

is to help you and to help my colleagues in sone measure, though
they dre fully convinced and have their ((own)) correct opinion.
I think (schitat') that you should think in general about that
position in which you find yourself (nakhodit'sya).

And when we talk about ((some)) questions, if they ((i.e., the
ansvers)) are not known to you, it will be. much simpler to say that
"I was not there and I do not xnow than to drag in, or to do
sonething like that, your ((own)) conclusions, such as: "I inagine™
or “I think’.

Everyone can imagine and can Lie....

But that is the reason; you asx ne, but I tell you that I do not

knox, but I imagine so... thus.
Because imagination sonetimes can misinform (dezinformirovat')....

So, I emphasized to you: “It is my imagination’ (2G)... ((at))
this moment, when I have explained it to you, I have said that I

do not know exactly, I can only say "imagination".

One cannot, for example, believe == if a person has worked ((there))
12 years and knows that he began ((work)) in 1953; a person who has
worked there cannot say that, at the eighth entrance, he was in the

Personnel Department, which never was there ((at the eighth entrance)).

Well, if I went, ((if)) I had these conversations there....
Before my entrance (postupleniye) ((on duty)), precisely ((at that
time of entrance on duty)), and ((even)) now a part (chast') of

Personnel is there, it is (sidyat) ((there)).
