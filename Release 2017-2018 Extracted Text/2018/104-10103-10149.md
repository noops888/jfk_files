MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT :

Comments on George de Mohrenschildt

"Reputed Former CIA Agent"

REFERENCE: Memo for the Record, dated 4 April 19770

1: In a UPI article (see Tab A) published in the

Washington Star of 4 April 1977, George de Mohrenschildt

is referred to as a "reputed former CIA agent."

This

remark is

a misinterpretation of the facts by the writer

of the article.

A review of the de Mohrenschildt file

reveals that de Mohrenschildt had provided information, in

Desponse to the later earest this trap to yuess via

on his trip to Yugoslavia

in 1957 on behalf of the International Cooperation Agency

(ICA) •

This action does not make de Mohrenschildt a "CIA

agent," rather, it

makes him an unpaid informant.

The circumstances pertaining to CIA's interest in

de Mohrenschildt's knowledge of conditions in Yugoslavia

are set forth in the following paragraphs.

2.

On 3 June 1964, the Agency forwarded to J. Lee

Rankin, General Counsel,

President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy; the following intorm.

tion on George de Mohrenschildt.

"1.

Reference is made to your memorandum of

31 March 1964 requesting any information on George

and Jeanne de Mohrenschildt that is available to

CIA files.

Our review shows that the files contain

reports received from other U.S. Government agencies,

primarily the FBI, as well as

some information de-

_ veloped by this Agency in 1957 and 1958. The review

also produced references to information and the Office

of Strategic Services.

According to the records of

those agencies, George de Mohrenschildt had been con-

sidered for employment in 1942, but was

not hired

because he was alleged to be a Nazi espionage agent.

No information developed by CIA or its predecessors

before the assassination of President Kennedy had

established any link between de Mohrenschildt and

Lee Harvey Oswald and his family.

"i2. CIA's initial interest in George de

Mohrenschildt developed as a result of his sojourn

in Yugoslavia in 1957 on behalf of the International

Cooperation Agency (ICA). In that connection CIA

headquarters sent a routine advisory to its Dallas

representative who called on the de Mohrenschildt's

in the early part of December 1957. In the course

of several meetings the CIA representative obtained

foreign intelligence which was promptly disseminated

the other ter antative continue are accasional

contact with the de Mohrenschildt's until the autumn

of 1961. He has not seen them since that time, although

he received a Christmas card from them during the holiday

period following the assassination.

"3.

On the 23rd or 24th of November 1963, after

the assassination, our representative in badas Ie

ceived a telephone call from one of his contacts who

told him that several members of his firm had attended

a social or a discussion group in January 1963 and that

Lee Harvey Oswald had also been there.

Our repre-

sentative immediately arranged for the FBI to contact

the executive.

It was later ascertained from the FBl,

and from one of our sources, that George de Mohrenschildt

was present at the meeting and had introduced Oswald to

the group.

"4. At CIA headquarters the association between the

de Mohrenschildt's and the Oswald's was noted for the

first time in December 1963 when it was reported from

Haiti that the de Mohrenschildt's had appeared at the

Embassy and volunteered information about their rela-

tionship with the Oswald's.

At about the same time the

details of their association began to appear in reports

made by other U.S: Government agencies engaged in in-

vestigating the assassination.

"5. During the contact with George de Mohrenschildt

late in 1957 and 1958, his

background was investigated.

Inquiries

produced a considerable amount of information

about him

and his activities, including allegations

that during World War II he had engaged in espionage

activities on behalf of the Nazis; that he was a member

---

## Page 3

of the Communist Party; and that after the war he

was sympathetic toward Communism and the U.S.S.R.

The investigation was extended to Belgium where

George de Mohrenschildt claimed to have lived from

1930 until 1938.

His educational background and his

work as a journalist were confirmed there.

One record

of arrest came to light: on 4 November 1931 he was

sentenced by the Tribunal Correctionnel at Antwerp to

eight days in prison on charges of resisting a police

officer and to eight days imprisonment or a fine of

132 francs on charges of drunkenness and use of a false

Sentence was suspended pening completion of a

three-year probationary period.

"6. Throughout his adult life, George de

Mohrenschildt has used variations of his basic name,

Russian, to Polish, Swedish, Danish, and German.

There

appear to be two versions of his mother's maiden name:

Alexandra Latoskey and Alexandra Zapolski.

FBI Special Agent James F. Morrissey came to

CIA on 19 March 1964 and reviewed this Agency's files

on the de Mohrenschildt's.

"8. On 17 March 1964 the FBI furnished to this

Agency a report dated 28 February 1964.

The report pro-

vides details about one Yuri (George) de Mohrenschild's

contact with Fedor Alekseevich Garanin, who was a Soviet

diplomat in Washington, D.C., in 1946.

In that report

YUri (George de Mohrenschild

was described

as a petro-

leum engineer who had worked in the Texas oil fields

and in Venezuela.

Concerning Garanin, our records show

that he has been a member of the Soviet State Security

Service probably since the mid-1940's.

He served in

Cuba in 1943; after World War II he also served in the

According to our records

the Soviet State Security Service has also been known

to the FBI.

Office of Naval Intelligence; the Assistant Chief of

Staff, Intelligence, Department of the Army; the Depart-

3. As indicated above, the Agency was interested in

obtaining reports from de Mohrenschildt in 1957 relating to

his trip to Yugoslavia on behalf of the International Coopera-

tion Agency (ICA) •

Contact Division (now Domestic Collection

Division - DCD) had its representative in Dallas, J. Walton

Moore, contact de Mohrenschildt.

The history of

Moore's

relationship with de Mohrenschildt from 1957 to 1961 is

attached under Tab.C. In his testimony taken on 23 April 1964

at 200 Maryland Avenue NE, Washington, D.C.; by Mr. Albert E.

assistant counsel of the

President's Commission,

de Mohrenschildt described his contact with Walter Moore,

whom he referred to as G. Walter Moore [sic - J. Walton Moorel.

De Mohrenschildt's statement concerning Moore is contained

on page 235 of Volume IX of the Hearings before the President's

Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. A copy

of page 235 is attached under Tab D.

4. As a routine action, Moore requested traces on

de Mohrenschildt..

The traces (see Tab E) contained sufficient

derogatory information to preclude further extensive con-

tact with the de Mohrenschildt's. A summary of information

on de Mohrenschildt from the Office of Security appears

under Tab F.

5.

Conclusion: George de Mohrenschildt was never a

"recruited agent" of the Central Intelligence Agency.

For

approximately four years (1957 - 1961), a representative of

the Agency had had a periodic contact with de Mohrenschildt

for the purpose of obtaining overt information which the

latter obtained during his travels abroad. These contacts

4

## Page 5

were not clandestine nor did such contacts involve the

clandestine procurement of secret foreign intelligence.

So far as the Agency knows, de Mohrenschildt provided in-

formation in response to Moore's request as a patriotic

gesture, without thought of monetary gain.

JIr. JENNEE Well, this is September of 1962.

JIr. DE MOHRENSCHILDI. 10%, sure.

They were out of my mind. I forgot the

Ustralds.

Ir. JENNEL, No; 196, sir.

SIr. DE MOHENCETOr. No, no.

Now the Oswalds were out of my mind.

Mr. JENNE% You mean you have not been thinking about them.

JIr. DE MOHRENSCHILIT. Yes; I have not been thinking about them.

May I say a few things here that I remember? As I told you before, we met

the Oswalds through Boube, and then we talked about them to Max Clark, and

again to Boube.

And I asked Mr. Bouhe "Do you think it is safe for us to

help Oswald ?%:

Ir. Jerver You did have that conversation.

JIr. DE MOHRENSOHILDr.. Yes.

Ir. JeNNEs, Why did you raise that question?

Jr. DE MOrTENSCHILDr. I raised the queation because he had been to Soviet

Russia.

He could be anything, you see. And he could be right there watched

dar and night by the FBI. I did not want to get involved, you see. And I

distinctly remember, No. 1, that George Bouhe said that he had checked with

the FBI. Secondly, that in my mind Max Clark was in some way connected

with the FBI, because he was chief of security at Convair he had been a chief

of security. And either George Bonhe or someone else told me that he is with

the FBI to some extent. You never ask people "Are you from the FBI?" And

to me it la unimportant. But somehow in my mind I had this connected. And

so my fears were alleviated, you see.

I said, "Well, the guy seems to be OK."

Jow, I am not so clear about it, but I have the impression to have talked-to

hare asked about Lee Oswald also Mr. Moore, Walter Moore.

SIr. JENNER. Who is Walter Moore?

JIr. DE MORRENSOILyr. Walter Moore is the man who interviewed me on

behalf of the Government after I came back from YugoslaviaG. Walter Moore.

He is a Government man elther FBI or Central Intelligence. A very nice

fellow, exceedingly intelligent who is, as far as I know-was some sort of an

FBI man in Dallas. Many people consider him head of FBI in Dallas. Now,

I don't know.

Who does-you see.

But he is a Government man in some

eapacity. He Interviewed me and took my deposition on my stay in Yugoslavia,

what I thought about the political situation there. And we became quite friendly

after that. We saw each other from time to time, had lunch. There was a

mutual interest there, because I think he was born in China and my wife was

born in China. They had been to our house I think once or twice. I Just found

him a very interesting person.

When I was writing this book of mine, a very

peculiar incident occurred.

Mr. JENnEr. Which book?

Jr. DE MOHRENSCHILor. The last one the travelogue. One day we left for

Houston on a business trip, and I left all my typewritten pages, some 150 type-

written pages, in my closet. When I returned from the trip and started looking

through the pages, which had not been touched, supposedly, by anybody I

noticed small marks on the pages "No. 1" after five pages, "2"- amall marke

with a pencil, another five pages, No. 3, and so on and so forth.

I told my wife "Jeanne, have you fiddled around with my book?" She said,

"Of course not." I said, "That's imposalble." And I forgot it for a while.

In the evening we got back home, and we stayed in bed, and all of a sudden

the idea came back to me that somebody must have been in my apartment and

checked my book and read through that and took photographs.

And it was such

a horrible idea that Jeanne and I just could not sleep all night. And the next

morning we both of us went to see Walter Moore and told him, "Now, look

That happened to us. Have you Government people"— and I think I asked him

point blank, you know "Have you FBI people looked through my book?" He

sald, "Do you consider as such fools as to leave marks on your book if we had?

But we haven't." I said, "Can't you give me some protection against somebody

who has?" He said,

"Do you have any strong enemies?". I said, "Well, I

possibly have. Everybody has enemies." But I never could figure out who it was.

And it is still a mystery to me.

So I am not so sure whether I asked point blank Clark or Walter Moore

235

about Oswald. I probably spoke to both of them about him. My recollection

is, and also my wife's recollection is, that either of them said he is a harmles

lunatic. Later on Max got disgusted with him and said that he is a nogood

b-----d, a traitor, and so on and so forth. But by that time we already forgo

Oswald got Oswald out of your lives, you see. This is one point.

The second point is as you can see the whole of the Russian colony in Dallas

were Interested in Oswald one way or the other, because they represented

somebody who had been to their old country just recently, and could give

them the latest Information on what was going on. As I said, the old guard

were naturally against them right away.

The others were just curious.

Bu

this particular couple, Natasha and Igor Voshinin, refused to see them.

And

I Insisted sereral times,

"Why don't you see them? You love all the Russians

Why don't you meet Marina Oswald?" And she said, "Te don't want to, and

ore hare our reasons for not meeting them." And it kept on in my mind, 1

did not want to raise that question. But why didn't they want to meet them?

Mr. JeNNE. Well, tell me what is your speculation as to why they did not

want to meet them?

Mr. De MousENscalLoT. I do not have the slightest idea. Maybe they knew

something about Oswald, of some connection.

Mr. JenNer. Or maybe they were alarmed, and didn't want to take any

Chances®

Mr. DE MOHENsOHILDI. Maybe just that

Mr. JeNNEr But they were pretty firm in not having any trafic with them

Mr. De MonRENScHILot. Absolutely firm. The only ones. Maybe they mere

just more recently arrived In the United States and they were not so secure

like we were, you see. And possibly they were just alarmed of meeting some

body who just came from Soviet Russia.

Mr. JeNNeR. I think I will ask you at this point, Mr. De Mobrenschildt, you

are a man of very superior education and extremely wide experience and ac

quaintance here and in Europe, South America, West Indieg you have lired

an extremely colorful life.

You are acquainted to a greater or lesser degree

with a great variety of people.

Nr. DE MOHRENSCHILDT. Yes.

Mr. JENneR. Did there go through your mind speculations as to whether

Oswald was an agent of anybody?

Mr. DE MOHRENSCHILDT. NO.

Mr. Jerner. Why?

Before I put it that way when you say "No," am I

correct in assuming that you thought about the subject and you concluded he

was not an agent of anybody? Is that what you meant?

Mr. DE MOHRENSOHILDT. I never thought even about it. I will tell you why

I thought he never was-because he was too outspoken. He was too outspoken

In his ideas and his attitudes. If he were reallyif he were an agent, I

thought he would have kept quiet. This would be my idea.

Mr. JENNER. You say he was outspoken. What do you base that on?

Mr. De MOHRENSCHILDY. For instance, he showed me highe discussed very

freely with me, when he showed me his little memoirs.

Mr. JeNNer. I am going to show you those papers in a little while.

Mr. DE MOHRENSCHILDT. Those memoirs I think are very sincere.

They er

plain more or less the sincere attitude of a man, sincere opinion of a man.

Mr. JenNER. Before I show you any papers, I want you to finish this reasoning

of yours.

Mr. DE MOHeNsCHILDT. I did not take bim seriously that is all.

Mr. Jenner. I know you didn't. Why didn't you?

Mr. DE MOHRENSCHILDT. Well

Mr. JENNER. You are a bigbly sophisticated person.

Mr. De MOHRENSCHILD. Well, he was not sophisticated, you see. He was a

semieducated hillbilly. And you cannot take such a person seriously. All his

opinions were crude, you see.

But I thought at the time he was rather sincere.

NIr. JENNER. Opinion sincerely held, but crude?

Mr. DE MOHRENSCHILDT. Yes.

Mr. JENNeR. He was relatively uneducated.

Mr. DE MOHRENSCHILDT. Oh, yes.
