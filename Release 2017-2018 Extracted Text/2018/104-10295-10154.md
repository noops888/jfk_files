The following information and observations wore obtained

(nickname: Me) calle 25 - $526 Apt 8 (presumably cur 25th
St., No. 526.... Vedado - Telephone 303865.

(Note AMLASH has considerable confidance in his secretary,
and has suggested that letters or packages could be sent
there on a one or two-shot deal.)

2. In response to the question of whom AMLASH
might turn to in order to carry out his plans, AMWHIP
mentioned the following persons:

Jose ACEP Yarm, ca. 33 yrs old, who is functionary
‘ ‘in'Wavana nunicipal govt. le is
‘ef moorigh deadént.) Has wide
‘circle of. acquaintances in Havana.

Of the above, A/l felt that GUIN, (ACEF) The WIEVES; NARANJO)
and A) HAS\were the most dependable. The degree to
whioh (Juan ALMEIDA could be trusted was questioned by A/1.
In addition to the above names which A/} volunteered, he
asked about (Major DIAZ“ARGUELLES, \Major Tony CASTELS) an
‘Major Faure CHOMON. A/1 stated that he felt DIAZ-AliGl
ind his brother "Tin-T couJd be used and were trustworthy;
TEL aud_CHOMON, on the other hand, would not be utilized
in the initial efforts by AMLASH, but, if his efforts were
successful, they could be counted on to support LASH in the

olf period which followed, They would never be taken into the

hot know these types well and therefore had little to say
regarding them. Ie did say that he did not cure for (GALVEZ)
personally and that he was a little “psycho"; BORDON was

OK; {PEREZ\ was an older man, ca. 60 years, who was a

nonentity who had his rank because he had guided the GRA!
group) into_the_hills at the beginning of the fight against

Batista: ‘LUSSON\ wae probably too loyal to Raul CASTRO to be
considered for any initial action. 7 a eae

hen questioned about the identities of followers
of Major of TRAS\|, A/l stated that it would be better to
refer to H, as he (A/1) could only give information that
was three years old and hence not very accurate. We did not
press the question, nor suggost names, as it was evident
that he felt that his answers would simply not give a true,
current picture.

5. A/l provided the full nane of a possible lead :
which he had disc: lier with Ontrich: (eee :

6. In addition to the above information, the
undersigned discussed various aspects of the AMLASII case,
and in particular, questioned A/l about AMLASH's frame of
mind and future plans which he may have revealed to A/l
after Ontrich departed the scene. A/} made several points,
which basically botlea down to the fact that AMLASI was
still not pleased with the support he was getting from the
USG side. The visit with DAINOLND, who acted in the capacity
of a representative of high levels of the Govt concerned
with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMLASH as far as policyy
was concerned , but he was not af all happy with the fact
that he still was not given the technical assistance for
the operational plan as he saw it. A/l said that AMLASH
dwelt constantly on this point, He could not understand
why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which
promised a final solution to the problem, while, on the
other hand, the USG gave much equipment and money to exile
groupe for their ineffective excursions against Cuban
coastal targets, According to A/1, AMLASH feels strongly
on this point, and if he does not get advice and matertals

et tale Shs,

from USG technician, he will probably become fed-up again,
and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date.
A/1 stated that AMLASN now has his feet wet vis-a-via
cooperating with USG and has accepted the fact that he will
Work profitably and securely with it. It is this that we
stand to lose with our procrastination. AMLASH also
talked about going to. the French terrorist group, the OAS,
in order to get the materials and guidance he needs. It
is believed. that he was talked out of thia idea, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASH,

7. With regard to the radio gear, AMLASH stated
that he did not feel that he wanted to take one in with
him, particularly in view of the recent arrests in Cuba
of agents carrying concealed radios. Tle was not opposed,
however, at this time to havingza radio cached for hin,
to be recovered by him later,

8. According.to AMMIP, 1f there is any interest
in having AMLASH Link up with other trusted assets in
Cuba, these names would have to be Given to him berore he
returned; otherwise he would not trust any other means
used later inside to get hin to initiate or respond to such
contacts. }

9. A/l stated that AMLASH talked about getting
aid from, or at least discussing his position, with
Magolo RAY. However, he stated that he questioned whether
this was the best idea, since if RAY came to Paris while
he (LASH) was there, people would conclude that there was:
something between the two, Another spot wouid be better,
thought AMLASH,

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMLASH
said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris
staffer) upon his return to Paris. (This he subsequently
did on the 15th of November, according to info received
from Paris-somewhat belatedly).

»

ll. When AMLASII, A/I, and VENEGAS were together
in Rome and Italy, VENEGAS told AMLASI that people were

betting that LAS would not return to Cuba. Some had algo
questioned his mother on this point. AMLASH reportedly
told VENEGAS to cover all the hets he could as he would
be a rich man. (It was at this time, according to A/l,
that AMLASH decided that he had better return to Havana
