BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at_a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,
Daniel HARKER.
———

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,
8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There-can-be:no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO: appéarance, which had not been

event represented a more-than-ordin.

3. CASTRO'’s statements to HARKER covered a range of

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary
reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing
the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

5 the replay by United States newspapers like the
New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that
CASTRO's “message” was significantly modulated. >
5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle‘of Séptember 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune,
on Monday, 9 Septesber-—page-?, under a three-column head-
line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders
Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the
HARKER by-lines .
“Havana (AP) - Prime Minister
Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.
leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba."

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'"

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,
used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference
to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real
significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated re~
write (9 September, page A~7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

of tH HARKER.dhtexview, placing the emphasis on the po-

elements and buxying CASTRO's warning to the United States
leadership in the middle of the piece.

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headquarters attention to. the AP story very shortly after
the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

13. DELGADO'S’ testimony has the cast of credibility.

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

and talked with him for between one and a half to two hours.
The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually
there is nothing like it - on the record ~ in everything else

no identification of the £1 Toro contact. . DELGADO's presump-

“Luisa” received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden=

now, that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians! ...*

"20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the
assassination. “Luisa® also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had been-called off so it would not appear

that they were. celebrating. the death of KENNEDY, nor would
they have the party coindide with the burial. Finally she

"22. ‘The tenuous, enignmatic character ofthe conversation
is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

a. _“"Luisa" was.probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON, a! cadre worker of the Cuban

pirectorate.Genéral of Intelligence (DGI).

-She-returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported i

“to be working in DGI Headquarters. i

oe b- The DGI element in Mexico City in the
fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz
who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally
as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE
(departed 19 November 1963). The“deputy DGI
chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL"S successor)
was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

ce. The "Silvia DURAN” named in Luisa’s
conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican
national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known
visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban
installationg in connection with a Cuban visa
application for stay and/or transit.
Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the
record regarding OSWALD's activity in
Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its
entixety was taken and presented, solely, by the
Mexican Governmental authorities. A dixect

confrontation with wher was requested by the
Warren Commission staff but rejected by the
Mexican authorities. It is from Silvia DURAN's
statenents-that it was learned that OSWALD
bécametengaged in a personal altercation on
27 septimber with Eusebio AZCUE.

da. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,
alias Marcos, and his DGI assistant,
Rogelis RQDRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively
identified in February 1964 by two independent
sources as engaged in the active development
and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan
agents for the purpase of assassinating
General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, “it is estab-

lished, was on post in Mexico City during

OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October
1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963
for Havana. It was reliably reported about
VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally
or illegally, had to pass through him first. He !
took the biographical data and@ sént'it to Cuba

for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days.>

23. There-is no evidence in the OSWALD case file that
Silvia DURAN was subjected to a systematic elicitative
intezxogation sthat, would have related her dealings with
ostignD: exon contiimed by intercept, with the data held
on the Chbah DGI, its personalities and methods, in
Mexico City. Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,
considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the :
applications to be handled solely by a local employee and
a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the
DGI chie#? Whatever the answer to these questions, they
.were not asked at the time. And there remains the more
fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its
face, could it haV@happened without the Knowledge and —

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This

seems unlikely especially because VEGA is later gited py ©. ~

24. The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia DURAN
testimony already have been suggested above. (In that
context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider
the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations
on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,
and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquim Hernandez ARMAS,
because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-
tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about [or been
offered?] money payments by her Mexican interrogators.)
