2. According to EISENSCHER’ ‘the CPUSA has close to
14 7000 members, the majority of whom are laborers.

Over 25 percent of. the members are blacks who function
“basically in the North American black movement. The
Party has recently organized a young Communist movement, .:<
(Comment: This is probably the Young Workers Liberation
League.) ..The CPUSA participates heavily in the labor
movement. At a recent (unnamed) labor meeting of repre-
sentatives from various regions of the United States, the.
CPUSA. had direct influence in 26 of the 50 unions repre-
sented. The: magazine Labor Party”plays an important role”
in coordinating movements within the labor ranks. Despite
numerous barriers (sic), the CPUSA is concentrating its
efforts in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, as well as
other Tegions of importance. The CPUSA has recently
adopted a common strategy towards the peace movement.
(Comment: The indication here is that the Party did not

. previously have a unified approach.)

3. EISENSCHER stated that criticisms of the Soviet
Union by the radical left Maoists, Fidelists, and Trot-
skyites cause problems, but they appear to have abated
. somewhat. There has been a warming in the relations
between the CPUSA and the Communist Party of Cuba as a
