IX. ALLEGATION BY GILBERTO NOLASCO ALVARADO UGARTE

The first.confidential source abroad advised that
on November 25, 1963, GILBERTO NOLASCO ALVARADO UGARTE, a
Nicaraguan citizen born January 31, 1940, in Ciudad Rama,
Departamento Zelaya, Nicaragua, made contact with the United
States Embassy at Mexico, D. F., and advised the following:

ALVARADO entered Mexico illegally from Guatemala on
August 29, 1963, traveled to. Mexico, D. F., and subsequently
made contact with EDELBERTO TORRES, a Nicaraguan communist
residing in Mexico City. From this contact a plan was
developed for ALVARADO to travel to Cuba to study guerrilla
warfare tactics. He had octasion to visit the Cuban Consulate.
in Mexico, D. F., several different times for the purpose of
obtaining travel documentation for Cuba by furnishing false
identification papers as a Mexican citizen, —

ALVARADO claimed’ that the real purpose behind his
proposed travel to Cuba was a penetration mission for the
Nicaraguan Secret Service. He stated that on September 18,
1963, he went to the Cuban Consulate, and while sitting in
the waiting room saw a group of approximately eight persons
enter the Consulate and the office of Cuban Consul EUSEBIO
AZCUE. A person unknown to him was sitting at AZCUE's. desk.
A short time later, while ALVARADO was standing near the door
to the men's room at the Cuban Consulate, he noticed three
men conversing a few feet away from him. One of them was a
tall, thin Negro with reddish hair; the second was a man whom
ALVARADO had seen previously holding a Canadian passport .in
the waiting room of the Cuban Consulate; and the third person,
according to ALVARADO, was LEE HARVEY OSWALD.

ALVARADO stated that a tall Cuban joined the above
group momentarily and passed some United States currency to
the Negro.

The following conversation between the Negro and
OSWALD was overheard by ALVARADO:

Negro (in English): I want to kill the man.

OSWALD: You're not man enough. I can do it.

~ 157 -
SECRET ae



SECRET

Negro (in Spanish): I can't go with you. I have
a lot to do.

OSWALD; The people are waiting for 1 me back there.

ALVARADO stated that the Negro then gave OSWALD
$6,500 in United States currency of large denominations,
sayingt “This isn't much." Of this sum, $1,500 was for extra
expenses. The Negro also gave OSWALD about 200 Mexican pesos.

In a later interview, ALVARADO stated that the
United States bank notes were in a small pack about one fourth
of an inch thick, bound with a paper band, which the Negro
broke before counting out $1,500 extra for expenses and $5, 000
as "advance payment."

ALVARADO stated that OSWALD had carried a green
passport in his pocket, and he believed he saw OSWALD wearing
a pistol in a shoulder holster, but he was not sure of this
point, He stated that OSWALD had long shoes and a wrist watch
with a yellow-metal band. According to ALVARADO, OSWALD
appeared to be completely at home at the Consulate and to know
and to be known by Cuban Consulate personnel,

ALVARADO was arrested and interrogated by Mexican
authorities on November 28, 1963, and a copy of the interro-
gation report by the Mexican authorities revealed the following:

At the outset ALVARADO's story generally resembled
that recorded above. He repeated to the Mexican ‘authorities
the details of the scene in which he saw the Negro, the ©
Canadian and the American conversing together, the delivery
of the money to the American by _ Negro, and the conversation eee
he overheard.

ALVARADO advised the interviewing Mexican officials ke
that upon seeing the photograph of OSWALD in the newspapers
following the assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY, he
Se bee OSWALD as the American he had seen at the Cuban

onsulate.

An excerpt from ALVARADO’s statement to Mexican
authorities, as translated from Spanish, is as follows:

- 158 ~
SECRET


SECRET

“.....spontaneously and after reconsidering he
desires to state that the american to whom he
referred in the body of his statement and whom
he saw the 18th of September of this year in the
Cuban Consulate had a certain resemblance, about
sixty per cent, to LEE HARVEY OSWALD (assassin
of the President of the United States); That
after the assassination of President KENNEDY the
witness took advantage of this fact in his favor
to exploit it, furnishing versions such as those
initially set forth, for the purpose of provoking ©
an energetic reaction from the political point of
view on the part of the United States of America

_ against the government of FIDEL CASTRO RUZ and
that he had no motive other than the profound
hatred he feels for communism. That all his life
the witness has dedicated himself to combating
communism and he regrets at this moment not having
accomplished his objective in the sense of causing
@ reaction on the part of the American Government
against FIDEL. CASTRO."

Because of the fact that subsequent to making the
above-mentionec statement to Mexican authorities, ALVARADO
claimed that he had changed his statement because of fear,
he was interviewed at considerable length on December 5 and
6, 1963, in Mexico, D. F., by representatives of the United
States Government.

T~-17 advised as follows:

: After reiterating his story, ALVARADO was afforded
a polygraph examination on December 6, 1963. During the course
of the examination he was asked, "Is this the American you saw
in the Cuban Consulate?" At the time he was shown photographs
of OSWALD. -

Each time he was asked this question, he definitely
responded, "Yes," but it was noted that the polygraph indicated
a "deception response" on these answers. These responses and
those with respect to other questions led to the conclusion
that ALVARADO was a fabricator. It was specifically pointed
out to him that the polygraph indicated that he was not being

SECRET ‘

truthful in identifying photographs of OSWALD as being
of a person he saw in the Cuban Consulate, and he was asked
for his explanation thereof,

- ALVARADO replied that he had full faith in the
polygraph and would not attempt to refute its results. He
went on to say that the only explanation he could offer was
that he had seen an American in the Cuban Consulate on
September 18, 1963, who resembled OSWALD, and that upon
seeing the photograph of OSWALD in the newspaper, he built
up within himself, either consciously or subconsciously, a
complete belief that the person he had seen in the Cuban ~
Consulate was OSWALD. i

‘. ‘On December 8, 1963, Mexican authorities deported
ALVARADO from Mexico, BD. F., to Managua, Nicaragua.

X, | MISCELLANEOUS INQUIRIES AND ALLEGATIONS
RELATING TO OSWALD

{A) Allegation by SALVADOR DIAZ VERSON
Concerning OSWALD and SILVIA DURAN

According to the first confidential source abroad,
the White House at Washington, D. C,, had received a paper
entitled "Possible Psychological Motivations in the Assassi-
nation of President KENNEDY" written by: JOSE I, a 2340
N. E, 7th Avenue, Apartment 4, Miami, Florida,

This speculative paper attempted to establish that
the motivation of OSWALD in the assassination of President
KENNEDY was FIDEL CASTRO or a CASTRO agent and that OSWALD
was so motivated during his trip to Mexico between September
27 and October 2, 1963. The paper included the allegation
that OSWALD had an extended interview with the Cuban Ambassador
to Mexico, whom he met at a restaurant on the outskirts of
Mexico, D. F., from where they departed together in the Cuban
ambassador's automobile for a private conversation. :

LASAGA had advised the White House that he received
the above report from ANGEL FERNANDEZ VARELA, an employee of
the Voice of Cuba in Miami, Florida, who received the infor-

Remarks: Per the cover sheet, CI Staff thinks it has
found the specific memo on Oswald/Cuba/Mexico City.
But if you look at pp/159-160, you will note the memo
states Alvarado, the source, was a fabricator, Hence
the decision at the morning meeting to actually

go to the FBI and ask still seems quite logical.
