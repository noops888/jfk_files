of birth of the Luis TEDISCHI rho, according ti a saually rellable source, was being

corsidered for recruitment in 1913 by the PIS, or was actually working for the FIS.

As stated In Hats 515, our source reported that the address used by TEDiSCill during

the carly part of 1943 was Picnincha 969, Buenos Area.

Collateral infornation on Luis TIDISCHI of Pichincha 969, Suenos Aires,

has been found in a 1912 document which appears to have been based on censorship

"his document indicates that TaciSCi's address, as given above, wag a

cover address for a JDE (Valon Denocratica ispanola) manifesto sent iron Cubs.

Also one TRUEECHI, Estados Unido 1306, Buenos Airos, was riven as a cover address

In a secret writing massage. A copy of the pertinent portions of this document

Is attached.

3o It 1s hoped that a unilateral surveillance on the Luig TEDEDCHI living at

51 Domador 3150,

Suenos Afros, 1f Instituted as the station planned, will be

fruitful. Headquarters will be extramly interested in ary furthar information on
