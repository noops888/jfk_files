Mazurov Report on Centrai Comm_ -tee

Minsk Domestic Service in Belorussian 0545 GMT 28 September 1951--1

(OFFICIAL USE ONLY)

(Report by First Secretary of the Central Cormittee of the Belorussian

Communist Party Mazurov on the work of the Central Committee of the

Belorussian Communist Party, at the 25th Congress of the Belorussian

Communist Party)

(Text) Comrades: In an atmosphere of unprecedented labor and political

enthusiasm, the Soviet, people are marching toward the 22d Congress of

the CPSU.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and carrying

out the decisions of the 20th and 2lst congresses of the CPSU, the

working people of our country are achieving ever new success in the

building of cormuniam. The seven-year plan is heine marbled out

successfully.

We must not forget even for a minute that a fierce ideological

struggle is in progress in the world, a struggle which knows no

respite. Bourgeois ideologists have not abandoned their hopes of

their solidarity in support of the Communist Party. In their subversive

work they are striving to find support among people who are morally

debased and burdened with the ideology of private ownership. Drunkards,

thieves and profiteers,

idlers and spongers are immediate targets

of the bourgeois agents' attention. The struggle against these

elements requires the participation of the whole community.

At one time, party and administrative organs carried out much work

attracting the public to the campaign against crime and the

violation of public order, and against immoral phenomena.

I have in

mind the end of 1959 and the beginning of 1960. The wide network of

voluntary people's squads and comrades' squads was then set up in the

republic; these bodies began to render active assistance in the work

of upbringing. But many gorkoms and raykons of the party have treated

the struggle against the antisocial phenomena as a short term campaign.

In a number of places the people's squads and the comrades' squads

not to a cate de here and there exiet only on paper,

The campaign against crime has been relaxed by the public prosecutor's

department and the republic's public prosecutor, Comrade Bondar, the

supreme court and Chairman Comrade Shardyka, the Belorussian SSR

Ministry for Internal Affairs and Minister Comrade Aksenov, and their

local organs. Sometimes they display Iiberalism and forebearance

manet on a work ate and vala

Party organs should reinforce the

campaign against crime and violation of laws, and guide in an active

manner the work of administrative organs and the forces of civic

organizations toward complete eradication of crime and the violation

of the rules of socialist life of the community.

An active fight against the manifestations of bourgeols morality and the

upbringing of the soviet people in the spirit of communism constitutes.

a most important task of party propaganda and a sacred duty of all

the workers of the ideological front-all communists.

Moscow

PRAVDA 29 May 71 L

[Text] Minsk, 28 May (IASS)-Today in the Belorussian Communist Party Central

Committee a

conference was held of leading workers of internal affairs organs, and

of representatives of party, trade union and Komsomol organizations, and of

Belorussian ministrles and departments. The conference was devoted to questions of

further strengthenins law and order and socialist legality in light of the 24th

CPSU Congress decisions.

Belorussian Internal Affairs Minister A.A. Kilmoyskoy gave a report.. He spoke about

the great work of the organs of the militia, the procuratorate, and the people's

courts in propagandizing juridical and legal knowledge among the young, and workers

and empolyees of enterprises and institutions, and about the broad participation of

the working people of the Republie's elties and villages in the struggle with

violations of public order.

CPSU Central Comnittee Politburo candidate member and Belorussian Communist Party

Central Committee First Secretary P.M. Masherov, as well as USSR Internal Affairs

Minister N.A. Shchelokov gave speeches at the conference.

Shchelokov Speech

(Editorial Report--I] Minsk SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA 30 May publishes on page two a

3,000-word BELIA-attributed report on a conference of the leading workers of the

republic's administrative organs on 28 May, devoted to the discussion of the problems

of consolidating law and order.

SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA reports the speech delivered

Internal Affairs Minister NeA. Shchelokov as follows:

USSR Internal Affairs Minister N.A. Shchelokov made a speech. He noted

successes of the working people of

Belorussia In communist building.

At every stor

In the republic, which until the October Revolution was an unfortunate district,

and was devastated in the years of the Great Patriotic War, one now sees the fruits

of tremendous progress, the ebullient labor life, which is full of enthusiasm, and

the remarkable economic achlevements.

Speaking of the tasks of the administrative organs stemming from the decisions of the

24th CPSU Congress, N.A. Shchelokov stressed that the consolidation of law and order

and socialist legality is an integral part of the improvement of social relations in

the period of building communism.

The movement toward communism proceeds not through

a decrease, but through an intensification in the Individual's responsibility to

society. And this is completely law governed, Soclety is becoming ever more highly

organized. No antisocial manifestations, self-wilt or anarchism, lack of discipline

or crimes can have a place in society.

From this also stems the essence of the CPSU

measures for consolidating law and order and legality. This essence can be reduced

to the introduction of legal norms in accordance with the level of social relations

and social awareness which has been achieved and with higher moral criterla for

people's behavior.

The consolidation of law and order is also linked with the further process of the

democratization. of our soolety.

Socialist democracy is Incompatible with neglect

of one's duty as a citizen and with any actions which are detrimental to the

state's Interests.

USSR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS

However, the vestiges of the past do not disappear by themselves, just as crime

does not disappear by itself.

Communist morality and world outlook are confirmed

and purposeful organizational and educational work of the party, state organs and

the whole public is needed.

The instructions

of the 24th CPSU

Congress for the consolidation of law and order

and legality are a program of just such a plan-governed and purposeful work, N.A.

Shchelokov stressed.

In the last 5year period there has been an all-round increase in the role of the

internal affairs organs in the organization of preventive work, and in Insuring

the Leninist principle of the inevitability of punishment. Radical measures have

been taken for consolidating legality and for decisively Increasing the standard

In the work of the militia, and for unearthing cases of lawlessness and tyranny.

The ties of the internal affairs organs with the public have been expanded and

consolidated and their authority has been increased. Special attention has been

and is being paid to the questions of the scientific organization of labor and

management.

Much has been done for a qualitative improvement in the cadres

composition.

The USSR internal affairs minister illustrated the

results of the work which has been

done with examples from Belorussia.

He spoke of the fact that the republic's

party organization and the Belorussian Government are raising and developing by all

possible means the activeness of the soviets of working people's deputies, of the

economic organs and the labor collectives in the struggle for exemplary

law and order and for the consolidation of legality. And this is bringing good

frult; law violations and crime are being reduced.

In Implementing the decisions of the 24th CPSU Congress, N.A. Shchelokov said, we

must do everything so that the activity of the internal affairs organs, the

court and the prosecutor's office assists to the maximum degree the implementation

of the plans for communist building outlined for the ninth 5-year plan.

general line in all this work should be preventive measures, the necessity for which

18 dictated by the entire system of our life, by our morality, and by our aspira

tion to wage the struggle for the fate of every person, not allowing him to enter

Into serious conflict with the law and society.

The collectives of the enterprises, institutions, construction sites, kolkhozes

and sovkhozes are called on to play a great role in preventive work.

The question

of the Interaction of the internal affairs organs with the trade union organizations

and the Komsomol is a very important one. The spearhead of preventive work should

be aimed at preventing law violations and crime among juveniles..

to do everything for the rising generation to be educated in a spirit of the high i

noral principles of communism, and to be the worthy continuer of their fathergl. aw

heroic affairs.

Further the speaker mentioned the importance of increasing efficiency in the whole

activity of the Internal Affairs Ministry

It is essential to constantly

improve the management system, and work in selecting, placing, training and

educating cadres, and to consolidate official discipline by all possible means.

The

USSR Internal Affairs Ministry must pay special attention to these questions.

MILITARY COURT SENTENCES HITLERITE COLLABORATOR TO DEATH

IV. Mikhaylov article: "Not Destined To Oblivion"]

[Text]

The military tribunal of the Red Banner Belorussian MilItary Distriot has

concluded. the open trial of the traitors to the motherland and underlings of the

Hitlerite fascists during the Great Patriotio War, F.A. Korotkevich and N.S. Shkradyuk.

examination, under the chairmanship of the It col of Justice Ye. N.

Porokhovnichenko, lasted for more than 2 weeks.

The testimonies of many witnesses

large number of documents collected in connection with the case

were read; ineluding captured documents.

All this helped the court to reconstruct

fully the ploture of the grave erimes perpetrated by the betrayers of the Russian

people.

in the Soviet Army

and finding himself on Belprussian territory temporarily

occupied by Hitlerite troops in the fall of 1941, Korotkevich turned traitor to the

motherland and voluntarily Joined the German punitive organs--the secret field poliee

aFP-718.

For particular zeal he was promoted to the rank of private first class and

assigned to a special operational group commanded by the fascist executioner (Ribernik)

and was the police battalion's interrogator.

Shkradyuk crossed over to serve the

occupationists in April 1942.

The Hitlerite hirelings carried out active punitive

activities against Soviet people and helped the fascists to annihilate peaceful in-

habitants.

shows their personal participation in many

crimes:

In the fall of 1942 Korotkevich and Shkradyuk together with other members of the

punitive organs participated in the execution of two groups of arrested Soviet

citizens who were in Bobruysk Prison. Among them were women and children.

The

members of the punitive organs made the severely beaten and tortured people lie face

diwn in previously dug pits and then cold-bloodedly fired into them point-blank.

At

the end of August and beginning of September of the same year Korotkevich partieipated

in a punitive operation conducted on the territory of the Kirovskly and Klichevskly

rayons in Mogilev Oblast. During the course of this operation the members of the

punitive organs organized roundups and pogroms, seized peaceful inhabitants, tortured

them during interrogations, and then executed them in a nursery garden on the out-

skirts of Lyubonichi village in Ktrövskly Rayon, Together with other members of the

punitive organs, Korotkevich tortured the inhabitants of the villages stogalovo,

Dubrov, and Kostrichi.

In February 1943 in the village of Iskra In Svetlogorskiy

Rayon he arrested the Sovlet patriot A.I. Verzhbitskly, whose subsequent fate 1s

unknown.

In the spring of the same year in Parichi he tortured Nikolay Grinenko,

an inhabitant of Selishche village, and Ivan Lopukhin, from Stepa village in the

Zhlobinskly Rayon, and In Bobruysk he tortured two Soviet eitizens who had tried to

Join the partisans.

In May and June 1944 the punitive members of the GPP command, while retreating

together with the fascists, arrested a group of patriots in Albertin village in the

Slonimskly Rayon: Leontly Skarupich, Aleksandr Zmitrovich, Mikhayll Lavu, Varfolomey

Salltu, Anton Rudman, Pavel Myshko, and Vladimir Strupovets.

After being tortured

and tormented they were all shot.

USSR MILITARY AFFAIRS

In court Korotkevich tired to extricate himself.

However, the witnesses

testimonies and the documents collected in the investigation completely unmasked

this Inveterate murderer.

During the course of the trial it was established that the Hitlerite hirelings

distinguished themselves by particular barbarity. Together with similar cutthroats,.

Korotkevich once beat a prisoner to death in the courtyard of Bobruysk Prison. He

and other members of the punitive organs forced the inhabitants bf Markovshchina

village in Klichevskiy Rayon to walk along the Klichev-Stoyalovo road so as to

clear the mines on it.

During this, one of the village's inhabitants, Mikhail

Miroshnichenko, was blown up by a mine. There was a case of the executioners making

a man condemned to death sing and dance before execution. In April 1943 Shkradhyuk

was on short term leave in Podlipye village in Bobruysk Rayon. On learning that an

inhabitant of this village, M.T. Kovalkov, had been arrested, he hurried to the

police base and began beating Kovalkov with an iron rod and then struck his head

against a brick wall. Shkradyuk also

cruelly tortured the partisan, I: Ya. Melnikov,

an inhabitant of Progress village, who was there after being captured by the fascists.

With their masters, the traitors escaped to the West.

After the war they returned

to the Soviet Union but kept silent about their participation in punitive actions.

Shkradyuk lived In Tselinograd Oblast, and Korotkevich, having changed his surname,

first name, patronymic, and nationality, settled in Baranovichi, thinking that he

would scarcely be sought so near the places of the crimes. This monster, who has

had three wives since the war, sank to the lowest level of moral degradation.

The Belorussian state security organs have had to carry: out much painstaking work

to find and unmask the traitors. Despite the fact that more than quarter of a

century has passed sonce the war, just retribution has caught up with the criminals.

The military tribunal has sentenced F.A. Korotkevich to the supreme form of punishment....

execution--and N.S. Shkradyuk to 12 years imprisonment in a strict regime corrective-

labor colony.

There are no periods of prescription or mercy

for those who perpetrated crimes during

the war. Sochier of later the well-deserved punishment will overtake: them all.

BRIEFS

SOVIET FORCE IN GERMAN AKTIV--GrOUp of Soviet Forces in Germaly--the communists and all

fighting men of the group of forces unanimously support the party's leninist foreign

policy course.

This was clearly expressed in the work and decisions of the party akti?

meeting which discussed the results of the work of the CPSU Central Committee May (1972)

plerum.

The meeting was addressed by Col Gen S/Kurkotkin, group of forces commander.

Expressing the opinion of all communists of the group of forces the party aktiv meeting

assured the CPSU Central Committee that the personnel of the units and subunits

will make every effort to implement suocessfully the historic decisions of the 24th

party congress and subsequent CPSU Central Committee plenums and will honorabls fulfill

their duty of insuring the security of our great motherland and the countries of

the socialist community.

US. DOMESTIC AFFAIRS

Back in March 1918, when the Seventh Party Congress was discussing, the resolution

"On War and Fonde," Vladimir Illoh said:

*...No lind ourselves in conditions undor

which military secrete are becoming very important major lannes for the Munaian Repubil,"

(Volume 36 page 41).

These instructiona from Lenin are Just as relevant today, when

enemy intelligence services are attempting to conduct total espionage in the socialiat

countries, resorting to diverse insidious subterfuges from agents penetrating to our

secrets

to obtaining the information they need by deduotion from talks with Soviet

people.

Particular attention 1s devoted to the extraction of actentific and technicai

information from our scientists during varlous international congresses, symposiums,

and exhibitions and also during private

meetings with Soviet speclalists. Acting on

Instructions from their intelligence services, certain Western scientists strive to

obtain

secret information from Soviet scientists under the pretext of la common interest

in sclence."

Soviet people are standing vigilantly on guard over state secrets. But 1t 1s impossible

to avold noting that we sometimes encounter instances of indifference or even careless-

negg.

Individual citizens, forgetting the enemy's desire for intolligence and wishing.

to display thelr own knowledge, blurt our important stato secrets, inflicting definite

harm on our motherland'g interests. The great Russian writer Saltykov-Shohedrin once

wrote the following about this category of people:

"There are people incapable of

keeping to themselves any single thought that comes into their head or any plece of

news heard from somebody else.

They cannot rest until they have blurted everything

out, that 1s, until they have told

at least five soparate people what they know."

This

- carelessness must be resolutely combated. Every Soviet person, and particularly those

with access to secrets, should constantly remember that so long as imperialist states

and their intelligence agencies exist, it is necessary in all places and at all times

to strictly preserve state and party secrecy so that any lacunae which enemy Intelligence

services could exploit are firmly sealed.

The essence of the apt folk expression "a

blabbermouth is a real find for a spy" should be firmly grasped by all our citizens.

The Imperialist states! ruling circles assign a considerable role in the implementation

of their subversive plans to ideological subversion as one of the sharpest weapons in

the class struggle against the sociallet countries.

This 1s expressed In practical

terms in agitprop or Intelligence organization actions, undertakings, and operations

aimed at undermining socialism from within and discrediting the socialist system ard

the Ideas of Marxism-Leninism in the eyes of peoples throughout the

enemy propaganda levels particular attacks against the CPSU--the most authoriative

and influential force in the communist movement.

The enemies of communism rabidly

attack our party for refusing to budge from positions of principle and confidently

leading the Soviet people along the path of building a communist society.

The Importaliats otubbornly attempt to attaok the Soviet people's moral prinoiples and

most sacrod leelings- their love for the homeland and their native communist party

and Its Leninist Central Committee. They want to shake our faith in the nature and

correctness of the great cause for which we are fighting, prevent Soviet people being

reared in the spirit of patriotism and Ideological-political and moral stanchness,

and thereby brake the soviet people's victorious movement toward communism. The

practical recommendations of Alard Von (Shakk), a West German "§peatalist" 1n

psychological operations, are not without interest here. (paragraph continues)

USSR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS

The visits by Comrade I. I. Brezhnev, general scoretary of the CPSU Ointral Committee,

to the FRO and the United

States and also his meetings with a. Pompidou, president of

France, concentrated In themselves, as at a focal point, a radical improvement in the

international atmosphere. A still greater thaw has arrived In relations betwen

East and West.

All this, however, must not serve us as grounds for complacency and indifference.

It

would be

wrong

to

believe that, in connection with the certain relaxation of international

tension and the prospects for improved cooperation between the socalist and capitalist

states, our ideologloal opponents will cease of at least reduce thily subversive

activities.

On the contrary, 'knowing the nature of Imperlalism, we must expect....

1ts special services and ideological centers to continue to try st11l more actively to

use varlous. forms of international communication for purposes hostile to socialism

and

communism.

In his report at the joint ceremonial session of the CPS' Central Committee, the USSR

Supreme Sovlet, and the RSFSR

Supreme Soviet in Moscow on 21 December 1972 Leonid Ilich

Brechnov said:

"The CPSU proceeded and now proceeds from the premiss that tho class

struggle of the two systems--capitallet and soclallat.. In the sphere of economtos,

polities, and, of course, Ideology will continue..

It cannot be otherwise for the

wordd

outlook and class alms of socialisn and capitalism are opposed and trreconetlable."

This Is why the further raising of the Sovlet people's political vigilance and the

strengthening of concern to safeguard the security of the land of the sovlets remain

one of the most important tasks to modern times.

Political vigilance is a powerful weapon in the struggle against our adversaries' hostile

Intrigues:

It Is expressed, above all, In the abllity to opportunely expose the enemies.

of the soclalist motherland, however skillfully they may disguise themselves and to

whatever perfidious means and methods they may resort.

Revolutionary vigilance must not be considered in isojation.

It is Indlosolubly linked

with and manifeats itself in organle unity with the uther moral and political qualillea

of the

Soviet person his vivifying Sovlet patrlotism and proletarian internationa11am,

protound devotion to his motherland and the Communist farty, high consciousness and

ideological conviction, organization and discipline, and burning hatred for the enemies

of communism.

At the

all kinds of shortcomings and struggle against the slightest digression from conscientious

rixccution of the Sovlet laws.

At the

time, politloal vigilance

has nothing in common with suspiciousness and

mistrust or with the fanning of spymania, as is widely practiced in capitalist states.

Of course, high moral and political qualities do not come of their own accord. They are

Inculcated in the members of our society in the process of dally educational work.

This

determires the need to strengthen the working people's Ideological and political

education

In the spirit of the CPSV program and the 24th Party Congresa decisions and

In the spirit of the great, all-conquering teaching of Marxlem-Leniniem and of

IndefatIgable revolutionary vigilance.

And the more conscientious every Sovlet person 1s and the higher his political vigilance,

the more reliably the security of our glorious socialist motherland will be insured.
