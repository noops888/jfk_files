MM 105-1742

Based on the information maven owed to date, there
appears to be some indication that this operation was developed
and brought to a head by the efforts of PLACIDO HERNANDEZ.
Considering the mamner in which the Cuban Government was able
to capitalize on the incident from a propaganda standpoint at
a particularly opportune moment during the OLAS conference in
Havana, it is reasonable to suspect that HERNANDEZ delivered !
these men to the Cuban Government just in time to stage a "show":
for the OLAS conference, It is further noted that HERNANDEZ
reportedly was wounded while resisting capture and did not
participate in the interview with the other four prisoners.

It is noted that ARMANDO MONNAR, who was at the meeting
in New York City on 5/15/66, to organize LA REUNION. DEL . PUEBLO
CUBANO, is very likely identical with ARMANDO MONNAR, who arrived
in the United States in November, 1961, and was identified as
a Cuban G-2 agent. It is also noteworthy that MONNAR appeared
to have been a member of the same Cuban intelligence agency as
PLACIDO HERNANDEZ and at the same time,

With regard to ANTONIO LOPEZ OLARRIAGA, also in atten-
dance at the May, 1966, meeting in New York City, as well as
being involved with PLACIDO HERNANDEZ in his activities in Miami,
it is noted that he is under investigation by the Federal Bureau
of Narcotics in connection with a narcotics operation, LOPEZ
is a descri’ | as a Castro sympathizer and is a friend of
BOR: fopnrevayaniA (Bufile 115-639). The Miami file in this
matt dicate $ that interview of LOPEZ could jeopardize this
investigation, and accordingly a lead to interview him is not
being set out at this time.
