COSFDENIAL

Based on the information developed to date,

there

appears to be some indication that this operation was developed

and brought to a head by the efforts of PLACIDO HERNANDEZ.

Considering the manner in which the Cuban Government was able

to capitalize on the incident from a propaganda standpoint at

a particularly opportune moment during the OLAS conference in

these men to the Cuban Government just in time to stage a "show"

for the OLAs conterence.

It is further noted that HErNANDEZ

reportedly was wounded while resisting capture and did not

participate in the interview with the other lour prisoners.

It is noted that ARMANDO MonNAR, who was at the meeting

in New York City on 5/15/66, to organize LA REUNION DEL PUEBLO

CUBANO, is very likely identical with ARMANDO MONNAR, who arrived

in the

United States in November, 1961, and was identified as

a Cuban G-2 agent.

It is also noteworthy that MONNAR appeared

to have been a member of the same Cuban intelligence agency as

PLACIDO HERNANDEZ and at the same time.

With regard to ANTONIO LOPEZ OLARRIAGA, also in atten-

dance at the May,

1966, meeting in New York City,

as well as

being involved with PLACIDO HERNANDEZ in his activities in Miami,

it is noted that he is under investigation by the Federal Bureau

of Narcotics in connection with a narcotics operation.

LOPEZ

is alsó described' as a Castro sympathizer and is a friend of

BORIS RODRIGUEZ SORIA (Bufile 115-639) The Miami file in this

matter indicates that interview of LopEz could jeopardize this

investigation,

and accordingly a lead to interview him is not

being set out at this time.
