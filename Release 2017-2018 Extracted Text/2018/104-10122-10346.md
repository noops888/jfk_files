7. August 27 - Joseph Smith, FE Division, introduced to
Maheu as Joseph Sims.

8. Smith emphasized need for a solid cover story and buck-
stopping. Maheu suggests, in view of Bie close relationship
with movie colony, may induce 2iiii@iidia who represents several
movie interests, to set up an arrangement that would also include
necessary funding mechanisms. :

9. September 23 - Maheu and O'Connell, Security, met with
CitieRew in New York City (Hampshire House). Agreed, if he co-
Operative, would brief him re Agency interest and objective of
Project to get maximum effort from him. He responded enthu-
Siastically and offered his complete service and facilities to sat up
a Secure cover mechanism, He suggasted that GHB be told of
general Governrnent interest (not CLA) at the outset due to her sharp
peresptiveness which may cause her te speculate at a later date,

10, Cover Story - Shag» would commissicn her to perform
ad "on location suryey" in certain FE areas for the proposed ‘iUming
of "Journey to the Center of the Sarth," This could be done very
naturally because e haa the

11, September 23 - @iiiitearrived New York City (St. Regis),
Mabeu met her alone for first time and told her of Government inter-
est. She seemed to ba relieved about certain misgivings she had of
assignment. (She knew true identity of Maheu, having been introduced
to him socially by QUgBRM. She also knew that he had a personal
relations organization. }

12, September 23 (afternoon) -"Mahau introduced "Sims" fo
Wii. Wes given a gracial briefing on assignmont, 4: ermining at +
oes points whether she was still interested. She indicated she z

16, Records of this Office do not reflect any of the activities

of Siti during the courae of har mission, It is believed she left

for Indonesia sometime in January 1959. It is known that she did
meet Sukarno, but dua to unfortunate timing that had him leaving

his country on official business, she had little time to cultivate him;
consequently, the purpose of the mission was not fulfilled. It shonld
be noted that Sukarno took sufficient notice of her that during an ua-
official visit to the United States in June 1959, he expressed a strong
desire to see her and did,

17, The last known contact 30@@iimhad with the agency was in
the form of a telephone call on 12 April 1961 when she called on the
sterile line and talked to Hugh Tovar, who she lmew as George Henry.
She advised that 2M@Stmaietaer asked her to give a party for Presi-
dent Sukarno who would be in Los Angeles on 21 April 1961. She
wanted to know whether Henry's people were interested in sponsor~
ing this party. A negative response was given.

18, It is not known where she is or what her activities are at
the prosent time, but presumably she is still in the Los tngalss
area,
