WE/2 Memo dated 13 December 1963

CONDUCTED ON 25 MAY 197

: IMPDET CL BY 0132

1. In response to referenced request, an original typewritten

letter and envelope addressed to the American Embassy, Stockholm,

were examined in order to determine the origin of the letter and the

nationality of the writer.

2. The following conclusions were drawn concerning the letter

and envelope:

The typewriter in question is equipped with an obsolete

style of German-made type which, according to our references, was

fitted on a number of typewriters made in Germany during the 1920s

and early 1930s.

The possible makes would be Stoever, Torpedo,

Mercedes, Rheinmetall, Urania, Orga, Fortuna, Continental, Kappel,

Groma, Triumph, Merz and possibly some others. Of these makes,

the Torpedo, Mercedes, Rheinmetall and Triumph were probably the

most widely distributed.

b..

The machine in question is equipped with a black and red

ribbon. The keyboard is very probably swedish,

as shown by two

"a strike-overs: umlaut-u for hyphen and "z" for "a". These

characters are adjacent on the standard swedish keyboard, but not

on the German.

The umlaut-a was not used in the street address,

"Strandvagen" (where the dots should have been placed over the

second "a."). This might be either a simple oversight or an attempt

to conceal the writer's familiarity with the correct spelling.

for FOlA Revie

c. The paper of the letter is of the international standard

(DIN) size "A4" which is almost universally used in Sweden. The

linen-textured stationery seems to be rather common in Sweden.

The two smaller pieces of blank paper match the letter paper with

respect to width, thickness, color, texture and look-through, and

were probably cut from another sheet of the same type. The envelope

matches specimens of Swedish envelopes taken from DB/5-Postal

Intelligence files.

a. The letter was posted from the Stockholm Ban post office,

which is located in the central railway terminal in Stockholm.

All mail deposited in street mail boxes in this area or in the post

office would be processed through this station.

e. The cancellation cachet on the envelope is identical in

all respects (format, postmark, number style and length of kille

bars) to exemplars available in our office.

postage the

The postage is correct for Swedish internal mail and the

postage stamp is of current issue.

Go A possible Irregularity is the time lag between the internal

date of the letter, the date of the postmark and the date of receipt

in the American Embassy. The total time from the Internal date of

the letter to the time of receipt is eight days, the time between

the date of posting and the date of receipt is more than three days.

This transit time of more than three days for intra-city mail appears

irregular when compared with the average transit time of only two

three days for arrival between stockholm and the United States.

3. The text of the letter warrants some comments because a number

of peculiarities were noted - aside from pure spelling or typing errors

which seem to indicate a Swedish writer.

The following words represent

either Swedish spelling or modification: "reserv"

', "etablished".

', "murded",

"Krustjev". Other examples of Swedish grammar and syntax would be:

(as past tense),

"In Sowiet" (Swedish form but not spelling),

me was spy" (ithout indestrite article) "outsmented" Suedish penite

article),

"should" (rather than "would"),

participle form), and "whole the world" (pure Swedish form).

4. Another significant detail is the name given, "Ryo Llang Yüan".

"Ryo" is not a standard spelling in any known Romanization system used

for Chinese.

"R" is seen in the new Chinese Communist national system,

but never in combination with "yo". "Ryo" is a Japanese spelling. In

the name given it is not known whether the Chinese or Western presen-

tation is used, in other words, whether "Ryo" or "Yuan" is meant to be

the surname.

Among Chinese syllables which could be represented by the

Liang (IC: 2733) are used as surnames.

Japanese "Pyo" are liao, tolang and Iwal Of these laB yo" is heral

In either case,

a name by which a real Chinese would identify himself.

In summary, and based on the above information, it is concluded

that the letter was transmitted via normal Swedish postal channels. The

letter is probably a "crank letter"

", most likely written by & Swede,

using a Swedish-keyboard typewriter and Swedish stationery.

The• President of the United States of America, John F Kennedy was

assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the government of

the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act alone

but there was helpers and reserv. "Now all is over" was password

to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.

Later he was spy for us. When lee H Oswald had returned to USA we

contacted hin anew and freshened up his minü "you have been a spy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last information in Mexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Kennedy in Mexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as-

ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion was behind the assassin

ation. When Cuba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend

himself. It that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-

ted. We should be allieted with sowiet then we would ask them for A-

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. We and Sowiet should

win this war and whole the world should be Communistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEW WORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled

from our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is achinese spy-shool.
