10 July 1964 \
MEMORANDUM FOR; C/WII/SA
ATTENTION : Mr. Alfonso Rodriguez
FROM : TSD/OA/Special Devices Branch
SUBJECT : Identificatton and Purpose of Contents of

Box marked “Special Fireworks”

1. In response to your request for an evaluation of the
contents of the box marked "Special Fireworks," the following
information and conclusions are offered, ae

2. The nailed plywood box was pried open on 24 June. It
is a kit for making an incendiary device. Contents are six
clear ;iastic, pill type bottles with white plastic tops, filled
with metallic colored powders, a plastic box and lid. Two
bottles are labeled "Continental Plastics Oklahoma City” on the
bottoms, one marked 5 drams, the other, 8 drams, The other four
bottles are not marked with a manufacturer's name but are stamped
"P-7" on the bottoms; one has the numbers 23 and 0 opposite each
other on the bottom, the second has 16 and 0, the third, 10 and 0

and the last, 4 and 0.

3. The box, similar to a soap box, measuring 4" X 25" X 1"
and the lid measuring 4}" X 2-7/8", are either plastic or cellu-
loid. In one end of the box is a round hole sealed on the in-
side by a thin piece of celluloid covered with aluminum foil.

A compartment is formed by a thin piece of celluloid, 7/8” from
the end with the hole, This partition is perforated with several
holes and covered on one side with a layer of aluminum foil. The
lid is perforated with several anoles and sealed on the inside
surface with what appears to te a piece of wide transparent tape.
With the exception of a stamped number "1" on the inside of tke
bottom of the box there are no identifying marks on the box or
lid, From the appearance of the box, covered on the inside

with silvery particles of powder, it must have been loaded at
least once. Glue or rubter cement, probably a sealant with water-



proofing capabilities, vas used to seal the Lid to the box.

4, Four of the plastic bottles are marked with the number
"3" on their tops, one with number “2" and the offer with number
"A", Those marked 3" contain extremely fine silver colored
powder; the one marked "2" slightly coarser silver povder and
the bottle marked "1" a small amount of coarse pale red granules,
All the bottles contain the following substances:

Fe (iron)
K (potassium)
nergy (potassium nitrate)
KC103 (potassium chlorate)
Ke103 (potassium perchlorate)
A trace of Xa * (sodium) is also present in all bottles,

5. The following ratios have been determined:

Bottle #1 Bottle #2 Bottle #3
Fe 1 2 < 3
KNOg 1 1 . 1
KC103 1 2 ” 1
KC10, a 2 " 2

6. Because of the high oxygen content in each of the three
mixtures they obviously are used as first fire mixes. i.e., easily
ignitable substances which in turn can ignite other harder-to-ignite
materials. In this case it appears that an ignition device (a length
of safety fuse or incendiary time pencil) is inserted in the hole
into the emaller compartment. The pale red mixture, tecause of its
relatively high oxygen content, is probably usec as a first fire
mix in this compartment. Mixed with it may be the contents of
vottle number "2", slightly less in oxygen content but higher in
iron and consequently hotter burning, he main cagpartment
would be the contents of bottles number high an costent, hottest
burning of all three mixtures and relatively more <i fticult to ige
nitewere it not for the boost given by the contents of bottle number
"2". As the material in the smaller compartment iszites it burns
through the perforations in the partition ignitinz the contents of
the main compartment, The heat from this combustion melts the tape
covering the perforations in the lid thus allowing oxygen in the air
to aid and accelerate the burning.



7, The device may be used to start fires by surrounding
it vith combustible Secondary media such as paper, oily raczs,
wood shavings, paints and turpentine in a ship's paint locker,
small metal shavings in a machine shop, excelsior in a vare-
house, etc, Only when a sufficient quantity of the secondary
combustible material is burning is there a reasonable chaace
that the primary target «ill be ignited, The device might also
be placed in the seat cushions of an automobile, wecced in a
corner of a vehicle engine or placed in a box of ammunition.

8. There is nothing new in the composition of this device;
it appears to utilize well known principles of incendiary attack
using <ustances that are readily available and proven as depend~
able in;redients. Great care vould have to be exercised in vater-
proofing. an assembled device if it was planned to leave it exposed
for a long period of time; several hours in a hot, damp climate
would be an example of such an exposure, In the absence of actual
field tests it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of
the device: how long it will burn, what proportions of the three
mixtures are most effective, how it performs under various
temperatures and other environmental factors, how it staods up
in storage, ete.

9. When the plywood box was opened it was observed that the
contents were packed in sawdust. Protruding from the saxdust was
a stubbed out filter cigarette, There was no indication of
scorched sawdust.
