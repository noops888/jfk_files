A compartment is formed by a thin piece of celluloid, 1/8" from

the end with the hole.

This partition is perforated

with several

holes and covered on

one side with a layer of aluminum foil. The

lid is perforated with several noles and sealed on the inside

Four of the plastle bottles are marked virs the number

contain extremely fine silver colored

powder; the one marked "2" slightly courser silver porder and

"1" a small anount of coarse pale red granules.

All the bottles contain the followin: substances:

Fe (iron)

K (potassium)

(potassium perchlorate)

A trace of ''a

Because of the high oxygen content in each of the three

mixtures they obviously are used as first fire mixes. 1.e.,

casily

ignitable substances which in turn can ignite other harder-to-ignite

materials fuse

In

this case it appears that an ignition device

(a length

of safety

or incendiary time pencil) is inserted in the hole

into the snaller compartment.

The pale red sixture, because of 1tg

relatively high oxygen content,

is probably usec as a first fire

mix in this compartment.

Mixed with it may be the contents of

slightly less in oxygen content but higher in

iron and consequently hotter burning.

it not for the

boost given by the contents of bottle number

As the material in the smaller compartment icaites it burns

through the perforations in the partition igniting the contents of

the main compartment.

The heat from this combustion melts the tape

covering the perforations

in the lid thus allowing oxygen in the air

to aid and accelerate the burning.

The device may be used to start flies by surrounding

small metal shavings in a machine shop, excelsior in a vare-

house, etc. Only when a sufficient quantity of the secordary

combustible material is buruing is there a reasonable chance

that the primary target rill be ignited.

The device sight also

be placed in the seat cushions of

an automobile, redged in a

corner of a vehicle engine or placed in a box of ammunition.

8. There is nothing new in the composition of this derice:

it appears to utilize well known principles of incendiary attach

using substances that are readily available and proven as depend

able ingredients. Great care vould have to be exercised in sater

proofing an assembled device if it was planned to leave it exposed

for a long period of time; several hours in a hot, damp cliate

would be an example of such an exposure.

mixtures are most effective,

in storage, etc.

When the plywood box was opened it was observed that th

contents were packed in sawdust.
