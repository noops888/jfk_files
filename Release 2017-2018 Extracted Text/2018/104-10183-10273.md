ANALYSIS ABOUT THE POLITICAL INFORMATION WORK:

BACKGROUND:

Thé MeA task presents some deficiencies, undoubtedly a
product of the minimum exploitation of its informative resources
and to the lack of orientation with regard to the information
that is needed.

In M-A we can observe three working zones, each one with

different characteristics: a) MEXICO, b) CENTRAL AMERICA and
c) THE CARIBBEAN. An analysis of each follows.

a) MEXICO

The lack of information about MEXICO and events taking

place there is really alarming. Concretely we can point out
that we do not receive any information about the internal

political situation of Mexico.

This deficiency can be easily overcome if attention is
paid to the orientations of the guidelines and objectives
plan, since the Center in Mexico has contact capabilities
with the political forces of the country, at the necessary
level, it appears, to obtain this type of information,

poner Jee CS-31i1 '00345-64

With regard to the relations with Mexico or the official
policy of the country, we can point out that although the in-
formation received is larger in volume, this work is not ex-
ploiting the information facilities.

Besides. in the first as well as the second case, the
sources available to the Center are not known in the Informa-
tion Service. We can deduce the information capabilities by
analyzing circles or individuals from whom the information is
obtained, However, we don't know what the relations are be-
tween the Center and these informants, therefore we cannot
guide the information collection effort.

b) CENTRAL AMERICA

The information with regard to this region is still
worse than in respect to MEXICO, As far as political ine
formation is concerned, we note the absence of sources
sertaformation and of concrete information about current

matters.

Information about the political life of these countries
is almost nil, especially with regard to current matters. Ins
is ation about political matters is frequently received from
this region, but almost always they refer to reports from @
specific source about his own party or about disagreements,
very generalized, with cther leftist forces.

Lately. for the last three or four months (actually
since early September), a decrease in the total volume of in-
formation received has been observed. especially vith regard
to intelligence information about the national liberation
ovement in Central America. With regard to other matters
(political life, relations with Cuba, solidarity, etc.) the
feet is that we have received information, although very

limited.
c) THE CARIBBEAN

With respect to Santo Domingo and Haiti, we can say
that the job in these two countries is nil, as far as the
collection of information is concerned.

We have only received from Haiti, since the month of
May. two or three information, reports of limited value and
they were received through N-N.

With regard to Santo Domingo the situation is very
similar, Although some information reports have veen re-
ceived, they come from public (overt) sources (newspapers
from progressive organizations, manifests. newspaper clip-
pings. etc.) and occasionally political reports .about
current events and the way of struggle in the country,
drafted by a member of a progressive organization.

ANALYSIS ABOUT INFORMATION ON ENEMY ACTIVITIES WORK:

BACKGROU

About the information work with countries in the M-A
Section with regard to information about counter-revolutionary-
type andagression plans we can point out, in general, its
Principal successes and deficiencies.

Through previous experience and the analysis of informa-
tion received from the countries of this Section concerning
counter-revolutionary activities, it was confirmed once more
that this is the zone preferred by Imperialism for locating
training camps for counter-revolutionary elements, getting
to the point where this assumes serious characteristics in
certain places or specific zones, such as the case of the
Peten zone in Guatemala and Puerto Cabezas and the Maiz Is-
lands in Nicaragua.

From information about this type of activity we can
point out that some was incomplete and fragmentary, observing
in many cases the absolute lack of exploitation of a source;
this fact meant from the standpoint of our work serious dif.
ficulties. since this limited considerably our possibilities
of indirect confirmation, that is, through other different
Sources. as well as a series of derivative difficulties such
as the lack of continuity in the information, lack of con=
firmation, lack of contact and guidance as to the source

objectives, etc,

Analyzing all these previous phenomena we can point
out a definite guideline with regard to our work for this
Section during the forthcoming year, this guideline would
cover the following aspects that will be basic from the
standpoint of aggression plans,

1. Location of training camps for Cuban mercenaries,
conclusion as to the type of training they get and their
number, as well as their resources,

2. Detection of enemy aggression plans through the
Armed Forces of Central American

countries and through the so-much mentioned collective action,
or something similar, :

3. Location of vperations bases for pirate launches and
counter-revolutionary groups that will operate from nearby
countries. This is directly related with the plans for
Penetrating the enemy.

4. Penetrate and have full information about enemy's anti-
guerrilla plans and its development. These would be the tasks
to be developed during the year, accordingly, and following
the general guidelines and objectives of the current work.
