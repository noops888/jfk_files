EMPLÖYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that 1 intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations•

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the fBl or information I may acquire as an employee of the fBl could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

. Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed *

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBi and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

masterial relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

MR. TOLSON:

• The attached analysis of

¡Communism and the Negro Movement is

(highly explosive. It can be regarded as

a personal attack on artin Luthering.

il There is no doubt it will have a heavy

impact on the Attorney General and anyone

else to whon ve cisseminate it.

It is

labeled TOP SECKET. However, even such a

high classification seems to be no bar

today to a leak, and should this leak out

it will add fuel to a matter which may

already be in the cards as a political

issue during the forthcoming Presidential

campaign.

The memorandum makes good reading and

His based on information from reliable sources.

tHe may well ve charged, however, with

expressing opinions and conclusions, parti

cularly with reference to some of the

statements about king.

We must do

our duty. H

This memorandum may sinsule the Attorney

General, particularly in view of his past

association with king, and the fact that we

are disseminating this outside the Department.

He may resent

this.

Memorandum

TO

Mr. BELMONT

DATE: Cctober 25, 1963

FROM :

C. A. EVANS

SUBJECT:

COMMUNISM AND THE

NEGRO MOVEMENT

The Attorney General telephoned at approximately a. a.m.

He advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of

, the building. The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Limy

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about the

communist activities of vartin Isther King. The attorney. Genera was reic, tap

to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Current.

Analyses, " dated October 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report

to which he is referring. although he persisted on calling it the report on the

/communist background of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney General said he would like to know what other

dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose

for such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to ask if the •

'Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I tolà the Attorney General that

obviously the

Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not

concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's persona?

attention. I yointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

in matters of current interest under our internal, Security jurisdiction, and that

dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well

as other top governmental oificials because of responsibilities they have in this

connection.

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney

General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communist

lactivities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be

called on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability

•of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.' The Attorney General

said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's

communist activities. He reiterated nis request for information as to the dissemina

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it.

This memorandum recommends that the National Sclence

Foundation (NST) be furnished information concerning the

communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCIC) and its President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr:

This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by the

NSE for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools:

has furnished information that

was advised that the NSF

desired qualified applicants to enter the University of

and other schools in southern states where the NST has its

was advised that the fist was

contacting organizations such as the SCIC and othei civil

rights

grouns to magdie tie recritment program for Negro studenis since

they did not want it to appear that the Nsf was attempting ta

put Negro applicants in southern schools.

was advised that each qualified applicant

Fould receive a $3,000 scholarship fron the NSI, Since this

is a Government project any expenses incurred in this matter

"would not come out of anyone's pocket."

This would idicate

that any expenses incurred by the SCIC in their recruitment

effort would be paid for with Government funds.

To obtain approval to disseminate monograph

"Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current

Analysis" to the United States Ambassador to Japan,

U. Alexis Johnson.

BACKGROUND:

On my recent inspection of the Legal Attache office

in Japan, I met and talked with Ambassador Jonnson. Juring

our conversation, it was quite apparent that Ambassador

Johnson was unaware of the communist influence being exerted

on Martin Luther King, Jr., and his group the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference.

In November of 1964, interested officials of the

Government, including the Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary Of

State, were furnished copies of the monograph

entitled,

'Communism and the Negro Movement, - A Current Apalysis

It is felt that Ambassador Johnson, because of his

position, should be made aware of communist infiltration into

King's group, and the influence being exerted on King.

Ambassador Johnson is a former Deputy Secretary of

. State and has been extremely cooperative and

helpful in the:

communist influence in the Negro movement. Emphasis was

King, Jx., as well as facts relating to his immoral nature.

As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of

U, S. Goverment are Involved. The Atlanta Office has

recommended that

be

advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable

since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only aggravate the racial suation that exists in the

south.

It is felt that Di. Leland J. Haworth, Director,

Nst, should be furnished infornation regarding communist

influences exerted on the SCIC and King. In this rogard

we recently disseminated to the White House and the

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

summary entitled "Conmunism and the legro lovement--A

Current

Analysis" which contains information regarding the

SCIC and King.

this summary deals with King's communist

connections and his personal immoial activities. "ith the

receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCIC would

undoubtedly be removed from thn NSF

nrogram to obtain qualified

Regro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation

in the NSF program is being sepazately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies.

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to

F.) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) - DOMESTIC CONTACT

SERVICE -- You previously have been informed regarding CIA's Contact

Division which has had offices in various U. S. cities and which is openly

identified as being connected with CIA. This division has been responsible

• for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of

aliers, travelers, businessmen. etc. The division has not been engaged

in any operational activity such as the development of double agents. For

your information, CIA has reorganized this division and it is now called

the Domestic Contact Service.

An examination of CIA s activities in the area of overt collection

o1 positive intelligence has indicated that the Bureau can strengthen its

position by having our field offices establish direct contact with the local

oifices of the Domestic Contact Service. This particularly applies to those

situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc

and lugoslav nationals, excluding those who are connected with embassies

or the United Nations. We recognize that CIA has a responsibility for.

collection of positive intelligence (i. e. information regarding Soviet-bloc

capability in a particular research field) which might be acquired from

such risitors hut we cannot condone any CIA actirity which might

interfere with Bureau operations. - You therefore are authorized to

Dear Mr. Cutler:

under seal, no official or employee of the Depart-

ment will have access to them foi any purpose, and

no official or employee of the Department will

3.

Should some future need which we do not now

aforesaid

items, tle decision on such"accéss shall

Although this arrangement is not intendea to

you have raised concerning these documents, it

will not be rescinded or modified by the Attorney •

General or his successors unless the Attorney Gen-

eral gives Mr.. Kraft or his counsel ten days'

UBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA

Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70. I made the

statement, "Unfortunately., CIA also belieres that in the past

we did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency

undoubtedly could present a list of grievances." It is my

understanding that you want such grievances identified. There•

1s enclosed herewith'a list of cases or situations which arose

over the years.

Based upon a revier of files and my personal recollectio=

this list would

be representative of matters which CIA could use

for making charges such

aS:

not being forthright, not playing

fairly and squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,

not recognizing the

need for concrete FBI contributions to the

foreign intelligence effort.

What CIA may have compiled over the i

years is unknown.

What situations are known to CIA and have not

come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am

thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have

been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants

and sources;

It should be clearly emphasized that there is no

indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking

say kind of a showdown or confrontation with the FBI. Contrary,

to what some people may believe, the relationship between the

two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite

the problems which have arisen from time to time. I am contident

that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively

support the foregoing

In order that there may not'be any misunderstanding, it

is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an

extensive list of justified grievances. We can also produce an'

excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably

CIA could do the same.

There are ingredients for continuing

conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining

sound working relations and producing badly. needed intolligence

information.

I belleve that it would be most helpful to you and

interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment

on the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role

of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple

mail courier or he can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront

any problem or issue with another-gency, very often working with

very limited information. .It is expected that the Bureau Agent

carry out his instructions forcefully and efficiently. He must

be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various

conditions. He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself

in a most judicious and prudent manner but

always making certain

that the Bureau position

Is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,

it should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were

easy to handle because the Agent had f. Edgar Hoover behind him.

However, when an Agent struck at:an official on one day and

solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some

resourceful action.

It is believed that other liaison Agents

regularly encounter similar situations.

On numerous occasions

I have bittorly feuded with CIA officials and this las included

rough language. I have walked out on CIA officials when I felt

they were unreasonable. They took the initiative by asking the

Agent to return.

I did try to play fairly and squarely with all

of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this includ.

the Director of the Agency.

I lectured to CIA personnel

over the years I always made a point to challenge them to present

any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the

• Bureau. I never left a discussion with any CIA official without

'being positive that our position was absolutely understood..

The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism.

I believe

the Bureau's position is most favorable. I don't think CIA has

eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment.

INVOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE

• CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

(1) MOCASE. (THE BORIS MORROS CASE) •

This was a sensitive Soviet-espionage case

which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most

part in 1957.

The case had many wide loreign ramifi-

cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly

will be, one of the most important. and involved cases

of Soviet operations in this country and abroad.

He

did not disseminate any iniormation of significance

In this case until 1954. On various occasions when

the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu

ments with CIA officials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

cooperate with the Agency. The position taken by CIA

was that it should have been advised regarding the

Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,

claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity

to develop more information of significance, identify

Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for

recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. He did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

extreme sensitivity of the case.

We actually did not

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

the HOCASE until 1957.

....

In 1957, CIA complained that 1t certainly had

every right to have received the information earlier

because many aspects of the locasE pertained to CIA

employees and operations. CIA further argued that it

had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out

the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the

Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.

The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to

coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case

permitted the French, rather than the U. S., to play a

doninating role in Europe.

With regard to dealing with the French, we

took the position that we would cover the leads through

our Legal Attaches wherever possible and to furnish

leads to CIA in those countries where we did not have

Legal Attaches. CIA maintained that since we were on

record that our legal Attaches do not handle operations

abroad, the Bureau had an obligation to levy those French

leads on CIA or at least coordinate with the Agency.

It is to be noted that in any argument relating

to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA will fall back on the

responsibilities placed on the Agency under the provisions

of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation

of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc

tives. CIA will maintain that' it is incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security

CIA complained that

many Of the visitors left most disappointed because they

had not had any contact with any Bureau officials. CIA

felt that contact with Bureau officials had very

significant

benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of

the FBI's worldwide reputation.

CIA also pointed out that

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,

they were left with

the suspicion that there was some kind

of friction between the FBI and CIA..

In 1956, we had a

clear-cut policy to the effect that

tours for

visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

(7) CIA - DUTCH INTEREST IN SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY

In 1965, the. Dutch Internal

Security Service

was in the process of investigating individuals in

Holland who allegedly had been engaged in Soviet-espionage

activity. The Dutch wanted to have certain individuals

in the U. S. Interviewed and approached CIA to make

inquiry at the Bureau. At that time, our relations

with the Dutch had been practically nonexistent because

the Dutch had failed to honestly deal' with us in the

case of

the Agency that

(12) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL -

In YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused

our Legal Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert

intelligence activity "of a nature which I believe

exceeds his terms of reference."

The Ambassador further

indicated that CIA was unhappy over -the Legal Attache's

activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador

that the Legal Attache had disseminated information from

& source who was a fabricator or a provocator.

This

situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches

operation of an informant in Brazil:

Some of the

Information that he received from the informant was

of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who

was being touted as a Presidential candidate.

CIA

asked for the identity of the informant and we told

the Agency that the person could not be identified

because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed.

This case is being cited because CiA may have evidence

that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi-

nated pursuant to Directives, and that

the matter vas

further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability

of the information.

that Agency's efforts to collect sensitive information

quarters was highly disturbed because its office in pLAcE

had not been cut in on this operation and the Agency wanted

SE CHE

determined that the Legal Attachehad made inquiries in

PLACE in response to leads which had been sent from Bureau

Headquarters.

This matter is being highlighted because

•It was a vitally important operation to CIA and the Agency

had received indications that information had been leaked

tO FOREIGN

authorities. We have no evidence or reason to

believe that the Legal Attache Office ever involved itself

in any such leak.

However, we should not, under any cir-

cumstances, discount the fact that CIA has penetrated

FoReIGu services and has had access to sensitive information

In PLACE

The FoREIGN have always had an outstanding cap-

ability of tapping phones and installing microphones in

PLACE

Such coverage on U.S. officials;

including their

residences, should never be excluded. The information we

had conveyed to our Legal Attache possibly may have been

acquired by the FoREIGN through clandestine coverage. CIA

possibly could charge us with

handling their sensitive

Information in an insecure manner by'fransmitting it to

PlacE without conferring with the Agency.

In connection with alleged Forelay espionage

activity in the U.S., CIA has never been satisfied with

the efforts made by the Bureau.

The Agency possibly could

take the position that we looked lightly at the allegations

and did not pursue a matter which, in their eyes, merited

a more aggressive approach.

For some time, CIA has held to

, a position that

the FOREIGN Intelligence Service NAME

is penetrated by

the soviets.

The Agency has pointed out that if the ForeIGN,

are collecting sensitive information in the U. S., the

product is ending up in Moscow. • In January, 1964,, we

reviewed the status of our investigation of FOREIGN

intel-

ligence activities in the U. S. The Director commented

"I think this whole thing has been imaginary on the part

in the

of CIA which has been played as a sucker by NAME

I.would waste no more time on it at least until all CIA

restrictions are removed." CIA did impose restrictions

by not permitting us to pursue certain leads because it

In September, 1965, we received information

Indicating that oneof our informants on the Mexican border

was in a position to travel- to Cuba. A question was raised

concerning CIA interest in this matter, 1f the informant

made the trip. It was recommended and approved that we

not advise CIA concerning the identity of the informant

period. We told CIA we had no informants available

because they were necessary for our own operations.

We

took the position that we saw no benefit to be gained by

loaning an informant on a short or long term basis.

This item is being mentioned because Africa

has become vitally important to U. S.. interest, bearing

In mind that both the soviets and Chinese Communists have

made significant inroads into the area.

CIA could argue

that as early as 1960, it had the foresight to recognize

the need for additional coverage, that it appealed to the

sureau for assistance, and that we did not cooperate.

(32) VICE PRESIDENT NIXON'S TRIP TO SOUTR AMERICA - 1958

In 1958, Vice President Richard M. Nison traveled

to Latin America during which time there were numerous riots

and attacks which were directed against the Vice President

jand his party: By letter dated May 16, 1958, we provided

the Vice President with a summary of information which we

had received concerning the events in Latin America relating

Most of this information came from CIA.

Our letter could be interpreted as raising, the question

concerning the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

of the referenced communication. As already indicated,

we do know that CIA personnel have been assigned to the

White House.

We also know that

If CIA is cognizant of the connunication, the

For many years, we maintained tight restrictions

with regard to the exchange of technical information with

CIA, particularly as it related to the technical surveillance

field.

CIA exhibited its equipment to us but, for many years,

SECREI

CIA never made any official protest but informally

Indicated from time to time that the lack of exchange

in this highly important field was prejudicial to over-

all intelligence and internal security interests. The

Agency implied that we actually were nore open with the

British in this general area than we were with

CIA.

It should be noted that the foregoing situation

does not exist today. There is good exchange between the

Bureau and CIA.

(35) CIA LECTURERS AT BUREAU TRAINING SCHOOLS

CIA has never been able to understand why the

Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to lecture at Bureau

schools or training courses. CIA has felt that through

a careful

selection of lecturers, the Agency could make

a very valuable contribution both to the Bureau and to

CIA.

The Agency has indicated that its participation in

some of our courses mould give the Agency the opportunity

to deccribo CIA's organization, obicatives, and operational

problems. Furthermore, it has

been expressed that Bureau

personnel could be given the opportunity to pose questions

and there would be a far better over-all orientation on

the

part of our people.

The Liaison Agent has always resisted CIA's

request.

It has been a delicate matter to handle because

Bureau personnel have lectured to hundreds of CIA employees.

(36) EXCHANGE IN THE TRAINING FIELD

Although CIA has never officially made an issue

of the matter, the Agency has not been happy about our

attitude concerning exchange of information in the training

field. When the matter has been broughtup for any discussion.

by CIA, the Agency has been discouraged.

CIA informally has

expressed the feeling that an exchange along certain guide-

lines could be most useful to the U.S. intelligence and

internal security effort.

This is an area where discussion with CIA

officials can rapidly generate criticisn of the Bureau

tance lure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis?

Positive intelligence, briefls, is that information

which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating

foreign policy.. Much' of it is of a political nature and

& vital portion pertains to scientific developments, military

capabilities of foreign countries, and intentions of foreign

countries. Positive intelligence

is rot only important

as it concerns the communist-bloc countries but also

the non-bloc nations.

There never has been any 'lay, Directive, or

Executive Order which has fixed the responsibilities for

the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in

the U.S. The Bureau does have a responsibility which

we refer to as internal security and shich falls into the

accepted area of counterintelligence. He do investigate

subversives spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign

intelligence services.

Our work in the positive intelli

gence field, for the most part, has been restricted

tO

the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the state

Department, usually when a political crisis occurs in

some country.

• CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous

unexplored

field for expanded acquirement of

positive

intelligence in the U.S.

This would mean vastly increased

technical surveillance coverage,

, development of informants,

and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not

feel that we have aggressively moved on this particular

subject and that over the years, the gency has been

thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

In DATE

, CIA requested the Bureau to

by the Bureau as unfriendly and uncooperative. The agency

has looked to the Bureau as the logical point of contact and

as the only organization having the resources and capabilities

of adequately determining if such coverage is even feasible.

(38) MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

The Liaison Agent recalls fragments of other

situations or conflicts which occured over the years and

which resulted in the voicingol CIA displeasure of criticism.

The Agent cannot recall the names of the cases which is

necessary to acquire the required data. There was one

Instance early in the 1950's which involved information

received from a source of unknown reliability charging

Allen Dulles with having

been a communist and a spy while

In Europe.. We disseminated the information to several

agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

The Agent also has recollection of instances when

CIA alleged that its source or informant was compromised by

Bureau revelation of CIA information during the course of

Interviews conducted by us. Technically, this would be a

violation of the third agency rule and, if CIA had hard

core facts, we would be vulnerable, particularly it an

: Honorable Richard Helms.

Director

Cashing in, i gence Agency

Dear Mr. Helms:

As I am sure you will agree, the need for close

coordination of the intelligence-gathering ansfounter-

Intelligence efforts of the rBi and the Central Intelligence

тона

Agency (CIA) is self-evident. This

matter. is one which

requires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies

have established working agreements whereby we can most

effectively realize positive results with a minimum of

duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of the CIA to consider coordina-

tion of our mutual efforts in the collection of positive

intelligence in the United States. As a result of these

conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn.up and agreed

to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted

In my letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director

Vice Admiral William F. Reborn, JI. A copy of the agreement

is enclosed for your information. ' This agreement has proven

generally effective and no major problens have been

encountered since its adoption in the areas it covers.

=.. The FBI has primary responsibility with regard to

matters involving the internal security of the United States

as well as for conducting counterintelligance operations in

this country, While this Bureau does not have any statutory

responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign

Intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential

for the development of such intelligence in this country 1s

considerable.

The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort

to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

=: Intelligence agencies, including the CIA, and policy-making

officials of the Government. While these efforts have,

of course, been incidental to our main internal security

and counterintelligence responsibilitles, we have on a

selective basis developed sources, both live and technical,

providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the

United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished

on a regular basis to the CIA and other interested agencies

aù officials uf the Guverimeni.

I know that you will share my belief that this

matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the

national security interests continue, to be servad in the

most effective and complete manner possible. After revieving

this matter, including the attached 1966 agreement, I-would

walcome any observations you may desire to make.

sincerely yours,

J. Edgar Hoover
