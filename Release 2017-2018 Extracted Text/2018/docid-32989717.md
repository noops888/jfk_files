EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United
States Department of dustice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare
that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as
= Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the ©
President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations-
toe issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal
Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-
authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other
classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of
the FBI;

(2) Lunderstand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files
of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could
result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or
result in the denial of due process to a person-or persons who are subjects
of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its
responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-
fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,
publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other-means disclose to
any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the
_Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory
files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the
performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden
is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed
and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each
such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to :
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand .
that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed ~ i: i
in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but
it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be
contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is
in a better position than I to make that determination;
_ (8) Lagree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official
duties with the FBi and all official material to which I have access:remains
the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand
by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any
uiterial relating to such information or property in my possession; 7
(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal
law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may
be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.
I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment
in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment i in the FBI and
following termination of such employment.

A CURRENT ANALYSIS ">
: E : : . i

The enclosed article, captioned as above,.is the

one we have been preparing in line with approval of our
recommendation to disseminate it on - select basis at a
very high level to show current con ities in
relation to the Negro | movement. It incozporstes up-
material just received from our New York Office relat
to the recent meeting of the Communist Party's National

|| Executive Committee. Discussion of racial matters was a

‘\ primary topic at the week-long meeting.

The enclosed article is a factual; documented
| analysis of the over-all current: situation. We believe :
i that it would be of interest not only to the Attorney General
t but also to Mr.:O'Donnell, at the White House; Mr. MeCone at
i the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Dep
te - of State; as well as to Mr. McNamara ‘and the three Armed Forces
: intelligence agencies of the Defenge Department. Accordingly,
if the article as prepared is _ approved, we propose to
seminate it to. the afore-ment Givi. ¥

Memorandum

To Lisseuet “MR, BELMONT pate: Cctober 25, 1963
“FROM: c. A, EVANS 2 :
SUBJECT: “COMMUNISM ANDTHE ‘°

NEGRO MOVEMENT . 7

The Attorney General telephoned atapproxiniately 10:15 a. m.
He advised that he had'tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of
bes building, The Attorney General stated he had just learned thai the &:

chad received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about the
communisi activities of Martin Iuther King, The Attorney.G
to the report captioned *Communism and the Negro Movement -- A :
Analyses," cated Cctober 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report:
to which he is referring, although he persisted on calling it the report onthe
Jcommunist background of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney General said he would like to know what other
dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the burpose’
for‘sech dissemination. He was cbviously irritated. He went on to ask if the
‘Army got copies of all reports stbmitied to him. I told the Attorney General that

obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not

concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's personal
attention. I pointed out to him that We regularly submitted some type of reports
\in matters of. current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction, and that
{dissemination of these summaries was made to thie milita: ary authorities as well

as other top governmental officials pete of responsibilities they have in this
[esneston :

{

The Attorney General asked what “responsibilities the Army had in
trelation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney
General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communist

activ: ities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to b

tealled'on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability
‘of the civilian authorities. -

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.’ The Attorney General
said he still could not understand why we sent a report io the Army on King's’ ” :
ycommunist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the Gissenmiine

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it.

PURPOSE:

7 To obtain approval.to disseminate “monograph
entitled, "Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current
Analysis" to the’ United States Ambassador to Japan,
U. Alexis’ Johnson,

BACKGROUND:

On my recent inspection of the Legal Attache office
‘in Japan, I met and talked with Ambassador Jonnson, wvuring
our conversation, it was quite apparent that Ambassador
Johnson was unaware of the communist influence being exerted
| .on Martin Luther King, Jr., and his group the: Southern
| + ° Christian Leadership Conference.
jes 7
JESEEreEee In November of 1964, interested officials of the
‘Government, including the Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary of
fiom were furnished copies of the monograph entitled,
“‘Communism and the Negro Movement - A current Analysis. "

Sst denty nF

It is felt that Ambassador. Johnson, because of “his
position, should be made aware of communist infiltration into
King's group, and the influence being exerted on King.

‘Memorandum
TO : Mr. W. C. Sullivan : Date: March 23, 1965

FROM : Mr, F, J. Baumgardner

SUBJECT "COMMUNISM AND THE NEGRO
MOVEMENT--A CURRENT ANALYSIS"

You will recall that in December, 1964, with the
Director's approval and after first checking with the White
‘House, we disseminated to the Heads of the intelligence
community a paper’ captioned as above which depicted the
communist influence in the Negro movement. Emphasis was
given in the paper to the communist influences on Martin Luther
King,Jr., as well as facts relating to his immoral nature.
an As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of
Florida, is Director, Community Relations Service (CRS),
Departiient of Commerce, aud inthis posiiiuu serves as something
‘of a "mediator" in problems relating to the racial field. He
has been a key individual relative to the situation in Selma,
Alabama. Information of interest. to the CRS is regularly being
disseminated to that agency. [ive just received reliable infor-
mation concerning a conversation between Martin Luther King, Jr.
and his wife, Coretta, ‘Quring which Coretta made reference to
the Selma situation and said that Colljns was blinded by

- prejudice. We have disseminated the information concerning
the King co. i

age

It is believed that, in view of Collins' important
position relative to the racial movement, he should have
benefit of the paper which we have already given to the
White House and the Heads of the intelligence community, Our rela-’
tions with Collins have been friendly; he is a long-time admirer of

an It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,

sr, should be furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCLC and King, In this regard
we recently disseminated to the White House and the :
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"
summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Movenent--A 7

a : CIA continues to be one of the most’
important liaison assignzents as well as one of the most time
consuming. Proper handling of this assignment now requires the
full time and tention of 4 Liaison Supervisor and it is believed
that SA Papich should be relicved of his INS assignment in order

) “CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) - DOMESTIC CONTACT

SERVICE -- You previously have been informed regarding CIA’s Contact
"+ Division which has had offices in.various U. 8. cities and which is openly
identified as being connected with CIA. This division has been responsible
for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of
aliens, travelers, businéssmen. etc. The division has not been engaged
in any operational activity such as the development of double agents. For
your information, CIA has reorganized this division and it is now called
the Domestic Contact Service. : ~

An examination of CIA s activities in the area of overt collection
of positive intelligence has indicated that"the Bureau can strengthen its
position by having our field offices’ establish direct contact with the local
offices of the Domestic Contact Service. This:particularly applies to those
Situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc
and Yugoslav nationals, excluding those who are connected with embassies
or the United Nations. We recognize that CIA has a responsibility for
collection of positive intelligence (i.e. information regarding Soviet-bloc

_ Capability in a particular research field) which might be acquired from
such tors hnt we cannot condone any CIA activity which might
interfere with Bureau operations. - You therefore are authorized to
establish liaison with local offices of the Domestic Contact Service.

In each’case when you initiate any inquiry or investigation of a visiting
Soviet-bloc national, you should obtain from the local Domestic Contact
Service the nature and extent of CIA interest and all pertinent information
which CIA has gained or may acquire in the fuiure relating to our internal
security responsibilities. If you feel that CIA activity conflicts with
Bureau objectives, you should so advise the Seat-of Government, clearly
setting forth your reasons. In this connection, there may be instances -
where continuing CIA pursuit of positive intelligence would conflict with
the Bureau s discharge of its internal security functions. -

: Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70. I made the
statement, "Unfortunately, CIA also believes that in the past
we did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency
undoubtedly couid present a list of grievances." it is my
understanding that you want such grievances identified. There
is enclosed herewith a list of ‘cases or, situations which arose
over the years.

a : Based upon a review of files’ and my. personal recollectioz
this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use
for making charges such as: not being forthright, not playing
fairly and squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,

not recognizing the need for concrete FBI contributions to the
foreign intelligence effort, What CIA may have compiled over the i
years is unknown, What situations are known to CIA and have not
come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am
thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have
been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants’
-8nd sources,

It should be clearly emphasized that there is no
indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking
any kind of a showdown or confrontation with the FBI. Contrary ,
to what some people may believe, the relationship between the

two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite

the problems which have arisen from time to time, I am confident
that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively

- support the foregoing. : :

In order that there may not“ be any misunderstanding, it
is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an
extensive list of justified grievances. We can also produce an
excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably
CIA could do the same. There are ingredients for continuing e
conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining

sound working relations and producing badly. needed intelligence

_ Memorandum to th Director aeiat :
“RE: RELATIONS % e CIA rex eri e
—,

I believe that it would be most helpful to you ana
interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment
on the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role
of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple
mail courier.or he can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront
any problem or issue with anotheragency, very often working with
very limited information. .It is expected that the Bureau Agent
carry out his instructions forcefully and efficiently. He must
be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various
conditions. He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself
in a most judicious and prudent manner but always making certain
that the Bureau position is well fortified.

: In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,
it should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were
easy to handle because the Agent had J. Edgar Hoover behind hin.
However, when an Agent struck at:an offjcial on one day and
“solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some
resourceful action. It is believed that other liaison Agents
regularly encounter similar situations. On numerous occasions
i-have bittorly feuded h-CIA officials and this has .included
rough language. I have walked out on CIA officials when I felt
they were unreasonable, They took the initiative by asking the
Agent to return, I did try to play fairly and squarely with all
of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this includ:
the Director of the Agency. When'I lectured to CIA personnel
over the years I always made a point to challenge them to present
any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the

‘Bureau. I never left a discussion with any CIA official without
“being positive that our position was absolutely understood.

The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism. I

can only refer, to the records of the Bureau and CIA and I believe
the Bureau's position is most favorable, I don't think CIA has
ever transmitted a letter of protest to the Bureau during the
eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment.

(1) HOCASE. “(THE BORIS MORROS CASE) .
. This was a sensitive Soviet~espionage case

which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most
part in 1957,. The case had many wide foreign ramifi-
cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly
will be, one of the most important.and involved cases
of Soviet operations in this country and abroad. We
did not disseminate any information of significance

in this case until 1954. On various occasions when
the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu~
ments with CIA officials, they have seen fit to raise
this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to
cooperate with the Agency, The position taken by CIA
Was that it should have been advised regarding the
Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,
Claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity
to develop more information of significance, identify
Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for
recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. We did
not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the :
extreme sensitivity of the case. We actually did not ;
permit CIA to handle any investigations oe to a
the eat until 1957.

In 1957, CIA ‘complained that it certainly had
every right to have received the information earlier
because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA
employees and operations. “CIA further argued that it
had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out
the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the
Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.
The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to
coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case
permitted the French, rather than the U 7 Ss to play a
dominating role in Europe.

leads to CIA in those countries where we did not have

‘Legal Attaches, CIA maintained that since we were on

record that our Legal Attaches dq not handle operations
abroad, the Bureau had an obligation ‘to levy those French
leads on CIA or, at least. coordinate with the Agency |
before going to the French.

It is ‘to be noted that in any argument relating
to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA-will fall back on the
responsibilities placed on the Agency under the provisions
of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation
of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc-
tives, CIA will maintain that’ it is-<incumbent upon the
Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security
Act of 1947 and the Directives. The Agency would argue

j Shae in the HOCASE, these were ignored by the Bureau.

Although CIA has-not raised the point for
several years, the prevailing attitude was, and probably
still exists, that the FBI did not play it square with
CIA in the Abel case py not making certain that the
|Agency was given the proper recognition for its contri-
butions, CIA feels that im the first place,” there would
not have been any U. S. access or availability to the
source in this case, NAME: . because CIA took
the full responsibility for’ moving NAME trom PLACE
to the U. S, in 1957, CIA claims it took the risk and
responsibility of doing this after the Bureau declined
to become involved in any operation designed to transport
"NAME to the.U. S. It should be noted that NAME
Was an alcoholic and that his first contacts with CIA
in /LAce raised questions concerning NAMWE | mental —§.*.

After MAME arrived in the U. S., we
arranged access to him for 2 period, the purpose of
which was to obtain a complete story of his intelli-

jeence activities in the U. S, and we were particularly
i}interested in identifying all of his associates, es~
‘Ypecially the man who later was identified as Rudolph

was a moSt fortunate arrangement’as far as‘CIA was con~
cerned, because this adjustment gave us the time to work
with NAME ‘and subsequently develop the leads which
wjled’ to the apprehension of Abel, The Agency has main-
" tained that it was largely responsible for making
absolutely certain that MANE was mentally and
physically prepared for testimony at.the Abel trial.
NAHE -was a.key witness. CIA has- also referred to
the heavy expenses incurred by the Agency, all for the
benefit of the Bureau, CIA has complained that the -
Bureau never really thanked the Agency for its coopera~
tion and CIA has been particularly irked becaused the
Bureau did not see fit to inform the Attorney General
ior the White House of the role played by CIA.

the information to the White House, the Attorney General,

i “fand some data also went to the State Department. Dulles

took theposition that by disseminating derogatory in-

formation concerning his Agency, He had been placed on -

the spot because the | WAME . data was not the

complete story, In the past, CIA informally referred

to this as an ‘instance of very unfair conduct on the part

of the Bureau. . i : :

(6) BUREAU HANDLING OF CIA REQUESTS FOR ‘TOURS

FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS

cd e

On occasions in the 1950's,” CIA complained that

officials visiting the U.
given excellent treatment
many. of the visiters left

S, under CIA sponsorship were
on the tour but, nevertheless,
most diseppointed because they

had not had any contact with any Bureau officials, CIA
felt that contact with Bureau officials had very significant
benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of
the FBI‘s world-wide reputation. CIA also pointed out that
hen foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,
they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind
of friction between the FBI and CIA. In 1956, we had a
clear-cut policy to the effect that tours for such visi-

tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such
wisitors would view our facilities normally seen by the
ublic and nothing more. CIA was so informed but

‘seney on indicated that our policy prevented the

gency from truly enhancing U. S. interests abroad,
IA never lodged an official complaint.

T {It should beenphasized that for the past several

‘years there would not be any basis for any formd complaint
.with regard to Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming
‘to the U. S. under CIA sponsorship. The personal attention
-igiven to such officials by NANE. and
j other officials and Supervisors in the Domestic Intelligence
Division has been outstanding and benefits have accrued to

‘the Bureau, These visitors have gone back to their native

(7) CIA ~ DUTCH INTEREST IN SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY —

In 1965, the. Dutch Internal Security Service
was in the process of investigating individuals in
Holland who allegedly had been engaged in Soviet-espionage
activity. The Dutch wanted to have certain individuals
in the U0, S. interviewed and approached CIA to make
inquiry at the Bureau. At that time,-our relations
with the Dutch had been practically nonexistent because
the Dutch had failed to honestly deal’ with.us in the
Gase of WVAME AWD |DEVTIFYING DATA who had been
iclandestinely collecting intelligence at the National
Security Agency. when CIA approached us, we-told
‘the Agency that the Dutch could submit their request
through-diplomatic channels. We subsequently told CIA
we would not handle the interviews for the Dutch, We
stuck to our position. CIA.surrendered but felt that

(10) INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

During the 1950's, we gave our Legal Attaches
numerous leads stemming from internal security cases in
the U. S.. In many instances we did not see fit to
notify CIA although the Agency always maintained that
you could not separate "internal Security" from “counter-
intelligence,"’namely a lead in France pertaining to a
communist in the U. S. warranted advising CIA, if not,
at least asking the Agericy to handlé the. tead. In the
last several years, it is not believed that there is
any basis for complaint since we have regularly been
notifying CIA concerning subjects of cases who travel
abroad, If the Legal Attache is investigating, CIA is
notified in order to avoid duplicate efforts. There
have been exceptions where we have taken the position
that CIA should not be notified bec¢ause of the sensitivity
of the matter, How many such exceptions are known to
CIA cannot be established from our files; however, we
should benr in mind that.when onr Legal Attaches inves~. .
tigate, they contact many of the same foreign officials
normally contacted by CIA. How many of these foreign
officials are CIA informants,or on the Agency payroll,
is unknown,

(11) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN CUBA ~

: We operated informants in Cuba when we had a
Legal Attache's Office in Havana, Informants reported
on activities of communists and other subversives in
that country, During the period we operated these
informants, we did not coordinate our operations with
CIA. We did not advise: the Agency that we had such
sources, However, in 1960, after Castro’. came on the
scene, it became infeasible to handle certain informants
in a secure manner, Approval was granted to turn certain
informants over to CIA, What these informants may have
subsequently told CIA about past Bureau operations is
unknown. This item is being cited in the event CIA had
evidence to establish that we had been operational in
Cuba and had not coordinated with the Agency pursuant
to Directives.

(12) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL ~

t

| : In YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused
our Legal Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert
intelligence activity “of a, nature which I believe

_ exceedS his terms of reference." The Ambassador further
indicated that. CIA was unhappy over the Legal Attache's
activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador
that the Legal Attache had disseminated information from
® source who was a fabricator or a provocator, This
Situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches
operation of an informant in Brazil. Some of the |
information that he received from the informant was
of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who
was being touted as a Presidential-candidate, CIA

. asked for the identity of the ‘Informant and we told
the Agency that the person could not be identified
because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed,
This case is being cited because_CIA may have evidence
that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi-~
nated pursuant to Directives, and that the matter was
further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability
of the information.

(19) TRAVEL OF BUREAU INFORMANTS TO CUBA

In September, 1965, we received information
indicating that oneof our informants on the Mexican border
was in a position to travel- to Cuba. A question was raised
concerning CIA interest in this matter, if the informant
made the trip, It was recommended and approved that we
not advise CIA concerning the identity of the informant
or his trip to Cuba, : 2

et It is not known if CIA acquired any knowledge
but, if the Agency did, we potentially are vulnerable,
The Agency could charge that. we were operating outside
of the U. S. and we failed to coordinate with the Agency.

(20) DISSEMINATION OF CIA INFORMATION IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

By letter dated May 5, 1965, we disseminated to
interested agencies, including CIA, a copy of a monograph
entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic." The mono-
graph contained considerable information which had emanated

t



_ ~f

“from,CIA.. We did not obtain clearance. from CIA for
the inclusion ofthis information in our monograph.
Clearance approval was not obtained because of the
urgency of the document, CIA was irritated because _
it considered our action a distinct violation of the
third agency rule. The Agency never made any protest.

(21) BUREAU INFORMANTS IN - paste ———

In 1966,and 1967, we were operating informants
in face ., At the inception of our operational ac~
tivity, CIA was not informed. In one case, we finally
were able to effect the necessary arrangements with CIA
whereby the Bureau would be permitted to run the informant
in Peace . In the second instance, we established an
agreement with CIA in October,’ 1967, “that we could con-
tinue handling an informant in PLACE . with the under-
standing that the Bureau Agent, on the occasion of each
visit, would cenfer with the local CIA office on political
information collected trom tne inzormant. ‘these two cases
had all the makings of a conflict. CIA was under the
definite impression that we had been running these
informants before. we had finally coordinated with them,

It is true that the CIA Chief in P4ACE . was much
incensed but no issue was made at CIA‘Headquarters and
themtter was put to rest.

“CIA may have developed concrete evidence that
we were operating in Pace bearing in mind that in
&@ plage such as PLACE _) it would not be difficult
for a CIA intelligence officer to spot an FBI Agent in

that we were operating in Ptacé without coordinating

Again, CIA could cite this as an instance where

purpose of the assignment was to follow Bureau leads in

COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES = AFRICA

In April, 1960, CIA inquired if the Bureau would
give any consideration to assisting the Agency toward
developing coverage in Africa. CIA was looking for the
services of any Negro informant who might be available.
The Agency also inquired about placing a Negro in the
Communist Party, USA, under a plan which would have us
an eventual objective, the sending of the informant to

‘a "great
emne,



hc

‘Africa under an appropriate cover and for an extended
period. We told CIA we had no informants available
because they were necessary for our own operations. We

* took the position that we saw no benefit to be gained by
loaning an informant on a short or long term basis.

e- This item is. being mentioned because Africa
has become vitally important to U. S..interest, bearing
in mind that both the Soviets and Chinese Communists have
made significant inroads into the area, CIA covld argue
that as early as 1960, it had the foresight to recognize
the need for additional coverage, that it appealed to the
Bureau for assistance, and that we did not cooperate,

”

In February, 1965, Bureau representatives met

,
od

with CIA officials and with MAME . to discuss
Sliegations made by WANE | 2 Soviet defector, relative
to alleged Soviet penetrations of CIA. MAHE was

interviewed in detail concerning these allegations. By
letter dated February 26, 1965, we officially advised CIA
that there appeared to be no basis at this time for a
full investigation of the individuals involved.
There are officials in CIA who continue to be
: seriously concerned about possible penetrations of the
‘+ Agency and have not Ssocer eed NAHE'S allegations.

We do not have any reason to believe that CIA
has developed any substantive evidence to support MAME'S
Allegations. If it does, we could be vulnerable and could
be charged that we did not cooperate and conduct the
necessary investigation in 1965.

‘In 1958, Vice President Richard M, Nixon traveled
‘to Latin America during which time there were numerous riots

jand his party. By letter dated May 16, 1958, we provided
the Vice President with a summary of information which ‘we

i to the trip. Most of this information came from CIA,
Our letter could be interpreted as. raising, the question

concerning the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America,

It is not known if CIA ever became knowledgeable
of the referenced communication. ‘As already indicated,
we do know that CIA personnel have been assigned to the
White House, We also know that ' MAME AWD

TITLE - Heneeyt cra, Was attached to Vice
President Nixon's staff,

If CIA is cognizant of the communication, the
Agency technically could raise a question concerning a
violation of the third agency rule and, furthermore,
could question the Bureau's propriety of making reference
to CIA's coverage in Latin America.,-,

(83) WAME of SugzecT ,

The captioned individual is a criminal infor-
tant whom we have been utilizing to very significant advan-
tage in New York City. He has been the source of valuable
criminal intelligence and has been a key witness in
prosecutions of cases being handled by the Bureau. We
acquired access to MAME through CIA, A covert CIA
operator in New York City had become acquainted with
WAHE saw his potential as a source of criminal intelligence,
and then conferred with MAME | CIA. WANE
contacted the Bureau Liaison Agent and asked if the Bureau
was interested. Negotiations were initiated and we
subsequently acquired the services of wawHé Although
the Agency has never officially made any statement to us,
it has been bitterly disappointed that the Bureau never
acknowledged CIA's assistance which the Agency considered
extremely valuable. :

(34) EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

ise For many years, we maintained tight restrictions

. with regard to the exchange of technical information with
- CIA, particularly as it related to the technical surveillance
field. CIA exhibited its equipment to us but, for many years,
we declined to show any of our devices, with some exceptions.

AW 55325 DocId:32989717 Page 131



a a Sebi

CYA never made any official protest but informally

J dndicated from time to time that the lack of exchange
ip this highly important field was prejudicial to over-
all intelligence and internal security interests. The
Agency implied that we actually were more open with the
British in this general area than we were with CIA.

. It should be noted that the foregoing situation

does not exist ‘today. ° There is good exchange between the
Bureau and CIA, a :

(35) CIA LECTURERS AT BUREAU TRAINING SCHOOLS

CIA has never been able to understand why the
Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to lecture at Bureau
schools or training courses, CIA has felt that through
@ careful selection of lecturers, the Agency could make
& very valuable contribution both to.the Bureau and to
CIA, The Agency has indicated that its participation in
some of our courses would give the Agency the opportunity
te doceribs CIA's oxganiaation, objectives, and opcratiscnal
problems, Furthermore, it has been expressed that Bureau
personnel could be given the opportunity to pose questions
and there would be a far better over-all orientation on
the part of our people,

The Liaison Agent: has “always resisted CIA's
request, It has been a delicate matter to handle because
Bureau personnel have lectured to hundreds of CIA employees,

(86) EXCHANGE in THE TRAINING FIELD

Although CIA has never officially made an issue
of the matter, the Agency has: not been happy about our
attitude concerning exchange of information in the training
field, When the matter has been broughtup for any discussion
by CIA, the Agency has been discouraged. CIA informally has
expressed the feeling that an exchange along certain guide-
lines could be most useful to the U. S. intelligence and
internal security effort.

(87) POSITIVE a

This is an area where discussion with CIA
officials’ can rapidly generate criticism of the Bureau
for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-
tance, Positive intelligence, briefly, is that information
which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating
foreign policy., Much of it is of‘a ‘political nature and

" @ vital portion pertains to scientific developments, military
Capabilities of foreign countries, and intentions of foreign
countries. Positive intelligence is rot only important
as it concerns the communist—bloc countries but 2lso
_ non-bloc nations.

There néver has been, any ‘lav, Directive, or
Exectitive Order which has fixed the ¥esponsibilities for .
the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in
the U. S. The Bureau does have a responsibility which
we refer to as internal security and vhich falls into the
accepted area of counterintelligence. We do investigate
subversives spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign
intelligence services, Our work in the positive intelli-
gence field, for the most part, has been restricted to
the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the State
Department, usually when a Solitical erisds occurs in
some country. 7

; CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous
unexplored field for expanded acquirenent of positive
intelligence in the U. S. This would mean vastly increased
a technical surveillance coverage, development of informants,
and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not
feel that we have aggressively moved on this particular
subject and that over the years, the Agency has been
thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem,

In PATE ° |, CIA requested the Bureau to
install technical surveillances at the offices and temporary
residences of two Fofé/¢VY Government officials visiting the
U. 8, Pursuant to instructions, CIA vas told to seek the
authority of the Attorney General. ‘The Director stated
that he did not want CIA utilizing FBI as a channel.

, In the same month, CIA inquired if the Bureau
i would reestablish technical surveillance coverage on
MAME who CIA felt was a key figure in the
transmittal of scientific intelligence data to the
« POREMVY Intelligence Service. We declined to reinstitute
the coverage: CIA considered the matter important “because
of its relationship to the PLAGE ee :
On October 21, 1969, we told CIA that future
requests from.CIA fon technical surveillance coverage

CIA has never made any official. comment or
protest but it has considered the afore-mentioned .action
by the Bureau as unfriendly and uncooperative. The Agency
has looked to the Bureau °as the logical point of contact and
as the only organization having the Nesources and capabilities
. of adequately determining if such coverage is even feasible,

© (88) MISCELLANEOUS ITEUS

The Liaison Agent: recalls fragments of. other
situations or conflicts which occured over the years and
which resulted in the voicingof CIA displeasure or criticism.
The Agent cannot recall the names of the cases which is

. Recessary to acquire the required data, There was one
- instance early in the 1950's which involved information
F received from a source of unknown reliability charging
Allen Dulles with having been a communist and a spy while
in Europe... We disseminated the information to several
agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

The Agent also has recollection of instances when
CIA alleged that its source or informant was compromised by
Bureau revelation of CIA information during the course of
interviews conducted by us. Technically, this would be a
violation of the third agency rule and, if CIA had hard
core facts, we would be vulnerable, particularly if an
important informant was lost. CIA never made any official
Assue or protest.

this country, While this Bureau does not have any statutory
responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign
intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential
for the development of such intelligence in this country is
considerable, The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort
to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

officials of the Government, While these efforts have,
of course, been incidental to our main Internal security
