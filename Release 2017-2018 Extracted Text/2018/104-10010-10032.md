BBC Television Interview - Professor Trevor-Roper ~ 14 January 1965

Erskine B. Childers, Moderator: Tonight's encounter is with
Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper, who is the regius professor of
modern history at Oxford. Last September, the Warren Commission
on the assassination of President Kennedy brought out its massive
report with over twenty volumes of evidence. It found that

Lee Harvey Oswald, and he alone, killed the President. A month
ago, Professor Trevor-Roper published a sensational article in
the Sunday Times dissenting from these findings. Now to talk
to him are: Anthony Lewis, who covered the Warren Commission
investigation for the New York Times and is now their London
correspondent, and Louis Bland Cooper, criminologist, writer on

legal affairs in the Observer, and lecturer at London University.

Professor Trevor-Roper, the killing of President Kennedy was
followed by waves of rumor and speculation about who did it and
whether there was a conspiracy, but the Warren Report seems to have
satisfied virtually everyone. Now I think many people were
astonished that you, as a scholar, have reopened the whole

affair in this way. Why did you do it?

Professor Trevor-Roper: I did it because it didn't satisfy me.
I agree that there was loud public acceptance of the Warren Report
when it was published, and, indeed, some papers stated openly

that by now all doubts were resolved and no problems remained.

And this was the official reaction. But I must say, I find*:.
that in talking in America to ordinary, educated people, that

scepticism is very wide.

Cooper: Professor, when did you first think that the Warren
Commission's Report might not be as sound as most of us thought
that it was in its findings that only Lee Harvey Oswald was the
killer of President Kennedy?

T-R: When I read the Report.

Coopers Yes, but at what state, I mean what particular fact
lead you to begin to suspect its validity?

T-R: Well, I think the first thing that struck my mind when I
read that Report was the problem of the killing of Tippet, which

seemed to me handled in a very vague and indeed evasive manner,

Childers: This is the killing of the policeman, very soon after
,

President Kennedy. : i
\
T-R: Yes. The whole chain of reasoning whereby the Warren |

Report seems to establish that Oswald had killed Tippet and that

Oswald had been identified, in some way, as the possible \

fy
\

assassin of the President, and that Tippet, we must presume,

had approached him with that suspicion in his mind. All this
\

seemed to me very strange and unconvincing and a positive

difficulty about the timing. How did he do it?

Lewis: Professor Trevor-Roper, that was one point you made in
your article. You said, in essence, you rested your case on
quoting. a few central facts which render the whole Report
suspect, the one you just mentioned is one of them. Then you
suggested that the police notes, alleged police notes of the
interrogation of Oswald had been destroyed, that the pathologist,
the doctor, had been persuaded to adjust his evidence to the
police view, the pathologist's notes had been destroyed, and
that a bag in which the Commission found Oswald had carried the
gun to his place of employment had been destroyed. Taking those
particular points which you made, perhaps in reverse order, the
point about the paper bag you've now withdrawn. I think you
said you'd eat humble pie on that because you asserted that the
bag had been destroyed when, in fact, it hadn't been destroyed.
Indeed, a picture of it was printed in the Report. It was

wzeferred. to frequently, and I must say I wonder how could anyone

doing a scholarly piece of work, which you said you were doing,

“have made such a mistake.

Prof. T-R: Well, we all make mistakes, and I admitted that
mistake. That bag was destroyed as evidence in the sense that

it was discolored beyond recognition by chemical tests to which


13-00000

it was subjected, and, therefore, the PBI judged that it was
longer valid evidence and made another bag and submitted the
ether bag 2? + Now, I made a mistake in reading
the evidence and I was writing under a certain pressure of time
and I noticed that mistake afterwards. I noticed it before it
was pointed out because, as you say, the original bag, discolored
though it was, remained an exhibit, and as soon as that was
brought to my attention, I withdrew. I'm not going to defend |

myself on grounds where I think I was wrong. I made a mistake.

Lewis: No, well of course it is understandable, anyone can make
amistake. But it is a rather serious charge, at least I think
it would ordinarily be considered serious to charge the
authorities in any country with deliberately destroying evidence
and I shouldn't think that one would do that lightly. Say that
lightly.

T-R: I was not making any charges. I was stating what I
believed to be facts. One of the facts, which I stated, was
erroneous in that particular, and as soon as it was brought to

my attention, I withdrew it.

Cooper: Can I take up another point, Professor, with you? And
that's with regard to the pathologist's notes. Now you said,

in your first article in the Sunday Times, that Dr. Hughes, who
was the chief pathologist conducting the autopsy, had burned all

his original notes. Do you stand by that statement today?

SO ERIE cE Se»


13-00000

T-R: Burned his original notes?
Cooper: All his original notes, were your words, Professor.
T-R: All -- I think are his words too.

Cooper: No, they're not, Professor, because, in fact, when he
gave evidence, he said all he had done was a first preliminary
draft. Can I perhaps remind you what, in fact, took place was
that Dr. Hughes had, in fact, taken his notes at the autopsy,
they were preserved, and they were given to the Commission. All
he had done was, when he had gone home to draft his repert, he
did a first draft, no doubt as you would do if you were writing
an article for Sunday Times again, he didn't like it very much
and he threw that in the fire when he had done his second draft

report. That's what was burned.

T-R: I was quoting his actual affidavit.

Cooper: Well now, even his actual affidavit didn't say that.
T-R: What does it say?

Cooper: The original affidavit said that the chief pathologist
at the - well, this is in fact what you say, that the..

T-R: No, I want to know what the actual affidavit said.
Cooper: The actual affidavit said that he had burnt his notes

T-R: Just a minute, it doesn't say “he,” it says "I.°


13-00000

Childers: Well, gentlemen, can I suggest, really what we're’

getting at here is your fundamental question, I think, Professor
Trevor-Roper -~ whether there is evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald
took a gun into the book depository building, behind the
President's car as it was travelling, and whether he fired it.
The pathologist's evidence concerned whether thare was a bullet
wound in the front of the neck, going into the front or the
back, and so on. Now, do you still claim that there is no

evidence that Oswald took the gun in and fired it?

T-R: There is no valid evidence that Oswald took the gun in.
The question of whether he fired it is a different matter and

the evidence is of a slightly different character.

What do you mean by that?
Childers: Tony Lewis.

Lewis: Yes, I would ask the same question. You said there is
no valid evidence. I should just like to run down a bit of the
evidence which the Commission had which seems to me to be extra-
ordinarily more detailed than would be produced in the ordinary
criminal trial. I don't know whether you've read many reports
of criminal trials. But just let me run down a few things that

they had.


13-00000

-7-

T-R: Now what you must run down is the evidence that he brought

the bag containing the gun into the book depository.

Lewis: Yes, but you know the way things work in life, Professor
frevor Roper, if I may say so, is that ordinarily in the case
of murders, you don't have six witnesses standing around watching

the killing.
T-R: No.

Lewis: Circumstantial evidence is necessarily relied on, and
that's what exists in most cases and exists in great detail in
this case. So, if you'll forgive me, I'll tell you what I think
is relevant to the facts. Number 1, the ownership of the gun by
Oswald was established beyond any doubt. The place where he kept
it was established, the fact that it was not there immediately
after the killing was established, and that the shape of the gun
was still shown on the blankets where it had been kept. The fact
that he made a bag, a paper bag, out of materials available at. the
place where he worked was fairly well shown. That he carried

a bag -

{-R: Now, now, may I interrupt? You are talking about “fairly
well.” I believe that in a matter as delicate as this it's

important to know what is certain and what is not certain. Half



13-00000

: my complaints against the Warren Report is that adverbs like
"fairly," “Probably,” “Perhaps," etc. are used to slide over a

great number of difficulties.

Cooper: This is to exclude circumstantial evidence, because

circumstantial evidence can never be certainty, of course.

! T-R: Yes, but in the absolutely essential links, I think it
is important to state what is circumstantial evidence and what

is not.

Lewis: Now let me proceed and you can decide whether it is

circumstantial or not.

T-R: May I interrupt you?

Lewis: Yes, sir.

T-R: You are presently on a particular point, that is to say,

the carrying of the gun in. You'll remember that in my article

I never stated that it was, that Oswald did not carry the gun in,

' and my case does not rest on any such suggestion. I said he may

have carried it in and he may have fired it. My statement is not

a denial that he carried it in. My statement was to point out
that the evidence that he carried it in is not valid, and my

‘ charge against the Report is not on this issue at all, it is that the
procedure of the Commission in building up this Report has been

lax throughout.


13-00000

-$-

Lewis: Perhaps I misunderstood, I thought you were judging, as I
read the pire that you wrote, I thought you were judging the Report
as a report. You made some statements that were quite categorical.
One of which was, as I recall, just to move on, I haven't gone

on with all the evidence there was, of persons seeing Oswald

with the gun in his hand, fingerprints on the gun, on the bag, on
boxes around ~ pretty complete evidence by the ordinary standard.
But you made, for example, a categorical statement that the police
must have taken notes of their interrogation of Oswald.

T-R: Now, what are you asking me about?

Lewis: Well, let me finish my question, perhaps, and that the
notes were destroyed. That's again a rather serious charge. Do
you stand by that charge?

T-R: I stand by my statement that I*n astonished that in these
circumstances no notes were kept and one explanation, the one
which I accepted was that they were cestroyed. If you tell me

there's another explanation, there's another explanation.

Coopers When you say notes, Professor, do you mean notes taken
actually at the moment when Oswaii was being interrogated, or

notes made subsequent to the interrogation?

T-R: I mean record of what he said.


13-00000

~10-

Cooper: Well that's here - that's all in an appendix in the
Report - there are pages of it.

T-R: No, but not in any form that could be used in an

ordinary, at least not in an English court of law.

Cooper: Well, do you think that it's normal police practice
for policementto actually record notes as the accused personal
suspect is making his statement?

T-R: If I'm run in for 2? and the police say
to me that anything I say may be used in evidence against me,

he writes down what I say.

Cooper: But, Professor, there are circumstances vhere the
policeman can merely give oral evidence of what yca said to him,

He doesn't need to write it down, does he?

T-R:. I should hope that the assassination of the President
of the United States is a case sufficiently important for

careful details.

Cooper: Of course, at that moment they were simp:y taking him
in as the killer of Tippet, not as the killer of the President,
weren't they?


13-00000

-11l-

Childers: Mr. Trevor-Roper, can I bring this to a wider level
now, because in a sense you've already said that you were not
suggesting that there was definitely a conspiracy of some kind.
For example, a conspiracy in, shall we say, destroying notes

that the police, -you feel, should have taken, or might have taken.
But you've also criticized the very character of the Warren
Commission Atself. You saia@, I believe, that you joined the

Who Killed Kennedy Committee here in Britain originally because
you were convinced that the composétion of the Commission and the
procedure which it announced were ill-calculated to produce the
truth or guarantee a full examination of the evidence. Now,

what was it, really, about the Commission that you were unhappy
about?

f-R: Well, the Commission consisted of busy men, mainly
politicians in an election year, and it seemed to me that it was
insufficiently independent of the sources of its material. That
is to say, one sees the Commission as a tribunal before whom the
police or the PBI are making a case, which is essentially a
prosecutor's case. It is essential that the tribunal stands
apart from the police, from the FBI, receives the police and

FBI evidence, is able to look at it quite objectively with the
aid of other evidence such as might be brought by a defense
counsel in an ordinary trial. And it seemed to me that this

was not so. That if one looks at the way the Commission worked,

one finds that it was set up at a time when, on the evidence,


13-00000

-12-
the FBI had already perfected its case. And, Mr. Hoover, the
head of the FBI, being interrogated by the Commission in February,
stated that he had reached his conclusions, they were final,
that anyone who dissented was a lunatic, and he then presented
a mass of material which lead to that conclusion, which did not
include certain material which we know exists, which, perhaps,
didn't lead to that conclusion. And I think that given the
weakness of the Commission, it was very difficult, psychologically,
for them, in a very short time, to break down this pyramid of
prearranged material which lead to a particular conclusion.
They dotted the i's and they crossed the t's and their whole
method of examination (and I read all through the twenty-six
volumes of evidence) their whole method of examination seems to
me lax. They just recorded what people said, the cross-examination
is not the kind of cross*examination which would have taken place

in a judicial inquiry.
Childers: Louis Bland Cooper.

Cooper: Well, I think most English people, Professor, would
agree with a great deal of what you say, that in fact this
Commission of inquiry didn't conduct it according to standards
that we would think proper. There was also a cut and thrust of
debate, you know, of a defense counsel cross-examining witnesses,
and I think in reading the Report you would have felt this. Bat
at the same time, isn't this eee ones in America, that the

commissions of inquiry there are not quite conducted on the


13-00000

;

-13-
same basis, they are fact-finding.

T-R: Um-huh, and what is the result? You get a commission

of inquiry like the commission of inquiry on Pearl Harbor,

which is now recognized, I think, by historians, to be incorrect.

Childers: Anthony Lewis, you actually covered the day-to-day
workings of this Commission.

A.L: I just wonder, I'm bound to observe, I wonder how someone,
how you would feel, Professor Trevor-Roper, if I made a general
statement, the kind you just made, tarring all royal commissions
because of something one commission did twenty-five years ago.

I must say, that was just a bit too much. Now, getting on to
this subject, I would never be an apologist for the methods the
Warren Commission used. I think it made mistakes as to its
procedure, but your suggestion that it was not sufficiently
independent and too closely tied and committed to an FBI view
seems to me to display an appalling ignorance of the American
system and the FBI and its relationship with this Commission.
One thing, you said the FBI had already established its case
when the Commission was founded. The Commission was appointed
on November 30, eight days after the assassination, at a time
when nothing had been resolved, no evidence of any significance

was confirmed -

T-R: I'm sorry, I should have said in February when the

Commission started its meetings. Started its work.


13-00000

“214-

Lewis: Secondly, I think it would be very hard, very hard, to
find among the 180 million people in the United States, any
figure who was more independent of the PBI, who was less ~
popular with the head of the FBI, than the Chief Justice of the
United States, Mr. Earl Warren. I just think that is a, frankly,
an almost laughable a ?proposition? . After the Report came out,
Mr. Hoover, who cares more than anything about the FBI, was
highly critical of the report, and of the Commission, of leaked
information to the press, and the suggestion that they're

working hand in glove is difficult -

T-R: On what point was he critical? He was critical on one
point only, and that was the one point on which the Commission

happened to cast a passing breath of dissent on the FBI.

Cooper: Professor, what relevance is J. Edgar Hoover's evidence
in this? He wasn't at Dallas, he didn't see any of the shooting,
none of his evidence was directed to the facts of the assassination
of President Kennedy. There is simply opinion evidence by J. Edgar
Hoover, I would have thought that this Commission, even supposing
it weren't the best, could have assessed what is factual evidence

and what is opinion evidence. Don't you agree?

T-R: Why then, I might ask, did the Commission summon to give
evidence, Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, whose opinion, you say, is not

worth having?


13-00000

-15-

Cooper: No, I didn't say his opinion wasn't worth having,
I said it was opinion evidence. It's valuable for what it's

worth, but it is not factual.
T-R: Why didn't they summon the head of the FBI in Dallas?

Cooper: Well, I don't know the answer to that, perhaps you

don't know the answer either.

T-R: I don't. I'm not claiming to know anything, I'm merely
claiming that I have no alternative theory about the murder of
Kennedy. I am claiming that the procedure of the Commission does

not lead to the results which are stated in the Report.

Childers: But Professor, when you say that you feel that the
Commission was committed by some choice to take ?largely?

FBI or police sources, do you yourself have specific witnesses
in mind, for example, specific evidence that they didn't hear,
that you feel is absolutely vital?

T-R: Yes, I mentioned one. The head of the FBI in Dallas.

Childers: You feel he knows something, or you know he knows

something?

T-R: Well, I'11 make a positive statement. In the search of
the 6th floor of the book depository, there was found a bag.

This bag contained some chicken bones, and the head of the FBI,


13-00000

-16-

~ local FBI, was quoted by the New York Times, your paper, as

saying, a respectable paper, as saying ...
Lewis:. Thank you.

T-Rt ‘explicitly that the PBI had detected the fingerprints of
Oswald on this bag and that this bag was the lunch of the

assassin. Thereupon, a black man called Bonnie Ray Williams
appeared and said, as a matter of fact, "That is my lunch bag*

and the fingerprinta miraculously disappeared. Now, the

Commission states that the head of the FBI, local FBI, denied having

said this. But why did they not ?fall on? him, to whom did he

deny it? If this raises a legitimate doubt in the mind of the

reader, surely it should be allayed, surely it is the duty of
the Commission to summon this man, Mr. Gordon ?Jankin? and
question him whether he did or did not _ that. Perhaps it
was their duty to summon’. the correspondent of your paper to say
why did he report it thus if it was untrue, Inevitably, an
element of suspicion is left in the mind when a witness of that

nature is not summoned.

Childers: Anthony Lewis.

Lewis: Well, without wanting to criticize my own newspaper, or
American newspapers generally, I will say that many of the things
that were said in Dallas by the newspapers, in the turmoil that

followed that very terrible event, simply don't stand up.


13-00000

-“l7-

T-R: Many of the things in the Warren Report don't stand up

either, but this isn't a reason for not pressing.

Lewis: Well, I must say that we've tried to get out what the

things are that don't stand up. It seems to me you haven't

mentioned any yet, Professor Trevor-Roper, what doesn't stand
up? For example , the paper bag, the notes of the pathologist.
Let me take one other specific if I may. You made the statement,

again, a rather serious one ...

Childers: Just a second...I'm sorry, let Professor Trevor-

i Roper answer that.
! Lewis: Yes, certainly.

' T-R: Let me take the case of the murder of Tippet. This seems
to me a very important episode which is involved in deepest
mystery and yet is passed over by the Commission as if it had
been established with perfect clarity. The position is that,
according to the Commission, Tippet accosted Oswald and, after
some conversation, Oswald shot Tippet. And this episode is’
essential because, whatever its cause, it lead to the arrest —
of Oswald. Now, on what evidence, I ask, and I think any a

reasonable person may ask, on what evidence did Tippet think

that Oswald was a suitable person to accost as a suspect of the
assassination, for that is what we are ???

Now, all that the Commission can state is that a very general


-18-

description was sent out saying that the suspect is believed

to be a white man, aged about 30, about 5°10" in height, and
about 160 pounds in weight. Now that is so vague a description
that it applies to a very great number of people in Dallas and
yet, Oswald was the only person, as far as we know, who actually
fell under suspicion. Furthermore, this description, vague though
it is,for the purposes of a particular arrest, is remarkable
precise in relation to what may have been seen by a man standing
on the ground six floors below through a window. And yet, the
only piece of evidence which has been given which can relate

the shooting to the advice sent out to the police, and among them
to Tippet, is a statement by a man called Brennen who saw, said

he saw, Oswald from the ground floor.
Childers: Louis Blana Cooper.

Cooper: Professor, is that really quite fair? You see, after
all, Tippet is dead and we don't know how Tippet reacted, either
to the messages that came over the radio, or to the sight of
Oswald. He may have had the faintest suspicion that Oswald
might have been the man that they were looking for. We don't

know what happened.
T-R: Now, you're talking about "may" and "might."

Cooper: Oh well this is, I mean, the Commission is in the same

position as we are now.

T-R: No, no, no, they were in a much better position than we


13-00000

‘~19-

are. They needn't have talked about “may” and “might,” there
were several witnesses to the Tippet episode who have not been
called.

Cooper: Nobody knows what made Tippet react. fhis we don't

know. Never can know.

T-R: If the Commission had taken the trouble to call other
witnesses who were available, it may be that they would have

discovered.

?: Why should they rely on the car, Professor, it couldn't

have been seen.

T-R: He was sitting in the car, according te one witness who
has contradicted herself again and again and who is the only
witness on whom the Commission has chosen to rely when there

are other witnesses available.

?Well, I think that (garbled - all talking tegether)
T-R: This is much too important a point to push aside.
?No, I'm not pushing it aside.

Lewis: Wouldn't you say it is just not true they didn't rely
on that witness. They quoted half a dozen witnesses to the

affair between Oswald and Tippet, and as Louis says, there'll
never be any certainty about what was in Tipret's mind because

he's dead. oe
ey ft


13-00000

-20-

T-R: There'll never be any certainty about what was in his
mind but there are other people who were witnesses to episodes

in that sequence of events who have not been summoned.

Childers: Mr. Roper, can I take it beyond this detail which
obviously we can't resolve here. You also challenged, in fact
you said above all there is the question of Lee Harvey Oswald's
motive, Why should he have done this? What did you really mean

by that?

T-R: I mean that the Commission, having come to the conclusion
that Oswald, and Oswald alone, without external motivation, shot
the President, and being therefore unable to provide a rational
explanation of why he did it, has appealed to a psychological
explanation. The Commission has said, "We must look for the
sources of Oswald's action in Oswald's psychological case history."
Very well, let us accept that basis. Now if Oswald was either,
on the one hand, a perverted idealist, or, on the other hand, a
mere exhibitionist, and shot the President for one of those
reasons, or both, the psychological reaction when he was arrested
would be to boast of it. As an idealist he would say, "I did the
act of justice." As an exhibitionist, he would say, “It was I

who did it."

Cooper: 2? I read this report and one
of the things that struck me immensely was here was a man who was

at odds with his wife, they'd been separated, he goes home the


13-00000

-21-

night before, he tries to strike up a conversation with her, she
will have nothing to do with him and he goes off the next morning,
he goes to the garage, picks up this rifle, and he says, “I will
show her that I am a man" and goes out to do the brave act. Now

isn't this psychologically acceptable theory?

Childers: Anthony Lewis.
f-R: But then he doesn't show it because when he arrested he says,

“I didn't do it, I don’t know what you're talking about."

Cooper: This is a game--the man who wants to go on trial and
wants to be able to brave it out and fight the authorities and
collect all the publicity...

T-R: In that case, he miscalculated, but on your own reasoning,
if he did it in order to draw attention to himself, he singularly
failed to draw attention to himself,

Cooper: No, he didn't.
Childers: Anthony,Lewis, a very brief word from you on Oswald.

Lewis: Well, I was really going to turn a little bit to say that,
Professor Trevor-Roper, you said at the end of your article that
you thought the acceptance of the Report was emotional not rational.
Some might feel that your article was the same, I wonder whether

you really are ‘not basing your whole approach on a premise that


eee

American society is sick, that there's something wrong with it,

suggestions that you made.

T-R: I do not believe that American society is sick, I regard it
as a perfectly rational society, I don't know why you should

say this. I regard the Report as a document which does not
stand up on the evidence which is available in those twenty-six

volumes.

Childers: Well finally, Professor, after all this controversy,

and what we've just been saying, I think, are you going to

continue to challenge the Warren Report?

T-R: I'm not going to go on repeating myself. I shall go on,
naturally, I shall watch it. As a matter of fact, even since

I published my article, an American lawyer, a lawyer actually
employed by the Warren Commission, has published an article in
the American Bar Association Journal stating that on the
evidence produced by the Warren Commission, no court of law coula
find Oswald guilty.

Childers: You're going to continue then what you hope to see -

new witnesses brought forward?

T-R: I shall continue to observe what happens, I think that
witnesses' memories will fade, a great deal of testimony is lost,
witnesses’ memories are even m ore deceptive than politician's

memoirs, and, on the other hand, there may be further revelations.
