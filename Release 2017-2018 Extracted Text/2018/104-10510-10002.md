The vocntional rehabilitation phase of the AUBUD medical

program.onded on 30 June 1966 with the completion of courses by the

remaining trainees.:

The activity, established in April 1964 by

allangement with

the Florida State Diviston of Vocational Rehabili

trition, has roduced the number of medical dependency cases frogs

One of the remaining cases,

a Garcia Lines case funded by Headquarters.

These sir menercpresent

difficult medical

problems whose disposition will be the subject of

a separato report.

The original 69 cases classified.ns unemployable because

of medical disability were referred to the AMBUD vocational reha-

bilitation nctivity as a means of terminating WOFACT yesponsibility

for their continued support. Initial processing of the

69 referrals

resulted in '58 active participants of which 35 were ultimately re-

turned to employment.

Twenty-three were dropped during evaluation

or training for many reasons including lack of interest, excessive

absenteeism,

inability to learn,

emotional instability, severity of

handicap, relocation, or confinement in an institution..

of the marginal

cases in this group were given partial training

and/or a routine of work which resulted in acquiring sufficient

motivation to solve their own work problems.

3. A Ilst of the participants, coursos attended, date and

reason dropped,

or date course completed is attached.

It should

be noted that most of the trainees also benefited from pre-vocational

training English language instruction which made then more attractive

to the potential employers.

The apparent success of the vocational rehabilitation

activity could be largely attributed
