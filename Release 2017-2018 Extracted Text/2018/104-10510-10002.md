Reference: UFGA-25261, paragraph 11 (3 June 1966) 19..24- 45/2

1. The vocational rehabilitation phase of the AMBUD medical
program ended on 30 June 1966 with the completion of courses by the
remaining trainees. The activity, established in April 1964 by
arrangement with the Florida State Division of Vocational Rehabilt~
tation, has reduced: the number of amet cases fro

to six, One of the'remaining cases,

R separate report,

2, The original 69 cases classified.as unemployable because
of medical disability were referred to the: ANBUD vocational reha—

for their. continued support, Initial processing of the 69 referrals

turned to employment. Twenty-three were dropped during evaluation
or training for many reasons including lack of interest, excessive
absenteeism, inability to learn, emotional instability, severity of
handicap, relocation, or confinement in an institution, However,
some of the marginal cases in. this group -were given partial training
and/or a routine of work which resulted in acquiring sufficient
motivation to solve their own work problems,

3. A list of the participants, courses attended, date and.
reason dropped, or date course completed is attached, ft should
be noted that most of the trainees also benefited from Ppre~vocational

4. The apparent success of the vocational rehabilitation
activity could be largely attributed to the supervisor, Mr, Gordon
D. Smith, a senior counselor assigned to the activity by his

th his handling of the activity, and the trainees, Hr. Smith demon
strated a high level of professtonal abTlity, Strong inte st, and

$2,000.00 less than the original estimate submitted by Mr. Smith,
