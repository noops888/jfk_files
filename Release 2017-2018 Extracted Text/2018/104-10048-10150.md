after mulling. the whole thing over decided that he did

not want to be bound.by such an agreement, and was honest enough
to cancel it in’a straightforward manner.

II. Production

4. Threé disseminable reports were credited to Subject
during Jurie:

a. UFG-3006 (cable) from Frank Fiorini, "Planned
Raid on Cuba by DIAZ Lanz Brothers".

bs .UFG-3089 (cable) from Jose ARIOLA, "Commando
Invasion of Cuba a Hoax".

c.: UFG=3108 (cable) from Frank Fiorini, “Current
ar ‘Activities of Frank Fiorini".

$..- In.addition to the above, Subject conducted lengthy
debriefings of several UR executives who cane out of asylum in
June. These were very valuable as operational data for the handl-
ing of JMWAVE relations with that organization. Subject also has
been of considerable assistance in general legwork among the
various Cuban exile individuals and groups who are not otherwise
easily accessible to JMWAVE.

6. Subject was paid $420.07 as salary for the month of
June ($500 minus withholding for income tax). He was reimbursed

$86.87 for operational expenditures made during the period 25 May -
24 June 1963.

IV. Future Plans

7~ Subject has shown a flair for intensive debriefing of
operational prospects in addition to his demonstrated ability in
extensive sampling of opinion and intention in the Cuban exile
community. It:is planned to assign him a number of operational
leads of undetermined potential. His preliminary findings can

save valuable case officer time in separating the wheat from the
chaff.
