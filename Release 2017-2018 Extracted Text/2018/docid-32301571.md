Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan
RE: MIRR

Alpizar has learned that MIRR intends to utilize two boats
in this operation. A large boat piloted by a Cuban captain will
rendezvous at sea with a smaller fast boat carrying the demolition
bombs which will have departed from the Homestead, Florida, area.

The bombs will be loaded on the bigger. boat which will then proceed
to Bimini, Alpizar is attempting to discreetly. ascertain more details
concerning the exact identity of the boats and other personnel
involved in this operation and the Miami Office is maintaining close
liaison with Alpizar.

Miami has previously suggested, and the Bureau has concurred,
that seizure by U. S. Customs of the boats involved as they are
departing Florida would be the most feasible way to stop this operation,
Under existing policy Customs will seize the. boats and explosives
involved but the participants would not be arrested. Miami points out
that this procedure would afford adequate protection to our informant,
Alpizar,

Mr. James T, Murphy, FAA, Washington, P,. C., advised on
12-16-63 that he has been in contact with Mr. Jack Kinny, FAA official
in Miami, According to Mr. Murphy, Kinny has the authority to ground
the aircraft to be used in this raid under any number of pretexts and
at the request of our Miami Office Mr. Kinny would ground this aircraft
for technical reasons. Our Miami Office has established liaison with
Mr. Kinny and is being advised of the information furnished by Mr. Murphy. |

Miami is following this matter closely with Alpizar and
will keep the Bureau, Customs and FAA advised of all pertinent details.

The information in attached teletype was telephonically
disseminated 12-16-63 to Mr. Le: Johnson, s stoms; James T
Murphy, FAA; E. &. Frisa, State ul Skoric Ay d Department R
Attorney John BH. Davitt. We are also advising +t litary intelli
agencies.

ACTION:

For information. We wiil continue to afford this matter
