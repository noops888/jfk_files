MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

impossible to find transmittal Time

74628 (10 Oct a3)

1r. Echols o

Tele t* Commo informed me on 23 Marci

that

COMMO keeps logs of transmittal times for outgoing cables

and teletypes only ninety days. At the end of that time

they are destroyed. There is no point, he stated, in

trying to find the transmittal times of teletypes

in October 1963 as such logs have been destroyed by now.

2. It is, therefore, impossible to find the trans-

mittal times of OUT Teletypes 74678 (10 October 1963).

Logs containing this information have been destroyed.
