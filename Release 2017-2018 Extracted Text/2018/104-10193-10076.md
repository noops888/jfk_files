SOMBGENTS OF REVIEWAG SFFICTAL
I conenr in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and 4+.

I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong, "
with justification. I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall
administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more
appropriately be rated "proficient," or perhaps "strong."

SUBJECT: “William K. Harvey ~ Memorandum in lieu of |
fitness’ report for period 30 March 1960 -
10 May 1962

1, ‘It is difficult ‘to prepare a,fitness report on this
outstabding officer,’ largely because forms do not lend them- __ ._..
selves to measuring his many unique characteristics. His
strengths are in professional knowledge’and competence in
the operational field, in a toughness of mind and firmness
of, attitude, while the latter in past years have moved him
into positions that were sometimes stronger ‘than superior
officers, -with a responsibility for adjustments necessary
in matters of policy in relation to Agency position in the
comminity, were able to handle easily, his on closeness to
policy ‘positions of .thé Agency within the U.S. community in
“the last’ two years has. found<him with a real ability to
handle policy matters and to adjust to necessities, without
losing ’his firmness, and ‘his. independence of thought.

2. He is sometimes accounted to be less than outgiving
of information about operational matters in which he is engaged,
yet it should be remembered that this characteristic has been
part and parcel of a sound operational attitude in his career.
He has a wide knowledge of personalities within the officer
corps of the DD/P'and-is for the most part a good selector of
officers to accomplish necessary ‘tasks. He handles people
well. He has a tremendous energy and is a loyal officer both
to his superiors:'and to the purposes of the Clandestine Services

of CIA.

3. He ig one of the few distinctly outstanding officers
in the DD/P. °

EU‘OF FITNESS REPORT °

The following‘ statement relates to the performance of.

William Ke Harvey, GS 18, Chief of FI,. Division D.

This officer, has held a series of responsible positions
in. DDYP aiid its predecessor clandestine intelligente organiza-
tion for well over ten years. He excels in the field of
clandestine operatiozs in general and.especially so in that

. phase of clandestine staff. and operational activities concerned

with the procurement, handling and exploitation of highly
sensitive and critical: intelligence and operational materials,

ae His performance generally over ‘the recent years has

‘proved him ‘to be one of the outstanding officers of the DD/P
organizition. He has demonstrated clearly superior performance
both in staff respotsibility at Headquarters and as Chief of
Base in.a'very important. field-station where he was directly
engaged in supervising-and carrying on operations successfully
against targets of the highest priority.

_. In thé period under review, June. 1959 to March 1960, he
took over and directed functioning of one of DD/Ps most
sensitive components charged with achievement by special

“heans against targets of the highest importance. This included

carrying on negotiations and liaison with other components

of CIA and-other Agercies and Departments of the U. S. Government
concerned With his special field. His performance of this
responsibility in maay respects has been outstanding. He has
continued to demonstrate his fitness to handle a wide range of
pesitions of major responsibility within the clandestine service.

Among his outstanding characteristics are: thorough
understanding of his profession and. ability to make this clear
to persons of high level whose knowledge of the Clandestine
Services is general. He is fim, tenacious, and on occasions
strongly aggressive in pursuit of his point of view. While this
may sometimes make for. difficulty on the part of those in
higher echelons who ¥ish to dispose of a complicated problem
easily and quickly, this officer's persistence in carefully

SUBJECT: — Fitness Report - Willtam K. Harvey iz

November 1957 - January 1959 -

+ 1, Subject's abilities and performance’ are too generally known
to require detailed ‘comment. One of thé very senior-officers ‘in.
KUDOVE ‘he has ‘been chief of what fs probably the’ largest and most.
productive overseas Base of KUBARK for approximately’ séven years.
During this ‘period Subject has been. personally: responsible for a
number of operational successes, some of. which have. béen of national
AmpoPtance.’ Possessed of driving energy, determination and initia-
tive, he has few equals in’ professional experience and competence.
Throughout his administration of the Base he has established and
maintained. exceedingly High standards of accoiplistment, discipline
and endeavor. Subject's Judgement, on occasion, is impulsive and
proposals of the Base ‘have been, from tine to time, advanced -and
defended with greater vehemence and more. exhaustively than the
vecasion, objectively speaking, required. Subject's basic self-
discipline, good sense and loyalty, novever, have prevented any such
incidents; which are in large measure ‘manifestations of the highly
éharged atmosphere and insistent dperational pressures of Berlin,
froa developing into serious friction with the German Station or
dashington headquarters.

2. Ithas been a pleasure to serve with this officer and,
‘during ais assignment,he has consistently rendered dedicated and
effective service of the very highest order.
