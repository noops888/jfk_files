JOHN HOWARD LAWSON

948 ELYRIA DRIVE

LOS ANGELES 63, CALIFORNIA

...

Dear Mr. Schlichting:

I am most gratified to

receive your letter of July 21st, regarding

definite plans for publication of THEORY AND TECHNIQUE

and FILM IN THE SATLLE OF IDEAS.

Tie terms are entirely satis-

factory. I shall write to Mr. Felshin at M&l telling

him that I feel we should accept the proposal on

the film book. I assume that whatever contract or

letter is required can be sent to me on THEORY AND

TECHNIQUE, along with the advance payment. The

arrangements

and payment on tie other book should

be sent to Mri. Felshin.

I am troubled by your enquiry

concerning

the disregard of contemporary German

playwrights in THEORY AND TECHNIQUE. It is a real

weakness, which goes back to certain limitations

on my knowledge and understanding when the book

was first written twenty years ago. It is also

that many other cratemporary trends are not

adequately oalt eith: or example, the only

approach to the R

sia theatre of

the twentieth

century is in

tere. of

hekhov and Satanislavski

(on pp. 11' rd rd. is is quite different

fromthe sort of trostmot I would give Cheklov today.

(Perhaps

ou have seen fy study of Chekhov in MASSES

AND MAINSTREAM, Octrive

my natortal in the bool contains no mention of Gorkt.

It is hardly right that

I jo not feel that I can enter

into a fuller discussion of German or other tusga

contemporary European theatre trends: to do so would

mean a very extensive rewriting, a change in the

form of the book, and would require a detailed know-

ledge of recent dramatic development which I do not

possess. However, I feel that the matter might be

covered

in a footnote. Let me know what you

think about

this.

•I am also troubled by the

citation from Stalin on p. 16 of FILM IN TUE BATTLE

OF IDEAS-- not on purely political grounds, but because

feel it is a rather arbitrary. and doctrinnaire

statement. I think I should rewrite this page, using

about the same space for a somewhat less sweeping

statement of the class hold upon the superstructure.

is soon as possible, meanwhile.

I should welcome further suggestions from you. I wonder 1f

an author's preface

would be of

day value?
