Congo Oil Refinery

Following is sequence events last weeks in Consortium attempts

get their refinery proposal approved:

1.

Last week Texaco representative reported to Ambassador

that Adoula had asked Consortium to place Bolikongo on company

board. Consortium replied that this might eventually be done

in some form.

2. Mobil representative reported to Embassy officers May 21

that an intermediary of Kasongo, First Vice Premier and

Acting 'Prime Minister, had asked Consortium for two and half

million dallar bribe to put over refinery proposal. This

request according to Mobil representative turned down firmly

but Consortium offered him assistance in creation plastics

plant as adjunct to refinery whigh Kasongo has also requested.

Mobil representative also said he was sure Adoula and others

had taken bribes from ENI. (Comment:

Neither Embassy nor CAS

has received any information tending confirm Mobil representa-

tive's claim as it concerns Adoula..

There is evidence that

others in government may have received favors from ENI.)

Maya 2

to explain USG concern over delay: in coming to a decision

on Consortium proposal. Kasongo stated he concerned over

possible production in excess of country's requirements

and ability to export but assured Embassy officer proposal

would be accepted (va passer).

4.

Mobil representative learned from Minister Finance

Bamba that Council of Ministers meeting May 22 considered

Consortium proposal but put off making decision. Bamba

told him that he now expected considerable delay before

decision made.

5. Mobil representative then told me he expected Mobil

and possibly other companies involved would now kick off

high pressure campaign which would include publishing in:

world press that Adoula's principal economic advisor

ยก (Tona-Masea Deputy Director BCE) is president of the Italian

Congo Refinery Company to emphasize corrupt nature Adoula

government. Can Department make inquiries with head office

US companies whether this latter project has backing of

home offices or is reflection local manager's disappointment
