FACT SHEET ON NAVAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE, 1960-64

With regard to the last two paragraphs of the undated request

received in the Office of the Secretary of Defense on March 20, 1978,

the Naval Investigative Service has been unable to identify any

personnel presently or formerly associated with its Service, or its

predecessor organizations, who were involved in the

activities described.

In general, the monitoring of activities or the utilization of sources

within the Cuban anti-Castro groups in Miami and New Orleans during

the period 1960 to 1964 was under the primary jurisdiction of the

Federal Bureau of. Investigation (FBI)

and the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) .

The NIS was established in 1966 under the Naval Intelligence

or mand fine tel gone branch long, ye one suring en

Command (NIC). At that time, the Service assumed the basic mission

investigations of Navy military and civilian personnel and Department

of Defense civilian contractor personnel for security clearance.

Contacts with both current and former NIS personnel knowledgeable of

the activities of both Op-921D and Op-921E during the period in question

revealed no recollection of assignment of agents or other employees to

maintain sources or otherwise investigate or monitor the Cuban anti-

Castro groups in

those cities.

Their recollection was that the FBl and

CIA did investigate such activities.

As

further background, it is noted that the establishment of the

Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in the early 1960's created shifts

of mission and personnel from ONI to that organization.

Prior to the

establishment. of the DIA, the structure of ONI included, in addition

to the above-mentioned Security Division (Op-921), the Intelligence

Production Division (Op-922) and the Administrative Division (Op-923) .

The former, Op-922, was sometimes referred to as the Foreign Intelli-

gence Division and most of its functions were transferred to DIA."

That transfer of functions also included

transfers of ONI personnel

and records.

OP-922H was the branch responsible for collection and

dissemination of foreign intelligence. A knowledgeable individual

currently assigned with the NIC stated that the activities of Op-922H

included interviews of anti-Castro Cubans at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but

noted that any necessary contacts or utilization of anti-Castro Cubans

in Miami or New Orleans were required to be coordinated through the

FBI or the CIA, because of the jurisdiction of those organizations in

those geographical locations.

FACT SHEET ON APRIL 12 REQUESTS CONCERNING LEE HARVEY OSWALD

The following information has been provided by the Naval

Investigative Service and responds to those portions of the April 12,

requests by the Select Committee for all records regarding: Lee

Harvey Oswald; any and all records concerning.or referring to investi-

gations into Oswald's background conducted by the 112th Military

Intelligence Group, circa 1963; a detailed statement explaining why

a photograph of Oswald in the possession of the Navy was contained

in an envelope marked "Received 14 Nov 1963" and "CIA 77978," and

answers to other questions regarding actions in connection with the

photograph.

A written list of those persons who were either connected with,

responsible for, or knowledgeable about the Office of Naval Intelli

gence (ONI) file pertaining to Oswald is attached, as Appendix A.

All available records held by the NIS pertaining to Lee Harvey

Oswald have previously been made available to the Select Committee,

with

the exception of records which were originated by or under the

release authority of the Department of State, the Office of the Attorney

reterred to those agencies for treessi

The

latter records were

to those agencies for processing and a direct response to

the Select Committee.

The NIS holds no records concerning or referring

to investigations

into Oswald's background by the 112th Military Intelligence Group.

Copy pages of the NIS file numbered 253 through 255 (previously for-

warded to the Select Committee) consists of a U.S. Continental Army

Command (USCONARC) message.

It contains information concerning

Oswald which was provided

to the "112th INTC GP'' by an Assistant Chief

of Police with the Dallas

Police Department.

Enclosure (1) to Appendix B is a copy of the envelope which the

Select Committee referred to in connection with a photograph of Oswald.

The notations on the envelope refer to a Chief of Naval Operations

(CNO) message with a date/time group of 251800Z October 1963, which

readdressed a CIA teletype numbered 77978.

The ONI file on Oswald,

which is the file maintained by the NIS, did not contain a copy of

the CNO message in question, and it is not known why a copy of it

was not contained therein.

On 25 April 1978 a representative of NIS

obtained a copy of ClA teletype number 77978 of 24 October 1963

(enclosure (2), appendix B). That copy is in the format in which the

CIA has released it to the public in response to Freedom of Information

Act requests. Enclosure (2), is addressed to the Department of the

NW 55923 DocId: 32260796 Page

Navy; refers to a ClA teletype number 74673 of 10 October 1963

(referring the possible presénce of Oswald in Mexico City), and requests

that two copies of the most recent photograph of Oswald be provided to

the ClA for purposes of determining whether he and the individual in

Mexico City were one and the same.

Enclosure (3) to appendix C is a

copy of CIA teletype number 74673 of 10 October 1963. It was also

obtained from the CIA on 25 April 1978, and is in the format in which

the ClA has released it to the public in response to Freedom of

Information Act requests. The ONI file on Oswald contained a copy

of a CNO message with a date/time group of 102012Z October 1963, which

readdressed CIA teletype number 74673. A copy of that CNO message was

one of the documents referred by NIS to the ClA on 15 August 1977.

To respond directly to the Select Committee's questions, the

reason that a photograph of Oswald was at one time contained in an

envelope marked "Received 14 Nov 1963" and "CIA 77978" appear to be

that it was obtained as a result of the request of the ClA set forth

in Enclosure (2) to appendix B.

There is no documentation in the

Oswald file revealing the manner in which the identification photo-

graph of Oswald was obtained. References to the photograph appear on

copy pages numbered 268, 278, and 282 of the material that was for-

warded to the Select Committee. Those documents are dated 22 and 23

November 1963, the day of and the day following the assassination of

President Kennedy. The references to the photograph on the copy page

numbered 278 indicated that Admiral Taylor, who was then the Director

of Naval Intelligence (DNI), would "....require at least two extra

copies of the photograph of Oswald, for forwarding by DNI to Mexico

City, by mail, and for Mr. McCone."

On 25 April 1978, the identification photograph of Oswald which

to Mexico City, and the envelope in which it was

mailed, were viewed at CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia. The

to a piece of paper

indicating it had been received at 1530, Mexico City time, on

26 November 1963. The envelope indicated it was mailed, Air Mail-

Special Delivery, by CNO (Op-923M) to an individual at the Embassy

of the United States of America, Mexico City, and was postmarked on

23 November 1963.

(In 1963, Op-923M was the administrative code for

1963, C

the General Services Branch, Administrative Division, ONI.)

PERSONS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE ONI FILE ON OSWALD

For purposes. of providing background in regard. to the list of

persons who were connected with, responsible for, or knowledgeable about

the ONI file. on Oswald, it is necessary to understand the structure of

the ONl during the period

starting when Oswald defected to Russia (1959),

to the time of the assassination of President Kennedy (1963). During

that period of time, the ONI (Op-92) consisted primarily. of three divi-

sions, the Security Division (Op-921), the Intelligence Production

Division (Op-922), and the Administrative Division (Op-923). As explained

in the fact sheet on the. NIS, the Naval Investigative Service was estab-

lished in 1966, at which time.the.personnel and basic mission of what

had. previously been known as. the Investigations Branch (Op-921D) and the

Counterintelligence. Branch (Op-921E) of the Security Division, ONI were

assumed. There was no ONI file on Oswald prior to his defection to

Russia. Because of his inactive duty/civilian status from. that time on,

the primary investigation jurisdiction in. regard. to. the counterintel-

ligence interest in him rested with the FBl. This is the reason the

bulk of the ONl file on Oswald consisted of other agency and administra-

tive documents,

and newspaper clippings.

The primary responsibility for

monitoring the file within ONI was with the Counterintelligence Branch

(Op-921E), or, more specifically, the Programs Section (Op-921E2) of the

Counterintelligence Branch. In reviewing the file in regard to identi-

fication of individuals who originated administrative documentation for

signature by individuals further up the chain of command, the names of

three junior naval officers appear. This indicates that they probably

had the period between Oswald's defection and the assassination. The

file identifies those officers as Lieutenant Junior Grade G. M. Fredrick-

son in 1960, Lieutenant Junior Grade P. C. LeSourd in 1962, and Ensign

J. A. Hazelton in 1963. Other individuals who, because of their positions

within the ONI, or more particularly, their positions within ONI at the

time of the assassination of President Kennedy, would have become con-

nected with and knowledgeable about the file are:

Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor, USN (Retired), the DNI (Op-92)

at the time of the assassination;

Captain Robert P. Jackson, Jr., USNR (Retired), the Assistant

DNI for Security (Op-921) at the time of. assassination;

Captain Jack 0. Johnson, USN (Retired), the Executive Officer

to Captain Jackson at the time of the assassination;

Captain John C. Lacy, USNR (Retired), Head, Counterintelligence

Branch (Op-921E) in 1959;

•

Commander William H. Clark, USNR (retired), Head Counterintel-

ligence Branch (0p-921E) in: 1963;

FACT SHEET ON LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S SERVICE IN THE MARINE CORPS

requested in undated letter received June T, 1978)

C.1. Oswald's level of security clearance was "confidential."

On September 11, 1959, a Security Termination Statement (OPNAV FORM

5511-14) was executed by Oswald.

C.2. Oswald was separated from his unit overseas due to hospitali-

zation from October 27, 1957 through November 15, 1957, and again from

October 7, 1958 through October 15, 1958.

Oswald did not sail from Yokosuka, Japan, on September 16,

1958. He remained aboard NAS, Atsugi as part of the MAG-11 rear

C.3. Oswald was confined at hard labor from June 27, 1958 until

he rejoined his unit on August 13, 1958.

For further clarification, Oswald received a sentence for

20 days confinement in April 1958 as a result of a Summary Courts

Martial. The confinement was suspended for six months.

If Oswald's

conduct was satisfactory for the period of suspension the sentence

would not have been executed. Oswald committed another offense in

June 1958, received another Summary Courts Martial and was awarded

confinement at hard labor for 28 days.

This second offense caused

the suspension of the first sentence to be vacated resulting in an

accumulation of 48 days confinement at hard labor minus any credit

for good behavior.

The offenses in April and June 1958 were those of:

Violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military

Justice; Violate a lawful general order by having in his possession

2. Violation of Article 117, Uniform Code of

Military Justice; Wrongfully used provoking words to a Staff

Non-Commissioned Officer.

FACT SHEET ON RADIOGRAPH REQUEST

With respect to the May 9, 1978, request for access to

radiographs taken the week of November 22, 1963, at Bethesda Naval

Hospital by the same unit used to take radiographs at President

Kennedy's autopsy, hospital personnel have reported that none of

the radiographs are annotated to indicate the particular instrument

used; thus, no means are available to determine which radiographs

were taken

on the same unit as that used during the President

Kennedy autopsy. Additionally, the radiographs unit used during

the aforementioned autopsy is no longer in use and after a search

could not be located.
