SU"JECT: "elay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the delay (ly the Mexico |
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book a a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in my view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October
convers ation would have been picked up on the morning
2nd of October. ‘The Russian language portion would*ha
to the Russ ian/English transcriber on the 3rd of-Ottober. ‘he
trans lation would have been returned the folla’
at which time, the Soviet case officer woyhd havea ked for
the photographic coverage. ‘That coveragi “would not have been
in the station before the 7th since the, was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and id@‘was, ‘picked up probably on
the 4th, processed and passed ti “Station on the next work
day which would have been M ictober.

3. Later the. film was en out of the camera every day
but at that time, the filmstayed in the camera until a full 4
rotl was completed which might take three or four days.

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is
of the name alone but that wasn't the wa Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photograthic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage. ..s ometimes_there_was..a U.S. automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of
justifying a project ty the number of dis patches, cables or
reports produced.

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 “Untit

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations ‘had sub-crypts under’ project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram)
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental ;
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta~
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Varren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest. left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral we ept operation,

LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American SS picer. A recruited

Mexican agent, who had a semiofficial a el selected letters

from a subagent employed by the. ane postal system.

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip- 4

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of ;
foreigners. Their. agents were west | and corrupt. A Station
officer trained a nunber of them in name tracing and travel control. In
1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because. of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A i

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

taps. The Mexicans s ae connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czeth lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were, typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

coasisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Chancoty 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer ‘had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene (in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly * ‘this man
(the American), “* showed him a letter imWwhich'he”(the

favor of Cuba

‘hint the visa without

the Russian visa and now the sn't know what to do

with him, because he has ae r°’the answer from

iN

Washington.

DURAN: ..with them also, b roblem with him (the American)
is that he does anyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very diff: Ye hin a visa, because he was
thinking of § sing his visa, because he knew it was

going to takes" fong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~” now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, -this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It.was no bother, thank you very much.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulate 15-60-S5

+ Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Item 74, page 2

én unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Enbassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
kmow what day the boat "KALONIA’ will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-representatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information..’First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet. Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned out=%o. be: the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate aidthe address. After
making a call to the Consulate and learnin& that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE vent t@ the. saddress to get the needed
information.)

Just after 1600-hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.: She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

THETION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

Action Required: Please advise re negatives

In view of recent reopening of the publicity regarding
Lee Harvey OSWALD and WOFACT evidence, Headquarters would
like to determine whether the Station still has on hand

the negatives from which the prints available at Headquarters
were made of the unidentified "mystery man” coming out of
both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies.
on file, it is requested that they remain so, and that they
be forwarded Headquarters for retention rather than
destroyed if the latter action is ever contemplated.

Dear Dick: = 5 si

: DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH
WASHINGTON

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some
from the White House Staff, nave revealed that, though GIA and the
FHI have detailed. records concerning Americans who have been recruited
ae intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be
a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries
who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCID l/2,
these. persons might be described as those who have either been
capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose
desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited “:
for communist propaganda purposes, This would mean that no attention :
need be paid to Anericans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual
US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the
"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

. the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18
months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
possibly expand this list for the usa of interested Bureaus of, ‘the
Department. ” one

With regard to that, Mearaguan's, ellegations that the men was in the

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of September. There is a
record showing entry into Mexico on Septexber 26. On about the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist card. We do lmow he was in -

He was last seen by the landlady . Now we have immigration records showing hin
