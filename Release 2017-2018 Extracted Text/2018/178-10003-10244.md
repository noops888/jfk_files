1. Summary and Conclusion

: =
E In late 1960 and 1961, the United States, having
abandoned its policy of nonintervention in the Dominican
Republic, sought to bring about the overthrow of the regime

of..Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo and the establishment of

a moderate successor government. To accomplish this result

several measures were undertaken on the diplomatic level

and the Special Group (predecessor of the Forty

approved a program of covert action as well. At their

direction the CIA encouraged a group of internal dissidents

along with several exile organizations. On May 30, 1961,

members of the internal group assassinated Trujillo.
There was no direct American participation in the

assassination. The idea originated with the Dominicans;

they acquired some of the weapons on their own; and they

On the other hand, CIA and State Department officers

in the Dominican Republic were in regular contact with the

plotters before the assassination, and they were well aware

of the group's lethal intentions. The CIA had told the group

o£ practical problems with several earlier assassination plans;
d to train a member of the group in the use of

it had offere

explosives to kill Trujillo.

As a gesture of American support, three revolvers and

three carbines, along with limited supplies of ammunition,

vere passed to the plotters about two months before the
assassination. One of the carbines was reportedly left at
-the scene of the crime. Four submachineguns were also sent
- to the Dominican Republic by diplomatic pouch. They were with-
‘held from the plotters because of last-minute State Department

objections.
It appears that high-level State Department and

White House officials first learned guns had been provided to
potential assassins some six weeks after the transfer, and
about two and a half weeks prior to Trujillo's death. A state-

ment of policy was prepared and approved by the President,

‘ye must not run risk of U.S. association with

;reading
ce U.S. as a matter of general

political assassination, sin
policy cannot Gondone assassination. This last principle is

overriding and must prevail in doubtful situations." The

consumed about two weeks. There is no evidence of any
effort during this period to recover the weapons or other-
wise interfere with the assassination plans. The policy
statement was cabled to the Dominican Republic on May 29,
the day before the successful assassination attempt. Both
the Consul General’ and the CIA Station Chief in Ciudad
Trujillo promptly protested this change in the policy which
they had followed in the belief it had been approved by

appropriate authority. Before these cables were received

-in Washington, Trujillo was dead. .

2. (Proposed) General Conclusion and Recommendation

The Comhission concurs in the position taken in the

policy statement. We have concluded that there was an

improper level of American involvement in the death of

Generalissimo Trujillo. That is so even though the assassins

might have been able to procure equivalent weapons from

other sources. We also conclude that despite the apparent -

good faith of the persons concerned, there was inadequate

consideration of the risks of such involvement and inadequate

supervision and coordination of the operation.

We recommend that in the future, weapons should be

supplied to plotters of a coup or revolution only in, the
rarest of circumstances, if at all. In passing on such

‘activities the approving authority should consider carefully
the potential aamage to the foreign relations of the nation and
the feelings of the American people if such activities become ‘
known. In our judgment eventual disclosure is inevitable.
The procedures of the CIA should be modified to re~
quire the concurrence of the Department of State before weapons,
ammunition, explosives, and similar items are transmitted by
U.S.y including

‘diplomatic pouch. The treaty obligations of the

“particularly those under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic

n should be observed and fulfilled in goo

3- The Chronology : aa

a. The Background i

Rafael Trujillo came to power in the Dominican Re-

public. in 1930. By 1960 he was notorious because of the corrupt. and:
regressive nature of his regime, because of his systematic
use of torture and murder as tools of government, and. because
of his intervention in the affairs of other nations. The
country was in considerable turmoil as the result of several
attempts to overthrow the government, sponsored by other

Latin American countries.

The policy of the United States at the beginning of

IVUED- THe NOUs- KdOooLOHE—-

1960 was to refrain from actions which would hasten Trujillo's
downfall but to identify, develop, and encourage a moderate
group which would take power in the event of Trujillo's death,
flight, or overthrow, This policy of non-intervention,. although

clearly required by treaty, convinced many Latin Americans

AUWdGIT duos *y-€

“that the United States supported and maintained the Trujillo

i
|

regime. Leaders such as President Betancourt of Venezuela,

whose support the United States badly wanted in connection with
operations against Castro, conditioned their support’on U.S.
assistance in toppling Trujillo. In April the President approved
contingency planning for a more active U.S. role in the event’

the political situation in the Dominican Republic continued to.

b. The Rifles

In May the American Ambassador to the Dominican Re-

public returned to Washington for consultations. Both State Départ-

ment and CIA files indicate that he reported the dissidents
needed weapons, particularly a "small number of high-powered
rifles with telescopic lenses." The Ambassador has no present

_recollection.of any such request. He is confident that he

RAO OEOHE 9

made no serious effort to obtain them, Nevertheless, the
request went forward. Near the end of June, according to
CIA files, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-
American Affairs approved the provision of "a small number
of sniper rifles or other devices for the removal of key
Trujillo people from the scene," and requested that they be
supplied at the earliest possible moment. Neither the CIA
-officer who obtained this approval nor the Assistant Secretary,

now both retired, has any recollection of this meeting.

On June 24, 1960, Trujillo sponsored an unsuccessful

attempt on the life of the President of Venezuela; as a

result the United States and other OAS countries severed

diplomatic relations in August. Consular relations were
retained.
fhe Commission Staff interviewed the foreign service

officer who served as Deputy Chief of Mission before the

severance of relations, and as Consul General thereafter.

- assassination plans in mid 1960, although they did speak of

they lived. It was not until early 1961, as he recalls, that
the dissidents began formulating specific plans to KEL , =
“Trujillo. The cables and memoranda of the period tend to &
confirm this recollection. q
Nevertheless, the CIA continued at intervals during §
1960 to discuss with the dissidents means for the assassination "
of Trujillo. ‘A memorandum in October 1960 reflects that the \
dissidents planned to kill Trujillo with a bomb, detonated from

a remote point, and then to take over the nation by means

, of an armed uprising, coordinated with other paramilitary

action. A more detailed proposal along similar lines appears

to have been provided by the dissidents in December.

On December 29, 1960, the Deputy Director for Plans

presented the Special Group with a program for covert action
to bring about Trujillo's overthrow. A portion of the program

called for Agency and consular officials in Ciudad Trujillo i

to continue to work with the internal dissidents to promote
an uprising and the establishment of a moderate pro-uU.S.
successor to the Trujillo regime. The plan, as initially
approved by the Special Group, contained no provision for

supplying arms or explosives to the internal dissidents.

DHL HOUT. 4dOd0L0HE

Two weeks later, the Department of State, on its ow
notion, obtained Special Group consent to have the internal
dissidents furnished “limited supplies of small arms and other
: equipment," meaning explosives, subject to the condition i

_that. these materials be provided to the dissidents at a point

outside the country itself. The internal State Department

KUWdGIT adios a aTwuaD

memorandum which led to this proposal stated there would be
no thought of toppling the government by any such "minor
measure," but some sabotage potential would be placed in the
hands of the pro-U.S. opposition with a corresponding boost
to their morale and their penton of the United States. The
station and the consulate were informed of the Special Group

The Commission finds no reason to believe that any

member of the Special Group intende@ to authorize the furnish-

.ing of assassination weapons. However, those CIA officials

who had been involved in dealings with the dissidents very
likely believed that the Special Group had authorized support

of the planned assassination and armed uprising.

_.d. ‘Revolvers ae
During the early months of 1961 the CIA Station

and the consular officials in Ciudad Trujillo kept in close touch

with ‘the dissidents, and they were aware of their various schemes

to assassinate Trujillo. Although these officials apparently
took no active role in ‘the development of plans, they dia Wa

on occasion discuss and criticize plans developed by the

dissidents. In mid-February, two members of the dissidents’

"action Group", which was to carry out the actual assassination,
came to the United States. They met with both CIA and State
Department officers. During these meetings they stated

repeatedly that the key to the success of the plot would be the

assassination of Trujillo. The evidence is insufficient to

: permit a conclusion how far this knowledge went within the

State Department.

In March matters took an active turn. In a cablé

on March 4, a letter on March 16, and an airgram on March 22

the Consul General in Ciudad Trujillo reported that plans
for Trujillo's assassination.were coming to a head. He

requested additional authority to supply the pro-U.s,.

‘dissidents with weapons.

HW 50955

Similar requests were made by the CIA Station

Chief of his headquarters. Three times headquarters responded

that it could not comply with these requests because the
restrictions imposed by the Special Group precluded the

introduction of arms into the Dominican Republic by |

Americans.
On March 22, the CIA Station Chief renewed his

request that headquarters send him three .38 calibre revolvers and

ammunition by. diplomatic pouch. He stated that without
some show of support the United States would lose the
dissident group entirely, while if it supplied weapons it

might have some control over the timing of their use.

favor" passing the weapons. and ammunition.

Another meeting was held with the Department of

State on March 31. ‘The State Department memorandum makes no

mention of any discussion either of the furnishing of ammunition
or of authority to pass the weapons, but the Deputy Director

for Plans granted authority to pass the carbines the same

day. Both the State Department liaison officer, who prepared
the memorandum of the meeting, and the Consul General are clear
in their recollection that the State Department in Washington
‘did not learn of the pass of the carbines until the Consul ‘
General was in Washington several weeks after the pass took
place. Nothing in CIA files indicates that this decision was
‘coordinated in advance with the Department of State. It is
possible that the CIA understood its initial authorization
with respect to the handguns to extend to the carbines as well,
It is also possible that CIA decided the Special Group

restriction on importation of weapons did not apply, as the

carbines were already inside the Dominican Republic.

CIA cabled its Station Chief on April 5 to request

the Consul General not to comment in his correspondence with the

Department that the arms and ammunition.were being passed.

A reassuring reply from the Consul General was received two

days later. The CIA.Station Chief, who would not have been
involved in any coordination at the headquarters level,
Speculated that this injunction may have been designed to
keep the State Department from knowing "officially" that
the weapons were being passed.
; It is clear that the coordination on the deci-

sion to provide the carbines was inadequate. It is impossible

to determine from this evidence where the fault lies.

£. Submachine Guns

As early as March 20, the consulate and the sta-

tion in Ciudad Trujillo had been informed that the assassins in-

the plan followed some two months later, Although the plan
originally called for Trujillo's dispatch inside his mistress!
xesidence using silenced weapons, the group requested five

M-3 submachineguns and 1500 rounds of ammunition for self

ee in case the assassination plans went awry and there

was a £irefight with Trujillo's security forces. In its

March 25 cable, headquarters replied that it was prepared to

sprovide these weapons when the dissidents developed the

‘-capacity to receive them at sea or in a cache on the coast,

but that for security reasons they could not be sent

The Chief of Station returned to Washington for

consultations in early April. He was able to convince his

superiors that the pouch was the only feasible and secure

means of getting the weapons into the Dominican Republic

for delivery to, the dissidents. The Deputy pirector for

Plans approved on April 10, and the pouch was sent on April 14

dissidents and they never did so.

On May 2, as the result of repeated entreaties
from the station and the consulate, the: Deputy Director for Plans
approved a cable for the DCI's release, stating that as it
appeared the Action Group was prepared to act whether or not
the submachineguns were. provided, the station was authorized
to pass them for the additional protection of the group.

In mid-May, as a result of increasing indications

that events in the Dominican Republic were Teaching a climax, |

the White House requested situation reports and contingency

plans. This exercise was overseen by a member of the National

Security Council Staff. A CIA briefing paper prepared for this

purpose stated that the three revolvers and the three carbines

had been passed to the dissidents for their use in personal
defense “attendant to their projected efforts to neutralize
Trujillo." The report implied that both the revolvers and :
the ammunition had been in the consulate with the carbines,

and therefore the limitations. on the Special Group authorization

technically did not apply.

the reasons why the United States should -not be involved

On May 24, the State Department liaison officer
provided the Under Secretary with a draft cable, stating that
the need to dissociate the United States from obvious inter-
vention, and even more so from political assassination,
errode the need to secure cre@it with the Dominican dissidents

and with Latin America generally. This draft was approved

at high levels in the CIA and the State Department, and was
sent to the White House for Presidential review. After some

xedrafting in the White House, the final version in another
hand, stated “We must not run risk of U.S. association with '

political assassination, since U,S, as a matter of general
policy cannot condone assassination." This version*was
approved by the President in Paris and cabled to the Dominican
Republic. It arrived the day before Trujillo's death on May 30.
‘on June 1 the State Department instructed its Consul General,

if ‘he could do so "most inconspicuously", to destroy any

‘records concerning contacts with the plotters and any related

thatters.
