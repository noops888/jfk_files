This 13 further to, and in completion of, my

Interim memorandum of a few weeks ago.

2.

The attachment is a detailed review in narrative,

chronological order - together with appropriate comment

ary - of our extensive holdings on the OSWALD case that

have a bearing on the matter of shotographs taken by

Mexico City Station only and 15 October 1903 of ar

Unidentified Indiviaual.

As a consequence of a combina

tion of analytical error, misjudgement and under the

stress of an urgent desire to contribute to the develop

ment of the investigation of the assassination, a

cropped versior of one of the photographs of the

Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of

evidence in the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an

FBI representative in Dallas.

The succescive vicissi-

tudes which have now made this event a

cause celebre

right down to

the present moment are

decaiied in the

narrative.

of President Kennedy (hereinafter cited as the Warren Commission) and

introduced into evidence as Odum Exhibit No. 1." The photograph

4. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of events

at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted In

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped

photo of-Jack: RUBY the day before he murdered her son. (A further

complication compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that

when she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance

before the Commission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in

a slightly different manner.)

a photo of Osbrio. A careful revier dó ull coverage, voice intercept,

as well as photographic, of both the soviet and Cuban Embassies was

conducted by the Station on 22 and

23 lovenber 1963 after the

ascassina-

tion, going

back to matertals from August 1963. It is, therefore, firm

that there was no ClA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his

Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City, Moreover, although it had made a

cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD

in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters--which did not

have one either--before 22 November 1963.

of interest to the Department of State)--turned up matches based on

matches were reported to Headquarters on 23 November 1963. Analysis

memorably poor Russian spoke by OSWALD) could not be made because the

means of acquisition and the volume of the Information precludes anything

but the spot reporting of items judged by the monitor to be of more than

ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in surmary logs. Full texts of

selected items require consultation of the tape and either a full tran-

scription or full translation ur both. Photo coverage tends to become

available in quantity lots which requires scanning and selection on a

rapid and accelerated. basis in four or five day' "peäks." One of the

"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more speedy

review and reporting.of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of

a name. This was precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa-

tions on l October with the Surfet Embassy, during which the speaker said

he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to

Headquarters in its first indication on OSWALD cn 8 October 1963.

13. The Mexico Station did one more thing in its 8 October report

on Lee OSWALD based on its 1 October voice intercepts: it coupled the

data with descriptive information it had acquired from a sensitive

• collateral source--a photograph of a male individual, apparently an

American, who was observed entering the Soviet Embassy on 1 October.

The Station reported this detail on the 8th. as a matter of coincident

fact. The Station did not assert or suygest that the data deduced from

the photo was in fact OSWALD, or indeed, was

in any way related to OSWALD.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of His Mexico Cise Stay

the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)

totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the after.

15. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

talking there because she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet :

Embassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa, then

the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him a visa without further

paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The American, she

says, wants to know with whom he had talked there because he says

he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

require waiting a long time for his visa to the Soviet Union while

the. thing is that if his wife right now were in' Washington she

would receive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet

Union; to return to her country; she is going to receive her visa in

Washington but having this visa, she could conmunicate to any place

this permission, for example here or.

any place she could receive it

Silvia DURAN says certainly and they cannot give a letter efther

because they do not know if the visa will be approved. The Soviet

says he cannot give a letter or recommendation either because he

does not know him (the American) and asks to be excused for

bothering her. Silvia DURAN says that is all right and many thanks.

matter on logical or substantive grounds, or both; bearing in mind that

the Sovtet Echessy received many calls pertaining to visa matters.

On the 27th at 1037 hours the Soviet Embassy received a call from

an unknown indiridual speaking Spanish who said he wanted visas.to go to

Odessa.

He was told the Consul was not in and to call back at 1130.

OSWALD is known to have arrived at the Flecha Roja bus terminal on bus

#516 at circa 1000 hours on. the 27th.

It was, therefore, possible for

him to have made this call.

But granting this, it is unreasonable to

believe the calls were OSWALD's for the

following reasons:

a.

The caller wanted visas, and specifically

for Odessa.

OSWALD wis seeking a visa and never in any

context did he specify

the Blaul sea port of Odessa as a destination.

the

27th. The lack of

coverage on the Cuban installation. is explainable: the camero..

based on the recollection of officers still in service in Head-

quarters, was down on the 27th because

of mechanical malfunction,

which was in course of correction. Why OSWALD was missed-in his

probable entry to the Soviet installation on the 27th is not yet

explained, but no technical operation of that kind is infallible.

• D. 28 September 1963 (Saturday): [Note: Both the Cuban and

Soviet-Embassies were closed to the public. on Saturdays.. Photo-

graphic coverage was normally suspended Saturdays and Sundays.]

D.

The call was directed to the correct Soviet consular

number:

15-60-55.

On ! October, OSWALD first called the wrong

number, 15-69-87 (the MA's number), and had to redirect his call to

the correct number, 15-60-55.

It seems unlikely he would have made

what would have been his initial call, on Friday the ?7th, to the

correct number, and called the incorrect number on l' October.

There is every reason to believe from the context of the

intercepts, para 15, a-e above, that OSWALD's first destination

after arrival and check-in to his hotel, was a visit to the Cuban.

Embassy.

d. The use of the Spanish language would exclude OSWALD unless

he made use of an intermediary, which seems unlikely from what is

known of his modus operandi.

English, called the Soviet Embassy and asked

for a visa.

previously. Me secured the address from Mrs. DURAN and she called

the Soviet Consulate presumably to permit him to give them the .

telephone of the Consul, 15-60-55.

The requestor says:

One moment

please; I'll have to get a pencil to write the number down.

They issue

the visa there?

The Soviet:

That depends on your corversation.

I don't

know about this business.

The requestor asks for the number again.

Soviet gives him the number and tells him to ask for the Consul of

Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

The relevance of this intercept to OSWALD is excludable on three

grounds:

The use of broken Spanish.

OSWALD throughout used broken

Russian or English.

He had no competance in Spanish to handle a

conversation of this kind.

The substance of the request indicates a visa request in

the first stages of initiation.

OSWALD had developed his matter

with the Cubans and the Soviets the previous Saturday to a point

well beyond the stage indicated by the substance of this call.

twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a guard-...

and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV. There

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October: If the follow-

Ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should be. From the context

of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to

the Embassy, His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of

the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were

concerned with whether any reply had been received fran Washington.

Under those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

would-have gone to-the Sortet: Embassy on that date.

installation. On the chance there could do an association between the

identification data derived from the voice intercept and the descriptive

data derived fron the photograph, the Station reported the two elements

as separate facts in its. cable to Headquarters on 8 October.

19. The Station's action was not unusual and really amounted to an

analytic "quantum leap," justified by the primitive and inflatory status

of the OSWALD identification. Many examoles of a similar kind of thing

can be found in the day-to-day record of Station-Headquarters correspon-

dence and reporting.

anything new regarding a telegran to hashington.

OBYECKOV upon checking said nothing had been

Apparent age 35, athletic, build, circa 6 feet,

Station.

21. On 10 October 1963 at 2012Z time the WH Division responsible

for action disseminated this report to the Department of State, the FBI,

and the Navy Department by routine electrical transmission, adding some

collateral details drawn fran a preliminary file review:

(1) On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive

source in Mexico reported that an American male,

who identified himself as Lee OSWALD, contacted

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring

whether the Embassy has received any news can-

cerning a telegram which had heen sene to

Washington. The American was described as

approximately 35 years old, with an athletic

build, about 6 feet tall, with a "receding"

hairline.

•(2)

It is believed that OSkALD may be identical

to lee Henry (sic) USbALD, born on 18 October 1939

in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine

who defected to the Soviet Union in Octöber 1959

and later made arrangements through the United

States Embassy in Moscow to return to the United

States with his Russian-born wife, Marina

Nikolaevna PUSAKOVA [sic) and their child.

(3) The Information in paragraph. (1) is being

disseminated to your representatives

in Mexico City:

Any further information received on this subject

will be furnished you. This information is being

made available to the Irmigration and Naturalization

Service.

22. Although the reaction of the Headquarters desk was "by the

book" and in good time, there were a rumber of errors in this advisory

to the departments which, on the

record, were concerned with the OSWALD

case:

3. OSWALD's middle name mas misgiven:

"terry" for Harvey.

The reason for this mistake is simplicity itself. The sheed openiny

the file on OSKALD

on 9 Deceriber 1960 had been erroneous ly inscrited

"CSWALD, Lée Henry." That sheet-unchanged except for the notation of

the error--is still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

D. Mis wife's maiden name was misspelled: "PUSAKOVA" for PUSAKOVA.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters communications throughcut. the mönth). More important was:

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with

a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual

observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to

Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive

fact. The Station's qualification,

"appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

There can be no question that this misreading of the Mexico Station report

was an

analyst's error

which escaped detection in the coordination before

release: the descriptive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the

mark as

to be inmediately recognizable as such by the recipients in Head-

quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photos of OSWALD. (In partial

explanation, if

not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that moment ClA

had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

23. Confirmation of this judgment is provided by the contents of

the cable composed

by the same analyst and sent as of 2209Z time (two

hours later) to Mexico Station, referencing its 8 October cable:

possibly in connection with the assa sination, and referenced its

earlier messages of 8-9 and 15 October and Headquarters' reply of

10 October. The Station requested by:

"priority pouch a photo of OSWALD so that Station

can check all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forward-

•Ing soonest coples of only visitor to Soviet Embassy

on 1 October who could be identical with OSWALD."

28: It is clear that Mexico Station had forgotten that according

to its own communication the unidentified male in the photo was of

"apparent age 35 and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded

by Headquarters on 10 October precluded the Identity with OSWALD of the

person whom they regarded as the "only visitor to the Soviet Embassy on

)'October who could be identical. " .

29. The Station meanwhtle had begun an exhaustive and accelerated

review of all its technical and photographic Intelligence. A dispatch.

was prepared in accordance with the indication given

in the cable of

22 November, cited in paragraph 25 above.

The dispatch noted that

photo coverage of the unidentified individual had turned up on 4 and

15 October at the Sortet and Cuban Embassies, respectively. The text

of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch read:

"J. Attached are coples of the only photographs

"2. Copies of these photographs were shown to the

U.S. Ambassador on 22 November 1963 and a copy of

two photographs was given to Chief FBi,

Mexico, on that date .

Attached were eight photographs: four (of which two were marked

(unmarked on reverse)

showing the individual in a black shirt. It

would

seem to be logical

that the word

"sets" was probably amitted fran

paragraph two of the dispatch between the words "two" and "photographs."

30. That the Statton was working under forced draft is clearly

apparent fron the text of the dispatch, which tacked on a material fact

as a postscript. That fact was reported simultaneously by cable to

Headquarters at 0053Z time, 23 November:

"1. Mexico Station has photos same unidentified

31. Headquarters, at 0136Z time, 23 lovember 1963, asked Mexico

Station to send a staff menber with all photographs to Headquarters on

the next aval lable flight.

32. Concurrently with or before the foregoing cables to Headquarters,

the Chief of Station, Mexico City, had spoken directly by double-talk

telephone with the Western Hemisphere Chief of Division, Mr. J. C. KING,

and secured permission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden-

tified Indiridual to the Legal Attaché and to make then known to the

Ambassador.

33. What happened next Is best reflected in a personal note by the

Chief.of. Station to the WH Division Chief, mailed to the latter from

Dallas, together with copies of the photographs, by the Legal Attaches

representative who delivered then to the FBI in that city.

34. The decision to remit the photographs to the FEl in Dallas

had been made by the Anbassador, according to the Chief of Station, who

simultancously:with the FBi agent's departure reported to headquarters

by cable (0244Z time, 23 November):

"FBI agent left here 2000 local time with two copies

each of six photos of a person suspected to be

OSWALD, on a spectal flight for Dallas.. He is

35. Headquarters responded two hours later, 0422Z time,

23 November 1963, cancelling its request:

"I. No need send staffer with photos. We have

asked Navy for photos again, but Mexico can see

OSWALD's picture soonest on the press wire.

36. On the 23rd at 1729Z time, Headquarters advised Mexico City:

"The FBI says that the photos of the man

entering the Soviet Embassy which Mexico

Station,sent to Dallas were not of Lee OSWALD.

Presúme Mexico Station has double-checked

dates.of these photos and is also checking all

pertinent photos for possiblé shots of OSWALD."

37. And at this point, 2048Z time, 23 November, Mexico Station

finally agreed:

"Saw photos of Lee OSWALD on televiston night of

22 November and it obvious photos

sent to Dallas

were not identical with Lee OSWALD held in DaTas

Dates are as given on photos.

"Mexico Station is reviewing all available photos

of persons entering Soviet and Cuban Embassies."

38. Two hours later (2254Z time, 23 November 1963) the Station had

reported the results of its effort to review all available coverage:

28 September, Saturday, on which Embassy closed

and we had not had coverage

39. With this conmunication the matter of the "unidentified

individual" reaches the end of Phase 1, the key element of which

is the

conviction, at first latent, then expressed, that the photographed

individual might be identical with OSWALD. This applies especially to

the Station, though at a certain point even Headquarters moved no

rebuttal despite the hard fact that the description of CSWALD. and the

unidentified individual were quite disparate.

40. This revien has attempted to deal even-handedly with all items

in the case record that have a bearing on what happened. The operational

zeal, innovativeness, and the high conmittment of all involved,

espectally in Mexico City, speaks for itself. Equally apparent-

because of the 20/20 advantage of hindsight--is the evidence of

non-performance. It was a critical failure, for example, that no photo

of OSWALD was made available--though it was expressly requested both at

Headquarters and by the field--or that it was not more aggressively

ubriated--in a aux the more possession of a correct physical description

in

Mexico City as an impressionistic selection of the photograph on

1 Ocrober 1965 into a cause celebre today.

40. It should de clear from this factual survey that never had.

there beer a cause celebre with less intrinsic merit. It Is equally

clear from the fodts themselves that there was nothing contrived or

conspired in what happened, unless we have now descended to that point

in human values achiered under STALIN in the USSR and under HITLER In

Germany, nhere just a plain mistake is per se evidence of conspiracy.

the background sy straight cuts. Mrs. OSWALD had no recognition of the

in Mexico City on a Priter 1263, eno days after eSwilD had

left the city.

43. At this point, for the record, the cotal available photo

coverage of the unidentified individual numbers twelve (12) photográphs:

a. Five (5) taken en I October 1963, entering and exiting the

Soviet Embassy. "He is garbed in a white shirt and light-colored

(khaki-?) trousers.

•b.. Five (5) taken on $ October 1963 in front of the Soviet

high-neckline undershirt showing and dark trousers.

c. Two (2) taken on 15 October 1963 in front of the Cuban

Embassy. He is wearing a dark, collarless T-shirt or light sweater.

The negatives.of all of these are extent and are now held in Headquarters

as integral parts of. the OSWALD and related file holdings.

44. The result of ODUM's display of the photograph--to repeat, a

cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 43b, above--was

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of

her son's killer, Jack RUBY, a day before he perpetuated the deed! Again

the Warren Conmission Report (pp. 364-365, 367) exhaustively disposes

of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-

ting fact developed along the way was Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) observation,

32

SECRET

---

## Page 36

when she firally admitted befere the cormission that the ODUM photograph

was not RUBY, was that the photo had been cropued differently from the

one she had been stiown in Dallas, Inspector MALLEY's cropped version of

the ODUM photograph became Conmission Exhibft 237 (see Hearings,

V01. XVI. D. 638)

45.

The net effect of the develements in the hearings of the

Commission was to require the admissior. of the cropped photograph into

evidence in a chain of depositions beginning with ODUM, Including the

FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph used by

the Conmission in Washington), and Richard HELMS, who deposed for the.

originator. These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly

advised against the publication of the photograph in any form on the

grounds that the Soviets would be inmediately alerted to the existence

of a useful and continuing U.S. intelligence operation, and the opera-

tion would go down the drain. There were repeated cables exchanged on

this point between Headquarters and Mexico Station during

the summer

of. 1964, in particular fran 23 September to 15 October 1964 when the

Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

47. In acceding to the Conmission's request for a deposition,

Mr. HELMS, then the Deputy Director for Plans, replied affirmatively to

Mr. RANKIN by memorandum of 23 June 1964 which included

additlonal observation:

the follaving

"The Central Intelligence Agency recarmends that

-sion's report because it would jeopardize a most

confidential and productive operation. In

addition, it could be eribarrassing to the indivl.

dual Involved who as far as the Agency is aware

had no connection with dee Harvey OSWALD or the

assassination of President KENNEDY:"

48.

In this instance the needs of the Commission prevailed over

the DCI's statutory obligation to protect sources and methods. The

"Unidentifled Individual" remains to this day unidentified and there is

no credible evidence up to this time to rebut the assertion made by

Mr. HELAS in the concluding sentence-of his memorandu. to Mr... RANKIN an

23 June 1964. And

the operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.

Within a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. I and

Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet Embassy began systematic

efforts to survey the surrending buildings, ostensibly for rental

space, but clearly their inquiries vere directed to spotting possible

camera sites. The operation was continued in any case. Within a year

it had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Americans in

contact with the

Embassy--a clear sign that this category of

visitor

was being warned

away by the Soviets themselves.

49. Is could be foreseen, there has been persistent pressure by

critios of the Warren Carmission Report to exploit Odum Exhibit No. 1

and Commission

Exhibit. No. 237 for partisan interpretive púrposes. A

considerable correspondence has accumulated since

the end of 1964 1n

which the Agency has

attempted to be

responsive to these requests and.

stimultaneously, has tried to satisfy what has been its sole interest

from the inception of the matter: to protect the method of acquisition

of the photograph and the

which made the

acquisition possible.

50. Following are highlights from the correspondence during the

current phase.

a. On 16 May 1967, over the signature of the General Counsel

of the Agency, Lavrence R. HOUSTON, CIA voluntarily submitted a

statement about the photograph to Judge BAGERT of the Criminal

District Court for the Parish

of Orleans, State of Louistana.

The response dealt affirmatively with the contents of the subpoena

that nao, been delivered to the United States Marshall in the District

of Columbia, despite the fact that the subpoena could not be

executed because of the lack of jurisdiction.

Mr. HOUSTON proferred on Agency behalf categoric assur-

The Agency has repeatedly serviced requests about the

identify of the unknown individual fran Mr. Emory L. BROWN, Jr.,

Route #4, Box :82, Squankum Road, Farmingdale, New Jersey. The last

exchange of correspondence in our record covered the period:

on this occasion Mr. FENSTERWALD, who was accompanled by his

looked at the other photographs, and told us he

did know who the man was. He said he is presently

States and admitted that he had knewn OSWALD, but

Mr. FÈNSTERWALD said there was nothing .to indicate

any connection between the man in the photographs

and the assassination of President KENNEDY.

Mr. FENSTERWALD did not give us the man's name at

this time, as he said enough people had suffered

unnecessarily from allegations that they were

MP. FENSTERWALD made no reference

in his subsequent

conversations and correspondence to this allegation about the identity

of the "Unidentified indiuldual," though the claim, if true, would

be of direct evidential Interest and possibly permit us to assert

with finality what we belleve has been the fact from the beginning:

the "Unidentified Man" has nothing

to do with the OSWALD case at all.

Deir Mr. Knoche:

As you know, Ice Harvey Owwald was in Mexico City in

Into Septonbar and early October, 1963.

Shortly after

he left Mexico City a photograph was taken of in American

male and a question was raised whether or not this

male vas

Ice Harvey Oswald. The CIA and the Warren Cormission both

determined that the picturo was not of lee. Harvey Oswald

aud that the picture wis takon after Oswald leit Mexico

City.

Although portions of this record have been roleased to the

other portions have romalned classificd because

of concoins by the Cil at tho time that a rolease of the

full picture might disclose sources and mathods which the

CIA felt were not in thu national intercst to disclose at

that tine.

In light of tho false allegations about the

assassination of President konnody and the false allogations

of CIA involvement, I foel that it would be appropriate to

reconsider whether or not the ortire matter can be fully

disclosed at this tino.

I would like to receive by April 22 a full roport from

the CIA on this entiro matter.

sincerely yours,

David W.

Belin
