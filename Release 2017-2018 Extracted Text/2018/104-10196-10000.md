MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Operations Staff

SUBJECT 1 Review of ‘Agency Holdings regarding
Photograph of Unidentified Individual
in Mexico City published by the
Warren Commission :

REFERENCE : Letter dated 15 April 1975 by
Mr. David W, Belin, Executive Director
of the Commission on CIA Activities
within the United States, to
Mr. E.. Henry Knoche (copy attached to
accompanying report)

1. This-is further to, and in completion of, my
interlm memorandum of a few weeks ago.

‘2. The attachment is a detailed review in narrative,
chronological order - together with appropriate comment=
ary - of our extensive holdings-on the OSWALD case that
have a bearing on the matter of photographs taken by
Mexico City Station on(1, 4.and 15 October 1563 of an
Unidentified Individual. As a consequence of a combina-
tion of analytical error, misjudgement and under the
stress of an-urgent desire to contribute to the develop~ .
ment of the investigation of the assassinaticn, a
cropped version of one of the photographs of the
Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of
evidence in the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an ‘i
FBI representative in Dallas. The successive vicissi-
tudes which have now made this event a cause cel.
right down to the present moment are detaiied in
narrative.

3. The attached report is not intended to be an
answer to the Fensterwald/O'foole article which Belin
attaches to his memorandum. (I have prepared a paragraph=

‘4s The point of thé referenced memorandum is ‘that
consideration should be given now to “whether or not ‘the
entirésmatter canbe fully disclosed at this time." This
subitiission is designed, to make .it !possible for you, the

well beyond what has been released to the public thus far
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must
be borne’ in mind in making a decision on Nr. Belin's
question.’ To remove any question in anybedy's mind about
our good faith-in this matter, the narrative is backed up
by copies of actual documentation from our files. It
seems to me nécessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or
his representative review the documentation that backs up
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-
cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in;the matter, and there is an overall: index

Mexico City on 4 October 1963 was introduced into the ~-
Warren Commission public record. However, it was intro-
duced. into that record in two cropped versions. The
Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in
the course of their inquiry at Headquarters and in
Mexico City of the origins of the photograph, the fact
that we had additional photographs of the same individual
taken at differént times in Mexico City and on the basis
of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con-
clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to
OSWALD and the assassination.

graphs of the Unidentified Individual. Each of these are+—

had indicated in writing to Chief, CIops, that he has no
objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with
these photographs at this time. It should be noted that
Mr. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by,
Mr. Houston during.a visit to the Agency, two of the

in the Warren Commissicn report. (It is-these two that ~

recommendation is’ that,;the more we can say about this

the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to
J.C; King on 22.November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup
documentation)’, allegedly played a direct role in the
decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI
in Dallas laterally from the Field. As far as I know,
there has not been anything published about this aspect
at any time in the past nor have we had any discussions
with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.

at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment 8) which ultimately resulted in
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped
photo of Jack RUBY the day before he murdered her son. (A further
complication compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that
when she had been shown a’copy of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Commission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in

a slightly different manner.)

6. Although 1n°no way relatéd to Lee: Harvey’ OSKRLE or his stay in
Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the bale of

2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the un! sidenti tied man

an understanding of the acquisition-and handling of tre photographs by
the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertaiesd and aia with

the information it developed about OSWALD in Mexico City, topether with

Headquarters action on that information.

7. From all credible evidence known to this time (none, incidentally,
added since the exhaustively unique work of the Warren Commission),
Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (8) full days and two (2) partial days--
about 116 hours in all--in Mexico City from about 10:02 a.m. 27 September

Hotel Commercio--where he was registered under alfas. Exhaustive and

aU hotel personnel he left early and returned late each day of his stay.

Tain and allowing for the fact of late arrival and early

forwarded by Headquarters in response to a Station cabled report of

$ October which had forwarded, on a@ routine basis, what appeared to be

was indicated and deduced from technically acquired information on

as well as photographic, of both the Seviet and Cuban Embassies was
conducted by the Station on 22 ahd 23 November 1963 after the assassina-
tion, going back to materials from August 1963. It is, therefore, firm
that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his,
Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a
cabled request .on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD
in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters--which did not

14. One additional element of background must be stipulated now as
the final precondition to-understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)
of the photo of the unknown individual placed in the chain of évidence

totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the after

nooh of the.23rd when all svailable coverage had been checked?

1S. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as. follows:

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1605 hour's Mexico City time.

Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee of the Cuban
Embassy, Consular section, a receptionist, speaks with an unknown
male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia DURAN tells the.man that the
American citizen was there, the one who wants a visa for Cuba on.
his way to the Soviet Union, and he wants to know with whom he was
talking there because she (Silvia DURAN) had.-sent him to the Soviet :
Embassy. saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa, then
the Cubans (Enbassy) would also give him a visa without further
paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The Anerican, she
says, wants to know with whom he had talked there because he says
he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

Embassy says to wait a moment. A different Soviet speaks, and

There was no photographic ceverage of OSHALD's entries,
into either the Cuban or Soviet Embassies on the 27th. The lack of
coverage on the Cuban installation-is explainable: ~the camery,

The relevance of this intercept to OswaLD is excludable on three
grounds: :

a. The use of broken Spanish. OSWALO throughout used broken
Russian or English. .He had no competance in Spanish to handle a
conversation of this kind,

b., The substance of the request indicates a visa request in
the first stages of initiation, OSWALD had developed his matter

(2) Mexico Station said it had photos of a male

Apparent age 35, athletic build, circa 6 feet,

(3) No local dissemination was being made by the

Station.

21. On 10 October 1963 at 2012Z time the Ki! Division responsible
for action disseminated this report to the Department of State, the FOI,
and the Navy Department by routine electrical transmission, adding sone

collateral details dravn fran a preliminary file review:

(1) 0n.1 October 1963 a relfable and sensitive
source in Mexico reported that an Anerican male,
who identified himself as Lee OSWALD, contacted
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring

whether the Embassy hag received any news con
cerning a telegrat which had been sent to
Washington. The Aterican was_described 38 |
approximately 35 years old; with an athtetié :
dui ld,. about 6 feet tall, with a "receding"

hairline. i

(2) It is believed that OSWALD may be identical
to Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD, born Gn 18 October 1939
in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine
who defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959
and later made arrangements through thé United
States Embassy in Moscow to return to the United
States with his Russiansborn wife, Narina

Nikolaeyna PUSAKOVA [sic] and their child.

(3) The information in paragraph. (1) is being
disseminated to your representatives in Mexico Citys:
Any further information received on this sudject
will be furnished you. This information is being
made available to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.

22, Although the reaction of the Headquarters desk was "by the

book" and in good time, there were a number of errors in this advisory

to the departments which, on the record, were concerned with the OSWALD
case:

8
SECRET



aa

SECRET

a, OSWALD’ middle name mas mrsgiven: "Henry" for Har

The reason for this mistake is simplicity itself. The sheet opening
the File on OSWALD on 9 Decerber 1960-had been erroneous ly inscrited
"CSWALD, Lee Henry.” That shect--unchanged except for the fotation of
the error--is still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

b. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: "PUSAKOVA" for PRUSAKOVA.

Neither of these. errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters communications throughcut.the-month). More important was: :

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's. report, which dealt’ with
a ‘concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual
observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to
Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,
“appeared to be an American," was transfornied in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The Anerican.” |

There can be no question that this misreading of the Mexico Station report
was an analyst's error which escaped detection in the coordination before
release: the descriptive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the
mark as to be immediately recognizable as such by the recipients in Head-
quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photos of OSWALD, (In partial
explanation, if not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that manent CIA

had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

23. Confirmation of this judgment is provided by the contents of
the cable composed by the same analyst and sent as of 2209Z' time (two

hours later) to Mexico Station, referencing its & October cable:

own initiative he appeared at the Embassy with

at that time had been to remain in USSR and for a
temporary extension of his tourist-visa pending

“priority pouch a plioto of OSWALD so, that Station
‘ean check all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forward
ing soonest copies of only visitor to Soviet Embassy
fon 1 October who could be identical with OSWALD.”

28. It_is clear that, Mexico Station had forgotten that according
to {ts ovn communication the unidentified ‘male in the photo was of
“apparent age 35" and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded
by Headquarters on 10 October precluded the identity with OSWALD of the

person whom they regarded as the “only visitor to the Soviet Embassy on

1 October who could be identical.”

29. The Station meanwhtle-had begun an exhaustive and accelerated
review of all its technical and photagraphic intelligence. A dispatch ,
was’ prepared in accordance with the indication given in the cable of
22 November, cited in paragraph 25 ebove. The dispatch noted that
photo coverage of the “unidentifiéd individual had turned up on 4 and
15 October at the Soviet and ‘Cuban Embassies, respectively. The text

of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch read:

“1, Attached are copies of the only photographs

Mexico, on that date... .

"P.S: Photographs dated 15 October 1963 were

taken as [the] person entered 'the Cuban Embassy."

Attached were eight photographs: four (of which two were marked

Seas would seem"to be logical that the word "sets" was probably anitted from :

paragraph two of the dispatch between the words "two" and “photographs.” ia

30. That the Station. was working under forced“draft is clearty : eee nouceet :

as a postscript. That fact was reported simultaneously by cable to

31. Headquarters, at 01362 time, 23 November 1963, asked Mexico

the néxt available flight.

Tae. Concurrent ly with or before the foregoing cables to Headquarters,
the Chief of Station, Mexico City, had spoken directly by-double-tatk
telephone with the Western Hemisphere Chief of Division, Mr. J. C. KING,
_and secured permission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden-

Chief.of. Station to the WH Division Chief, mailed to the latter from

34, The decision to remit the phutoaraphs to the FE! in Dalles
had been made by the Aubassador, according to the Chief of Station, who
simultaneously: with the FGI agent's departure reported to. Headquarters

\ by cable (02442 time, 23 November):

‘ “FBI agent left here 2000 tocal time with two copies

each of six photos of a person suspected to be

35. Headquarters responded two hours later, 04222 time,

23 November 1963, cancelling its request:

"1.:-No need send staffer with photos. We have
asked Navy for photos again, but Mexico: can see

OSWALD's picture soonest on the press wire.

"2. Have just re-emphasized to FBI Headquarters

the sensitivity of photos you are’ sending and also

relaying names ‘of travelers with similar names.

Note radio says OSWALO lived under alias of

QO. H. LEE.”

36. On the 23rd at 17297 time, Headquarters advised Mexico City:

eee "The FBI says that the photos of the man

entering the Soviet Embassy which Mexico

Station,sent to Dallas were not of Lee OSWAID.
- Prestine Mexico Station has double-checked
dates of these photos and is also checking all

a pertinent photos for.possible shots of OSWALD."

37. And at this. point, 20482 tine, 23 November, Mexico Station

finally agreed:

“Saw photos of Lee OSWALD on television night of

22 November and it obvious photos sent to Dallas

were not identical with Lee OSWALD Held fi’ DaTTas~

Dates are as given on photos.

"Mexico Station is reviewing al] available photos

of persons entering Soviet and Cuban Embassies.”

38. Two hours later (22542 time, 23 November 1963) the Station had

“reported the results of its effort to review al] available coverage:

“Compiete recheck of photos of a1] visitors to

atl Soviet Embassy photos fran 1 September.

Note, only visit we know he made to Cuban Embassy

28 September, Saturday, on which Embassy closed

and we had not’ had coverage . .-. ."

39. With this comunication the matter of the “unidentified
individual” reaches the end of Pliase I, the key element of which is the
conviction, at- first latent, then expressed, that the photographed
individual might be identical with OSWALD. This applies especially to
the Station, thaigh at a certain point even Headquarters moved no
rebuttal despite the-hard fact that the description of CSWALD. and the

unidentified individual were quite disparate.

40. - .This.review has attempted to.deal even-handedly with all iters
in the case record that have a bearing on what happened, The operational
zeal, fnnovativeness, and the high committment of all involved,
especially in Mexico City, speaks for itself. Equally apparent-~
because of the 20/20 advantage of hindsight--is the evidence of
non-performance. It was a critical failure, for example, that no photo
of OSWALD was made avai lable--though it was expressly requested both at

Headquarters and by the field--or that it was not more aggressively

obviated--in a way the mere possession of a correct physical description
evidently could not--the whole successive deterioration of what began in .
Mexico City as-dn iepressionistic selection of the’ photograph on

1 October 1983 into a cause celebre today.

40, It shadld te clear from this factual survey that never had

there been a
clear from the facts themselves that there was nothing contrived or
conspired ‘in what happened, unless we have now descended to that point
in-human values achieved under STALIN in the. USSR and under HITLER in i
Germany, where just a plain’mistake {s per se evidence of conspiracy.

41. Special Agent of the FBI, Bardwell D. ODUM, on 23 November
1963 showed one cf the six photos flown up fron Mexico City the previous
day to OSKALD's mother, Marguerite OSWALD. ODUM himself had trimmed off
the background by straight cuts. “Mrs. OSWALD had no recognition of the

image in the photograph. ODUM's own detailed account may be found in

Hearings, op cit. Vol. XX, p. 268.

42. The photograph shows the unidentified individual in a black

shirt. It was one of the five photos taken of him in front of the Soviet

«two days after OSWALD had

left the city.

43. At this point, for the record, the total available photo

coverage of the unidentified intividual rumbers twelve (12) photographs:

a+ Five (5) taken on 1 October 1963, entering and exiting the”
Soviet Embassy. “He is garbad in a white shirt and light-colored

(khaki - 2) trousers.

“b.. Five’ (5) taken cn 4 October 1963 in front of the Soviet

Embassy. - He is“garbéd in a dark. open, button-down shirt witli a

‘ a
high-neckline undershirt showing and dark trousers.

c. Two (2) taken on 15 October 1963 in front of the Cuban

Embassy. .He is wearing a dark, collarless T-shirt or light sweater.

The negatives of all of these are extent and are now held in Headquarters

as integral parts of. the OSWALD and related file holdings.

44, The result of ODUM's display of the photograph=-to repeat, a
cropped version’ of one of thase noted under paragraph 43b, above--was
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of
her son's killer, Jack RUBY, 2 day before he perpetuated the deed! Again
the Warren, Commission Report (pp. 364-365, 367) exhaustively disposes
of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-

ting fact developed atong the way was Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) observation,

the ODUM photograph‘becane Conrission Exhibit 237 (see Hearings,

Vol. XVI, p. 638).

45. The net effect of the developments in the hearings of the
Commisston was to require the admissior of the cropped photograph into
evidence in a chain of depositionsbeginning with ODUM, including the
FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph used by
the Commission ‘tn Washington), and Richard HELMS, -who deposed for the
originator, These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearirigs, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly
advised against the publication of the photograph in any form on the
grounds that the Soviets would be immediately alerted to the existence
of a useful and continuing U.S. intelligence ‘operation, and the opera-—
tion ‘would go down the drain, There were repeated cables exchanged on
this point between Headquarters and Mexico Station during the summer
of 1964, in particular fran 23 September’ ‘to 15 October 1964 when the

Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

Within a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. 1 and
Commission Exhibit 237, members of the, Soviet Embassy began systematic
efforts to survey the surrounding buildings, ostensibly for rental
space, but clearly their inquiries were directed to spotting possible
camera sites. The operation was continued in any case, Within a year
1t had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Auericans’ in ‘

on. 15.Novenber and 14 December, respectively, from

is now Executive Director of a Committee to Investigate Assassina-
tions, 927 55th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., beginning on
22.March 1971, shortly after the Agency declassified Commission

FBI's declassification of Conis:
1971, Hr. FENSTERWALD was invited to the Asency for a discussion

with the General Counsel, Nr. HOUSTON, of his question about the

photograph of the unknown individual. Two other photographs of
the unidentified individua}, in addition to the photograph

depicted inthe: two Commission exhibits, were shown to him’at that
time. It is a matter of more than ordinary interest to note that
on this occasion Mr: FENSTERWALO, who was accompanied by his
partner, Mr. Wiliam OHLHAUSEN, told Mr. HQUSTON and another
representative of the Agency..in attendance that he knew who_the
unidentified man was. The following is extracted fron ME. HQUSTON's

Memorandum of Record, 8 April 1971:

"3. Mr. FENSTERWALD came to my office this
morning with his partner, Ni}liam G. ONLHAUSEN,
looked at the other photographs, and told us he
did know who the man was. He said he is presently
serving a prison term somewhere in the United
States and admitted that he had known OSWALD, but
Mr. FENSTERWALD said there was nothing to indicate
any connection between the man in the photographs
and the assassination of President KENNEDY,

Mr, FENSTERWALD did not give us the man's name at :
this time, as he said enough people had suffered

The following is extracted from the Memorandum of Record

by the other CIA man present, Nr. Arthur E. DOOLEY.

"Mr, FENSTERWALD said he knew who the person

nervous to come forth dn his own, FENSTCRWALD eaeere
would fot give the man's name but said he isan

American, serving a prison term in this country

on a criminat charge, and that he had met OSWALD
{n Mexico. 1 asked whether the prisoner had any
conspiratorial relationship with OSWALD.
FENSTERWALD replied he did not know the answer

« Henry Knoche

mnt to the Director
‘tontral Intelligence Agency
ashington, D.C.

Deat Mr. Knoche:

As-you. hnow,, Led Harvey Oswald was in Mexico City in

Aate Septembse and.early October, 1963. Shortly after
s taken Of an American

male and a question wa: sed whéther or not this male was
Lee Harvey Oswald. ‘the CIA and the Warren Commission both
determined that the pictura was not of Lee. Harvey Oswald
and that the picture was taken after Oswald left Mexico

city.

Although portions of this record have boen released to the
public, other portions have remained classified because

of concerns by the CLA at tho time that a release of tha
full picture might disclose sources and methods which the
CIA felt were not in the national interest to disclose at

t tima. In light of the false allegations about the
ssassination of President Kennedy and the false allegations
ef CIA involvement, I feel that it ‘would be appropriate to
reconsider whether or not the entire matter can be fully

disclosed at this time.

X would Like to receive by April 22 a full report from
the CIA on this entird matter.

Sincecely yours,

Belin
