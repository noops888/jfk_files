1, INTRODUCTION, In Reference E, JNWAVE forwarded a review
of the nature’of its relationship with AMCARBON-2, This review
indicates that the relationship with AMCARBON-2 evolved from that
action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security
breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was
being carried out by the'Identity 1 relative to the fact that the
establishment|of the Identity 2 was being kept from the YOBELT
South Campus as a result of security restrictions which were in some
way related to JMDUSK, While the relationship with AMCARBON-2
stenmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis
situation, the establishment of a working relationship with the
Identity'3 was an.objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain.
As a matter of fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made
that JMWAVE be given approval to contact the major South Florida
news media injan attempt to work out a relationship with these news
media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity
spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might
come to their/attention, - Thus, when a relationship was established
with AMCARBON-2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE
might be able; to use this contact at the Ldentity 3 as a means of
achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3,
which would simultaneously insure the security of JMWAVE's operations
and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for
surfacing certain select propaganda items, In the period October to

tecember 1962,) all of JMWAVE's business with the Identity 3

vas handled via AMCARBON-2, In mid-December 1962, AMCARBON-2
iade the suggestion that he introduce REUTEMAN to AMCARBON-1

n order that there be a backup contact, in the event that
‘MCARBON-2 were out of town or unavailable at such times as
(EUTEMAN might| require assistance from the Identity 3, REUTEMAN
igreed to ANCARBON-2's suggestion, and, as a result, AMCARBON-2
iosted a luncheon on 12 December 1962 at the Miami Club in the
fotel Columbus, Miami, Florida, at which ANCARBON-2 introduced
\MCARBON-1 to REUTEMAN, As a result of this initial meeting on
[2 December 1962,.an operational relationship has developed with
\NCARBON-1, and it is believed that this relationship contributes
to the fulfillment of the over-all JMWAVE mission, In view of
this, a special activities report is being submitted to cover the
jature of JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARNON-1 during the

period December 196% to March 1964.

2, FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR JMWAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ANCARBON=1

When AMCARBON=2 Intioduced ANCARBON-I to RMUTEMAN, ANCARBON-2 a
reviewed the ground rules under which he had been cooperating

with REUTEMAN, This review was conducted Zor AMCARBON-1's }
benefit, in order that he might clearly understand the frame of :
veferenge which should prevail in his relavionships with REUTEMAN,
In this review, AMCARBON-2 pointed out thac it was the policy

of the Identity 3 that it would take no action which would ~
purposely, embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations, As

i result, if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations
fn South’Florida did come to the attention of the Identity 3, this
material would be brought to REUTEMAN's imnediate attention.
AMCARBON-2 made it clear to AMCARBON-1 that such items should be
discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner, In addition, AMCARBON-2
made the point that, after an item was discussed, AMCARBON-1

should follow REUTENAN's guidance relative to how any particularly
cnbarrassing item might be handled by the {dentity 3, so that it
sould not expose KUBARK operations and, at-the same time, would

not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3. :
In addition, AMCARBON-2 pointed out that, if AMCARBON-1 brought

a potentially embarxassing item to REUTEMAN's attention and
remedial action on the matter was not takea by REUTEMAN withia
a reasonable period of time, then the Identity 3 would feel free
fo expose any ineptness on KUBARK's part. AMCARBON-2 pointed
but that in return for this cooperation from the Identity 3,
REUYEMAN had agreed that he would be available for contact by
telephone or periddic personal meetings at which AMCARBON-1

and ANCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in
Latin American affairs, AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON~1 that this i
arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect te obtain
any classified infocmation from REUTEMAN, The point was a1so
aye that ANCARBON-L should not press for the obtaining of
wassified information, but he should be alert to steering tips
hich REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories.
AMCARBON-1 indicated that he understood the frame of reference
which had been Outlined by AMCARBON-2, This frame of reference
has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON- 1
during the period December 1962 to March 1964.

3, AMCARBON-1'S JOURNALISTIC CAREER, ANCARBON~1 originally
started to work for the Ydentity 3 in 1957 on the City Desk,
and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment
hich entailed covering major political developments in Florida, 5
At a later date, AMCARBON-1 became a feature writer tor the
Tdentity 3. Thon in July or August 1062, AMCARBON-1 was made

promotion for AMCARBON-1, and it reflected confidence in him by
the Identity 3 management, AMCARBON-1 is by no means an expert

on Latin Amevica, but he is developing his knowledge on the area
and, at the noment, he gives every indication of wanting to be a
long-term Lavin American specialist, QDELF has been questioned
about AMCARBON-1, and he has indicated that AMCARBON-1 is regarded
in the journalistic trade as an extcemely likeable fellow who has
a keen mind hut who lacks experience in depth on Latin American
affairs, It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse

of time, AMCARBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin
American specialists in U.S, journalistic circles, AMCARBON-1

has a working command of Spanish, and he is constantly attempting
to improve his language fluency, It is REUTEMAN's opinion that
ANCARBON-1 has developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist,
and he will continue to grow in this field, Thus, he is a contact
who should be developed and harnessed for exploitation, bearing
in mind that he does have long-term potential,

4, AMCARBON-1'S CONTACTS AND SOURCES, In keeping’ with the
traditional pattern oF Source protection which is common to
iuispapernen, intelligence officers and law enforcement officers,
ANCARBON-1 attempts to guard the true identity of all of his
aetrees. On the other hand, when pressed, AMCARBON-1 has identified
Sources*nis sources to REUTEMAN, in order’ that meaningful evaluations
somtd be mado of that information which AMCARBON-1 had passed to
KUBARK, As a result of these occasional witting identifications
of his ‘sourcos, and, as a result of general conversations with
QNCARBON.1, REQTEMAN has learned that ANCARBON-1's sources include
the following person

a, Luis’ *FERNANDEZ Rocha (201-316766), secretary general
of the DRE, 7

.thinking about exposing the role of Miami attorney Alex 2, Boanisow
residing 145 Curtiss Parkway, Miami Springs, Florida, in the i
Bay of Pigs operation, AMCARBON-1 stated that, if CARLSON were
of any current interest to REUTEMAN, then the Identity 3 would
soft peddle the CARLSON angle, REUTEMAN advised AMCARBON-1 that
he had no interest in CARLSON but knew of him and was of the
opinion | that CARLSON was a sound and honest attorney, The receipt
of this |operational intelligence enabled JMWAVE to brief CARLSON
on the Identity 3's over-all interest in the role that. CARLSON had
played in the Bay of Pigs invasion, This briefing, in turn,
enabled [CARLSON to more adequately prepare himself for a meeting
with AMGARBON-1.. While AMCARBON-1 did attempt to pursue this
Bay of Bigs story, he never did put anything into print as the story
was overtaken by other developments before AMCARBON-1 could finish
hig reseaych, 7

,

7" 5. Im WAVESagp4, dated 9 July 1963, AMCARBON-1 advised ’
SMWAVE that Mr, Trevor WARMBRISTER, an associate editor for the
Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting
to research a story regarding the possibility that strategic
missileg were hidden in Cuban caves, This information enabled
JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles
which might be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba,

: d., In WAVE 4701, dated 20 September 1963, AMCARBON-1
gave JMWAVE his -resume of the discussions which he had with
AMBIDDY-1 at the Miami Playboy Club on 19 September 1963, This
information was useful in obtaining an insight into what AMBIDDY-1
was telling the press.

e. In WAVE 5661, dated 10 October 1963, AMCARBON-1
reported on a discussion that he had had on 10 October 1963 with
AMBIDDY-1's public relations man, This operational intelligence
was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-1's
representatives-were telling the outside world about their
operational activities, 5

£, In WAVE 6910, dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON-1

informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were
being received at the Identity 3 relative to so-called KUBARK
vessels which were located in South Florida waters, This
information alerted JMWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny was
going to be directed toward the Identity 5, Armed with this warn-
ing, JUWAVE was able to take action which minimized the publicity
repercussions from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5,

g. In WAVE7671, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1
reported to JUWAVE the fact that he had received a letter from
Peru which contained an interesting operational lead to one
Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Peru. This lead was examined by JMWAVE,
Headquarters and the Lima Station, This examination revealed
that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no |
real operatioaal potential in this lead, This incident did underse
the fact that AMCARBON-1 is willing to bring potentially significan
operational leads to JMWAVE's attention,

he In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCARBON-1
advised JMWAVE that he had received numerous telephone calls
indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had aefected
Peer cis eat SORT re a previously
iion seen in Miami during November or December 1963, At the same
time, AMCARBON-1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought
that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was rot a bona
fiae defector, but was either a GOC agent or a KUBARK plant, who
ase peing used as a means of creating an incident which would
embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishing boats penetrating

\
United States territorial waters, REUTEMAN advised AMCARBON-1
that /KUBARX had played no role in mounting a provocation operation
against the GOC, At the same time, REUTEMAN pointed out that
it was highly unlikely that GUIROLA was a GOC agent, As a result
of this conversation, arrangements were made for JMWAVE to check
out certain aspects of the GUIROLA story, At the same time,
AMCARBON-1 was prevailed upon not to write a story which might
lead the public to speculate on waether GUIROLA was an agent or a
plant in a propaganda play designed to embarrass the GOC,

'7. PROPAGANDA OUTLET, AMCARBON-1 has been used successfully
during the period covered by this report, as a propaganda outlet
through which items of interest to KUBARK could be surfaced in
the free world press, Examples of how AMCARBON-1 has been harnessed
in this ficld are outlined below:

| a, AMCRAB-1, The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally
surfaced ir the Miami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de
las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo,
‘The API Montevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-1's information
relative tc GOC activities in Uruguay, The story in the Diario
de las Americas had an extremely iimited impact on Spanish readers
in the Miami area, As a result, i:t was decided to do a series
of feature stories on AMCRAB-1, pointing up the fact that AMCRAB-1
was typical of the veterans of the Granma expedition, who felt
they had been betrayed by CASTRO end had been relegated to positions
of obscurity once the revolution had put CASTRO in power, AMCARBON-
was briefed in detail on the AMCR‘B-1 story, and he was given an
opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 urder controlled conditions in a
SMWAVE safehouse, After completirg his debriefing, ANCARBON-1
wrote a series of feature articles on ANCRAB-1, The first article
in the series received front page headline play. The series of
articles on AMCRAB-1 were well written, and they- provided an
excellent peg for JMWAVE to mount -a replay operation via other
propaganda assets, AMCARBON-1's story on AMCRAB-1 was picked up
by UPI, API and others, and it was played throughout Latin America
The details of this surfacing’ can be found in WAVE 5&26, dated
14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174,
dated 21 October 1963,

b, Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat Story, On 26 February 1964
JMWAVE learned that when Wr, Charles GRIFFIN’s sons went to Cuba
to reclaim the hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY REB, they found that
select items were missing from the boat when it was turned over
to them, It was believed that this information would make a good
human interest story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC
propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items
from the Cuvan fishing boats which had violated United States
territorial waters, In view of this opinion, a steering tip was
given to AMCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in
Key West interview Mr, GRIFFIN, This interview was carried out,
and an article outlining the points which were of interest to
JNWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the
Identity 3.

c. LAYC Story, The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santiago,
Chile, was not receiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida
newspapers; as a result, REUTENAN contacted AMCARBON-1 on 5 March
1964 and sugested that’ the LAYC meeting was a story which’ the
Identity 3 should pursue, AMCARBON-1 was grateful for this steering
tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC
to éne of the members of his staff, A story on the LAYC was |
Subsequently published in the 6 Macch 1964 edition of the Identity q

8,| POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE, Attempts have been made to
obtain disseminable positive intelligence from AMCARBON-1 during
the period covered by this report, This attempt has been generally
unsuccessful, in that AMCARBON-1 does not have a great number of
contacts in Latin America who would give him access to worthwhile
intelligence appreciably in advance of the information appearing
in the overt press, As a result, AMCARBON-1 is usually not aware of jin:
inside developments in any Latin American country; consequently,
he is not a worthwhile source of positive intelligence, As a
matter of fact, AMCARBON-1 is less valuable as a source of positive
intelligence than most journalists, This is attributable solely
to his lack of long-standing contacts in the Latin American politica
scene, |It is believed that AMCARBON-1 will ultimately overcome
this shortcoming; thus, we will continue to attempt to harness him fdr
the collection of positive intelligence,

9, COMMENT, In the period covered by this report, ANCARBON-1
has been Found €6 be a straight-forward individual who is honest
cooperative and who understands the need for security, Our
relationship also indicates that AMCARBON-l is an accurate reporter
of that/information which he passes to KUBARK, In view of this,
JMWAVE plans to continue to harness AMCARBON-1 in the same manner
that he'has been used in the past, It is believed that our rela—
tionship with AMCARBON-1 enhances our ability to conduct our
operational mission in a secure manner, In addition, ‘this relation—
ship tends to minimize the possibility that JMWAVE might have diffi-
culties with the media outlets in the South Florida area, As a
result of our continuing relationship with AMCARBON-1, a special

activities report will be forwarded at appropriate intervals,
|
10,' It is requested that a 201 number be ussigned AMCARBON-1
and that JMWAVE be advised of the number.
