“Ti. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

f21\ In his Executive Session testimony before the Select
Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for
Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the
investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
follows:
f Lvy This crime was committed on United
States soil. Therefore, as far as the
Federal government was concerned, the pri-
mary investigating agency would have been
the Federal Bureau of Investigation without
any question. The role of the CIA would
have been entirely supportive in the sense
of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

*The following exchange between Mr. Rocca and Committee
Counsel sheds, further light on the difficuities—encountered
by-—the~agency,” ‘related—to—tts investigation of possible
Cuban involvement in the assassination:

Mr. Goldsmith. Earlier, when I asked you which
areas of the case received emphasis, I believe that you
indicated that on balance the primary area of emphasis
was the Soviet connection.

Mr. Rocca. That was certainly the one that I would
say dominated -- looking at it from my point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-
Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA, would
you have given more priority, more emphasis, to the
possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Mr. Rocca. Again, I say that it would have
simply intensified it, that there was attention given
to it, not particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities
on the Cuban side.

The organization of their service and their
operation in Mexico was something entirely entirely (sic)
within -- it was an-enigma at the time. They were just
getting started. This was area. This was #ttt CAne ey
Geettbs area of proficiency.) So the defectors had only z
begun to come out and they/€ame out later, the Cuban
defectors. Sarasin aaa pet PS

‘cl Ase» AS

So, I can't -- I really @ Gait say~th a) the
Cuban connection was ignored, because it wasn't. The
press was filled with it at the time.

The Harker interview should have been undoubtedly
given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it
was given specific attention, I was told at the time of
the Rockefeller thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. In what way was the Cuban connection
investigated?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know. I don't know this.
That side of the report strikes me as being inadequate.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, when I said to what extent
was the Cuban connection investigated, I don't mean by
the Warren Commission. I mean to what extent did the
Agency provide --

Mr. Rocca. That I can't answer. I certainly
didn't do it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Pardon me?

Mr. Rocca. We certainly didn't, in R & A.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, CI/R & A did not --

Mr. Rocca. Go into the Cuban side of it at all.
This was something left to the people who were concerned
specifically with Cuban intelligence and security operation.

Mx. Goldsmith. But I believe earlier we
established that Mr. Helms gave orders that information
pertinent to the assassination was to go through your
office, correct?

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

“Mr. Goldsmith. And once information pertinent
to the assassination went through your office, I take (it)
you or Mr. Helms would decide what information would
be relevant for the Warren Commission to see.

Is that correct?

Mr. Rocca. Well --

Mr. Goldsmith. Based upon what you knew?

Mr. Rocca. Well, everything would go, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Therefore, you were in the
position, it would seem, to know what information was
being generated in the field that was going to the
Warren Commission.

Earlier I asked you which area received emphasis
and I believe you indicated that the Soviet area (did).

in light of that, the Committee
would like to be informed as to
why the Warren Commission was:

Mr. Helms: I have never been asked to testify
before the Warren Commission about
our operations.

Mr. Goldsmith: If the Warren Commission did not
know of the operation, it certainly
was not in a position to ask you
about it.

Is that not true?

Helms: Yes, but how do you know they did
not know about it? How do you
know Mr. Dulles had not told them?
How was I to know that? And besides,
I was not the Director of the Agency
and in the CIA, you did not go
traipsing around to the Warren Com-
mission or to Congressional Committees
or to anyplace else without the

L Director.'s permission.

Mr. Helms further indicated that the CIA might
be called upon to provide additional information
acquired from checks of CIA records and agency
sources. He suggested that certain policies be
employed to enable CIA to work cooperatively
with the Commission in a manner which would
protect CIA information, sources and methods.
Among the policies articulated were two which
Helms claimed would enable the Agency to control
the flow of Agency originated information. In
this way the CIA could check the possibility of
revealing its sources and methods inadvertantly.

Standing by - by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic

have merited serious attention in the months following
the assassination.

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments
could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible
foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,
Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

the Agency's Cuban and Soviet telephone
intercepts that might suggest foreknowledge
of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

(the first person: of the verb enterarsefie,

past tense) should be translated as I found
out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination7
almost before Kennedy /did7. “In other words,
Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.l).

“Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."
The verb entere is mistranslated. Me supers

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's. comments
assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's
position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's
comments as a suggestion on her part of possible
foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

Langosch paraphrased fe
as follows: : §

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned
about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made
a trip to Mexico, that she had been
involved with an American in Mexico. The
information to which I refer was told to
me by a DGI case officer... I had commented
to (him) that it seemed strange that Luisa
Calderon was receiving a salary from the
DGI although she apparently did not do
any work for the Service. (The case’ officer)
told me that hers was’ a peculiar case and
that he himself believed that she had been
recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence
Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head
of the DGI, did not agree. As I recall,
(the case officer) had investigated Luisa
Calderon. This was because, during the time
she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted
a letter to her by an American who signed
his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation
of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in
Spanish so I am not sure of how the name

AL “mentioned by Hernandez! should be spelled.
It could have been “Howard” or something
different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love
letter but indicated that there was a
clandestine professional relationship
between the writer and Luisa Calderon.
I also understand from (the case officer)
that after the interception of the letter
she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American. I do OW
this could have been Oswald.. < a / 51

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-L's defection
and considered the possibility that he
might have some knowledge of the Oswald
case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions
to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing
AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that
AMMUG-1 was debriefed on 4 May 64 regarding
this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing:
on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive
matter, it was dictated directly to a CI
(Counterintelligence) stenographer on

5 May 1964. /Note: A-1 was debriefed on
several subjects on 4 May 64. ‘The procedure
was to assign each subject discussed a
debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case
officer. The instructions from CI staff
were to handle the Oswald case debriefing
very closely and not to keep any copies in
WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing
report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly
to a CI staff stenographer. There would

be no reason to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for
CI staff, since it was their only debriefing
report. We are certain it is the debriefing
report (#40) because’ the date is the’ same;
it is the only debriefing report on Oswald
listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)
the. only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in
Oswald's an file.

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH
operation as an “assassiamtion operation"; the
case officer did not; I,~as Executive Officer, never ?
discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other

branch chiefs and the special assistants could not
have so characterized it since they did not know
about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a
hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH
for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.) |
The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day
of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the
pen with disdain. /Tbid., par. 4, p. 2/), (Ibid.,
par. 6, p. 3)

assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death. The broader and more significant issue,
as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether
the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy
to have been reported to the Warren Cominission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this
determination is a most difficult matter to
resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their
characterization of the Agency's operational
objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence
it is the Committee's position that such informa-
tion, if made available to the warren Commission,
might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-
tive concern for possible Cuban involvement or
complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin
commented before this Committee:

++-when I read..sthe Church Committee's

report~-it was an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met

and then either blame the rest of it

on somebody else or not tell any more
or polish it off. I don't think that
