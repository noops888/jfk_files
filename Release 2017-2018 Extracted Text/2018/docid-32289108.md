On May 25, 1967, Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Director

of the DES,

and Rafael Hernandez Ochos, Under Secretary of

Goverment (Interior), advised that no decision has been

reached as the matter

is very sensitive politically.

There

is a feeling that the DES should not be compromised

in this

matter even though they are anxious to see the subjects

prosécuted.

While it might be possible for Mexican Army

this also poses political

problems which require further thought.

Our representative noted that
