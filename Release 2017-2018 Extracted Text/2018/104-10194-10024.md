bursement for 75% of the excess allowable costs up to,
but not in excess of, 60% of the standardized quarters

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Thomas H. Karamessines

SUBJECT 2 Housing

1. The following 1s a listing of the GS-13 and above
staff employees and their quarters costs as of April 1965: _

Grade & No. of Cost to
Dependents Allowance Cost Individual
(COS)GS-16 (3) $2,900 $4,236 All cost paid
GS-15 (1) 2,900 3,132 $116
GS-15 (0) 2,000 1,800 0

GS-13 (3) 2,000 2,472 236
GS-13 (5) 2,000 2,544 272

“_ 2, Mr, Hunt's quarters allowance is $2,900. Using
the same-formula as applied to the other staff employces
at the Station, the following would be the figures:

$2,900 + 60% ($1,740) = $4,640

On a 50/50 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he

would be out-of-pocket $870 if his costs were $4,640.

On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he
would be out-of-pocket $135, if his costs were $4,640

3. I would recommend he be authorized the 75/25 per-
cent sharing basis of the allowable excess costs up to, °
but not to exceed, 50 percent above his quarters allowance.
