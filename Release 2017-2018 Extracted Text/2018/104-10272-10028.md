Bolten reported difficulties encountered yesterday
when SSC Counsel Fritz Schwartz objected to an OGC staffer
reading a portion of the SSC's final report. He asked to
be advised of any further problems in this regard.

In response to a note received from the DCI yesterday,
Bolten assured that the Agency would not make any substantive
comments on the SSC's final report. The Director said we
must be careful not to leave the impression that the Agency
is endorsing the report.

Thuermer noted that Time magazine editors have offered
the Director an opportunity to comment on the SSC report.
The Director asked Thuermer to decline this offer. Thuermer
also advised that Strobe Talbott has withdrawn his request
to see the Director.

Bolten reported that he will meet with a member of the
House Ethics Committee team investigating the leak of the
HSC report and that the investigator may also wish to talk
with CIA officers who had access to the report.

Bolten suggested that we maintain a good record of
foreign and public reactions to the SSC report for possible
use with our oversight committees to illustrate damage
resulting from publicity of the report. Bolten stated his
belief that the Agency has been hurt most by allegations
of CIA involvement in Watergate and President Kennedy's
assassination. In this connection, he said a study on
the Warren Commission will be published by the SSC next
month; the theme they are developing is that, because of
CIA plots against Castro, the latter retaliated and was
connected with President Kennedy's assassination. Bolten
suggested it might be worthwhile to talk with Senators
Schweicker and Gary Hart, the principals behind the study,
as this could prove more damaging domestically than the
SSC report. In response to the Director's query, Bolten
said that the SSC thoroughly investigated-allegations of
CIA involvement in the JFK assassination but could find no
indications of such involvement. Chamberlain added that,
although investigations could not prove that Castro knew
about CIA plots against him and took retaliatory action
against JFK, they did not disprove this either.

Calling attention to yesterday's Washington Post
article on AMLASH, Bolten said this is the first time
Cubela's name and the full extent of his activities have
appeared in print. He said this stems from the SSC's report
on assassinations, which gave the journalist, George Crile,
enough information to permit him to piece the story together.

The Directer noted continuing inquiries with regard to our alleged
involvement in the Kennedy assagsination. Chamberlain noted that this
matter had been thoroughly reviewed by his office, and the only thing we
were remiss on was perhaps Dulles' not advising the Commission of plots
against Castro, which some theoreticians now feel could have precipitated
Oswald's action.”

i.e., whether to issue a report and, if so, what kind. He
repeated his opinion that issuance of this report could be

Bolten reported that Senator Church's SSC will issue its final report,
on CJA and FBI cooperation with the Warren Commission, on 23 June.
Based on circumstantial evidence, the repoft comes close to charging the
FBI and CIA with a cover-up or deliberate failure to provide information
to the Warren Commission. It also recommends that the matter be pur-
sued by Chairman Inouye's SSC; Bolten said it is his understanding that
Inouye will await public and press reaction to the report before deciding
whether to investigate further. The Director asked that background in-
formation on this report and on recent allegations by a Chilean intelli-
gence officer (see Morning Meeting Minutes of 10 June 1976) be provided
to Falkiewicz for handling of press inquiries. Bolten suggested that, if
press queries on the SSC report become intense, Falkiewicz be prepared
to say more than "no comment"; e.g., a statement that the judgments of
the report are highly speculative and based on circumstantial evidence.

that its Director, the late J. Ed-

The Director asked if we are aware of Chairman Inouye's
position on further investigating President Kennedy's assas-
sination, as recommended by the Church Committee report.
Bolten advised that, prior to issuance of the Church Committee
report, Inouye told the press that he would wait six months
and then make a decision. Bolten added that it appears
Inouye wishes to see how much pressure builds up to continue
the investigation. The Director asked if there are papers
pertaining to the Kennedy assassination which are locked up
until some later date. Knoche replied that the post-mortem
examination of the President involved photographs and other
items which have been sealed up at the request of the Kennedy
family. The Director asked if the Church Subcommittee that
investigated the assassination ever requested anything which
the Agency was unwilling to give them. Bolten replied nega-
tively and said that Senator Schweiker has acknowledged that
the Agency gave him everything they asked for. Bolten added
that there is always a possibility that a document related
to a request could turn up because it was filed in a way
that it could not be found. Knoche added that, although we
believe we cooperated as fully as possible, Bolten is taking
another look to make doubly sure that this is correct.

that I would like to see an FBI study if there were, as Inouye
had indicated, a lot of suggestions around that CIA might have
killed Roselli. I expressed my indignation at the thesis but
said the Agency would want to see a full FBI investigation.
Kelley indicated that the Attorney General decided the FBI should
not investigate this matter. It was agreed that Inouye, Kelley
and I would all talk to Attorney General Levi about this.

2. Playboy Story on CIA/Hughes, etc.
Inouye would welcome an investigation by his Committee

Baker Asks Data on Roselli Death

Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn., says he will ask
the FBI and the CIA to provide any information it
has on the murder of John Roselli, an underworld
strongarm man and gambler who testified he
made several CIA-sanctioned attempts to assassi-
nate Fidel Castro.

Baker, a member of the new Senate Intelligence
Committee, sald yesterday that he would talk with
the committee's chairman, Sen. Daniel Inouye,
about whether the panel should investigate links
between the slaying of Roselli that of Sam Gianca-
na, who was slain in his Chicago home in June
1975, “Both agreed to testify on the same subject,”"
Baker said. “Both were involved in the same
assassination operation.”

Justice Silent on Mercenary Probe

‘The State Department has turned information
on recruitment of U.S. mercenaries to fight in
Africa over to the Justice Department for possible
prosecution, Asst. Secretary of State
Schaulele Jr..told the House International
tions investigations subcommittee.

But Depuly Asst. Atty. Gen. Robert L. Keuch re-
fused yesterday to give details on an FBI investi-.
gation into allegations of recruitment of 25 to 39
Americans Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said
Justice has been investigating for a year without
results. :

Sthaufele said that “we attempted to discourage |
Americans [rom going to Angola as mercenaries.” {

wanted the two mobsters te come and tell them some-

yet, the part you're really not going to believe. It is
that when the great nativnal political community of

said: "Oh, my pocilness. Some of them went farther,

to be put forward in stark outline for their mauni-

wisdom goes, “paranoid” on our part to brood about
the suggestive and possibly monstrous intercennec-
tions between all these facts and to wonder why they
are not the object of intense press and government
scrutiny? What accounts for the general indifference

which we all seem to accept that Gamiliar tipoff that

Lapham related that Dade County investigators will be in Washington
and have asked us to run name traces on four Cubans thought to be connected
with John Roselli, as well as for the identity of other Cubans who may have
been involved or privy to Gastro assassination attempts. The Director
commented that it is to our advantage to cooperate in every way with the
investigators, and in response to the DDCI's query, Lapham explained
that the FBI has opted out of the investigation. Lapham went on to report
that SSCI staffer Madigan's session with Michael Merhige did not go parti-

a :

Waller provided the Director a copy of the 28 November 1963 CIA
cable referred to in Jack Anderson's 7 September 1976 article (attached)
and noted that efforts are under way to determine what action was taken
upon receipt of the cable and whether it was provided to the Warren
Commission. In response to the Director's query as to whether the cable
was provided to the SSC Subcommittee (chaired by Senator Sweicker) that
investigated CIA and FBI cooperation with the Warren Commission, Bolten
said that the Subcommittee had access to all Agency material pertaining
to the Kennedy assassination, including the file containing the cable.
The Director asked that we ascertain whether the cable was given to SSC
staffer Madigan or Liebengood and, if so, when. In response to Waller's
statement that the cable was among 1200 documents CIA released under
FOIA to attorney Melvin Belli, Blake said he would determine the date
it was provided.

Millen noted Bill Miller's advice that the SSCI voted unanimously to
proceed with their investigation of Roselli's assassination, and stated
that OLC might ask that the Director encourage Chairman Inouye to act on
our CIARDS amendments.

In response to Bolten's advice that the House Rules Committee voted
to establish a new conmittee to investigate the assassinations of President
Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Waller stated that,a task force headed by
the IG is already reviewing all material in the Agency's possession pertaining
to the Kennedy assassination.

The ruggediy handsome Roselli, a

that didn’t endear Castre tu him.

After Trafticante made it hack to his
Florida haunts, he left part of his or-
ganization behind in Havana. Some of
his henchmen even managed to de-

These were the people Roselli wanted

But Roselli didn't have the stature

arrangements with Trafficante. So
Roselli called in his patron, the Chi-

to deal with Trafficante.

down to Florida to make the prelimi-

_ Oswald Memo

Anspetated Press

A ,_ The chairman of a House committee
Investigating assassinations said yes-
terday he will subpoena an FBI memo
Indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald
told Cuban officials he planned to kill
President Kennedy,

Rep. homas N. Downing (D-Va.)
sald he is aware of the memo only
through news reports. The Washing-
ton Post reported Saturday that the
1064 memo had been discovered re-
cently by the Justice Department.

But he said “I feel sure it was" a

request from his cominittee, estab-
lished to probe the assassinations of
Kennedy and civil rights leader Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. that led to
discovery of the memo,
' His comment, made al a meeting of
the panel, appeared to conflict with
statements made to the Associated’
Press by an informed source who said
the memo had been provided to a St
ate Intelligence subcommiltee earlier
this year.

The source said the memo was writ-

ten In 1964 by FBI Director J. Fdear
Hoover, who quoted a bureau Infor-
mant as saying Oswald told Cuban of-
ficlals he planned to kill Kennedy. Ac-
cording to the source, the informant
said his Information came directly
from Cuban Premler Fidel Castro.
« The Informant said the information
was based on a report Castro had re-
ceived from officials of the Cuban em-
bassy In Mexico City, the source sald.
Oswatd visited the embassy on Sept.
27, 1963, about two months before
Kennedy's assassination in Dallas.

The source said he had read the
memo, but discounted its significance
since Castro had made a similar slate-
ment publicly In Auzust, 1967, In an
Interview with a British Journalist.

In Its second official meeting, the
committee held a brief public session
and confirmed Richard A. Spracuc, a
former xovernment presecutor, as
chief counsel. Sprague said he intends
to hire 169 to 179 investiaators,

The panel’ also agreed to form two
subcommittees to probe the Kennedy
and King stlayines simultanequsty.

statements which seem to imply that Belin believes documents have been
destroyed and that there was a cover-up by CIA and FBI. Stating that
he believed Bolten misinterpreted Belin's comments, the DDCI added
that Belin has always held the view that the passage of time would
make it too difficult to assemble the facts. At the Director's
request, the DDCI will call Belin to learn first-hand what he
told press representatives. The Director asked if we know the
accuracy of press allegations that FBI files contain a 1964 memo
written by FBI Director Hoover which indicates that Lee Harvey
Oswald told Cuban officials he planned to kill President Kennedy.
After a brief discussion, the Director asked that Lapham ask the
Justice Department if such a memorandum exists.

David Belin, a Des Moines attorney
who served on the staff of the Warren

Agency, said the House Select Com-
mittee on Assassinations, which met
for the first lime Monday, faces insur-
mountable problems in reopening the
investigation of the Kennedy assassl-
nation.

Intelligence sources have warned
that the committee may find certain
documents missing from the CIA or
FBI files and have suggested that the
probe be broadened to include a possi-
ble cover-up by the two agencies and
by U.S. intelligence officers in the
years following the November, 1963,

its work when it expires with the end

is expected to be sneedily reconstl

revelations about efforts by the CIA

elect Carter. Wells chaired the meeting.

Mulholland reported that the Cuban weekly Bohemia yesterday
carried a story that the Agency was involved in 21 plots to kill Castro.
He stated that the story was probably to counter U.S. press reports that
Castro was involved in President Kennedy's assassination and also might
be in preparation for Castro's planned series of press conferences, which
are now scheduled to be held sometime in December.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Morning Meeting of 26 November 1976

x

Waller critiqued the item in today's Washington Post by Ronald Kessler,

‘ "CIA Withheld Details on Oswald Call," related that David Phillips advised

this morning that statements attributed to him are misleading, and closed

by noting that the one fact we allegedly withheld concerned only Oswald's

request for a {ree trip to the Sovict Union. A brief discussion followed on

the possible source of Kessler's material, and later in the meeting, the

undersigned recalled that a few years ago the IG and LA Division were con-

cerned over a manuscript done by deceased former COS/Mexico Win Scott

and then in the hands of his widow. The DDCI noted that we will examine

our records on this.

Cary noted his understanding that the visit here by Richard Sprague
of the House Select Gommittee on Assassinations went well.
