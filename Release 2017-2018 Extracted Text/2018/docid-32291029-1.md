"This matter will be followed by the

As to his meeting with MARCELLO and DONOHUE in Washington,

and he described the approach to the entrance as walking across.

the sidewalk and up a flight of outside stairs to thelobby.

No past contacts between FRANK BALISTRIERI and CARLOS MARCELLO

are known to Milwaukee

he said that he did not know how they originally knew each

other, nor what the full extent of their relationship is,

except that they are both the Italian hoodlum type and probably

associate, in this respect.

With regard to more specific information as to times, dates and

places and identities of DONOHUE and DUFFY, the following in-

formation is fürnished:

By checking his telephone bills, RUSSELL was able to advise that

on January 19, 1961 he had called MARCELLO at Shreveport, La.,

phone 4101 and it was during this conversation that BALISTRIERI

verified to MARCELLO the fact that-RUSSELL was "OK to do business

with." It is noted that other New Orleans telephone numbers

called during this period

as reflected by RUSSELL's telephone

bill were as follows:

January 6, 1961

New Orleans FO 6-3466

January 10, 1961 New Orleans VE 5÷1701

With regard to his contacts with SAM MARCELLO by telephone in

March of 1962 as pointed out above,

the exact dates and numbers

called will be verified from the telephone bills after April

10, 19620

RUSSELL did

state, however, that he called MARCELLO

on March 16, and reached him at Jefferson Music Company, Gretna,

Louisiana but that they had no conversation beyond RUSSELL

telling MARCELLO to call him from a public phone to a specific

public phone in the Plankinton Arcade where RUSSELL'S office is

located in Milwaukee at 3 PV on that same date. MARCELLO did

call him back, and although RUSSELL is unable to furnish the

exact phone number that he called, it was one of the following

numbers which were observed to be on the public booths in the

Plankinton Arcade:

When MARCELLO did call him back on one of the above phones,

MARCELLO told him that everything was taken care of and not

to "spend a buck" in trying to do anything for CARLOS.

The DONOrUs reterred to is JAMES JOSEPHDONOU DONCHU Kn

Wisconsin (?) May 17, 1922, father JAMES JOSEPH

8310 North Port Washington Road, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

DONOHUE attended Marquette High

School for two years and

according to Credit Bureau records was in the Navy for five

years, having previously discontinued high school in his

last year for the purpose of entering the Navy. RUSSELL

said that he, DONOHUE, can be located almost any time through

the office of Senator CHAVEL, that he spends most of his time

In the Senate Office Building. He is also a member of the

Gaslight Key Club, where he spends a great deal of his time:

It is noted that RUSSELl was a little reluctant as to furnishing

thé exact address of DONOHUE (if he knows it) and this point

was not pressed, and the above information was obtained during

the course

of general conversation.

With regard to LAVERN DUFFY, RUSSELL did not know whether he

was the same one who had been on the McClellan Committee but

has heard him described as "BOBBY KENNEDY's right hand" and

believed

therefore that he was a special assistant in the

Department of Justice. RUSSELL did say that he was very

close to Attorney General

KENNEDY and, in fact, had taken

care of his children on occasions when

KENNEDY

was abroad.

With reference to Page 2, third paragraph of Milwaukee letter

dated March 24, 1962, RUSSELL advised that the Guatamalan

officials whose names he furnished to CARLOS MARCELLO through

his brother SAM, which apparently enabled CARLOS to speedily

return to the United States, RUSSELL now advises that they

were as follows:

GUILLERMO FLORES AVENDANO, who at that time

was Guatamalan Ambassador to Rome and is now

believed by RUSSELL to be Guatamalan repre-

sentative to the United Nations.

Second was GEORGE RUIZ, at that time a colonel

in the Guatamalan Air Force and president of

Avernica Airlines.

CAUTION:

In view of potential danger to PCI RUSSELL

if it were known

he had furnished information to the government

and in view of the possibility, if his story

is correct in fact, of 'misconduct in high

Department of Justice and/or INS circles,

extreme care must be taken in the investi-

gation of this matter and dissemination of

any information so as to not reflect that

it originated in Milwaukee or from RUSSELL.
