(12) Soil samples from HARRINGTON's farm in Plano,

Texas, will not be obtained as subjects have already admitted

that HARRINGTON's farm is where the televisions were stored, and

therefore, soil samples are not needed to prove that HARRINGTON'S

farm was the location where trailer from captioned theft was un-

loaded and the televisions were stored there.

(13) Interview of BILLY TEE DYER will not be conducted

as his attorney has been in contact with case Agent and stated he

would not give permission to interview DYER.

will not be covered since DONALD EUGENE MCGHEE admits he did not

attempt to sell a television to STROBLE.

did not purchase a television set from captioned theft from him.

(16) Contact with SO's, Henderson and Kaufman Counties

will not be made at this time as statements by subjects HALLMAN,

SCRIBNER and McGHEE show that none of the televisions from

captioned theft were dispersed in those counties.
