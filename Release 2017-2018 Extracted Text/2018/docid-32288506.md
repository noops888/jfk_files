as LITTLEPAGE is a Dallas PD informant and a request has been
made by the Dallas PD not to contact LITTLEPAGE at this time.

as CHARLES THOMAS SCRIBNER admits in statements. to FBI that she
has no knowledge regarding captioned theft.

Texas, will not be obtained as subjects have already admitted
that HARRINGTON's farm is where the televisions were stored, and
therefore, soil samples are not needed to prove that HARRINGTON's
farm was the location where trailer from captioned theft was un-
loaded and the televisions were stored there,

(13) Interview of BILLY TEE DYER will not be conducted
as his attorney has been in contact with case Agent and stated he
would not give permission to interview DYER,

(14) Attempts to locate and interview MIKE STROBLE
will not be covered since DONALD EUGENE McGHEE admits he did not
attempt to sell a television to STROBLE.

(15) Attempts to locate and interview VIRGINIA HOUSTON,
aka Virginia Miller, will not be covered as HARRINGTON admits she
did not purchase a television set from captioned theft from him.

(16) Contact with SO'’s, Henderson and Kaufman Counties
will not be made at this time as statements by subjects HALLMAN,
SCRIBNER and McGHEE show that none of the ‘televisions from ‘
captioned theft were dispersed in those counties.
