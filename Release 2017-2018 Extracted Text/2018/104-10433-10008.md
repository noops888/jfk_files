1. ‘he following is the(text of a cable from Chief, SR Division, sent
via closed from at cat) on 23 November, for the attention
of (fr. Angleton:

"1, I desire that you consider these reactions to the Kennedy
assassination:

a. Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio statements
fas heard in London\pttributed the assassination to “right-
ing elements." as the true identity of the believed
assassin became known did Moscow begin to complain that
U.S. reactionaries were using Oswald as a pawn.

Should not the assignment of 13th Dept. officers to the KGB |
esidency in United Nations in New York be considered
in a new light?)

T discovered fron| during our long
exceptionally valuable discussions, that one of Herold
Wilson's principal scientific advisors is Captain Ian Maxwell,

who has @ long Soviet intelligence background. This may
shed new light on AELADIE's report. /I.e., that Harold Wileon
be a Soviet agent7)

2. (putting it valdiy, was Oswald, unvittingly or wittingly, pert of
‘a plot to murder President Kemedy in Dalles es en attempt to
further exacerbate vectional strife end render the U.8. Government
less capsble of desling with Soviet initiatives over the next
‘f ABLADLE's views on Wilson end the information noted iif
jh le above have any substance (end they cannot be ignored)
thie suggests that we can expect major Soviet pressures over the
next seyeral months, for which the Soviets heve made ,
ong-range preparations .Y
2. Fhe above reference to 13th Dept. officers in New York refers tothe
foxesence, reported by en FBI penetration. of the KUB locally, in New York or
Washington of one or two known officers’ of the 13th Department of the ist Chief
Directorate (Foreign Intelligence) of the KGB. This proshpenipis is charged with

the way, met clendestinely with a Soviet "exchange student" froma .
Pennsylvania university during the school year 1962-63, which suggests that .
the Soviet student is also a 13th Dept. officer or agent. Perhaps
significantly, his course of studies was in food chemistry!

3. | you will note that Mr. Murphy's comments come without benefit of
traces. we passed to you earlier today, that Oswald had contact
th a 13th Dept., representative in Mexico City.

4, (another recently-arrived cable, being sent to the Director tonight,
fuggests that Oswald's business with the Soviet Consul was connected with his
own visa to the USSR and Cuba (in transit) and may, therefore, have been
really rather than ostensibly innocent.
