Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo

RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Miller also advised on 4-2-75 that their review of the Ellison

investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and

he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only

real solution to the situation seemed to be that she not be added to the staff.

Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard.

This request was conveyed to CIA by Section Chief William Cregar of the

Intelligence Division who subsequently advised that Charles Kane, Director of

Security, CIA, had reviewed the file on Ellison and agreed there was sufficient

cause to question her suitability for assigum ent to the Select Committee stat. n

Kane stated CIA Director Colby concurred in this observation.

These views were conveyed to Miller on 4-9-75.

Miller stated

at that time that they had resolved the situation by assigning Mrs. Ellison to

purely aaministrative tasks and that she would be fully isolated from any sensitive

or classitied intormation in connection with her responsibilities.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.
