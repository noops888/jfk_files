MR. BELMONT:

With reference to my conversation with the Director

last evening, concerning the ramifications arising out of

the Journal-American newspaper article, SAC Simon telephoned

I rom laz Angeles this asterioon and turnished the followin

information:

Los Angeles has recently developed a new potential

criminal informant by the name of Theresa Jean Cundall

claims to be a sister-in-law of the recently deceased motion

picture actor Dick Powell. Actually she is a high priced

prostitute.

Cundall has a contact by the name of Kathy Brown, who

in turn has dealings with a man by the name of Irving Mink.

We have no information as to the identities of either Brown

or. Mink, and none has as yet been supplied by our new informant.

She alleges, however, that in connection with West Coast trips,

Irving Mink is responsible for lining up two or three girls.

In connection with one trip the informant alleges she was

selected as one of the girls, but had to cancel out because

she was in the hospital.

Three girls are presented on each

occasion.

and one is selected. No money is passed at the time,

but subsequently Mink pays the girl chosen $500. The in-

formant named, as other girls having been involved in the

Ipast, Angie Dickerson and Judy McCarthy.

Our informant is maintaining contact with Brown

and may be able to secure for us information which will

identify Brown and Mink.
