Informant advised that he was always close to KAVNER,

and even though the Teamsters did not get the SCHEIB-contract

until after informant left the Teamsters, KAVNER got In touch

with him and discussed the situation. Informant knows that

at the time of the transfer KAVNER was spending a lot of time

with SCHEIB, and after KAVNER and SCHEIB returned from

San Francisco KAVNER had several meetings with DORIA.

Informant stated that he knows for a fact that

at about the time of the transfer KAVNER came up with

some money as at that time KAVNER paid off a loan KAVNER

had at the Erie Bank, Erie, Colorado. Informant related that

In about December, 1960, KAVNER came to him and said he needed

$10,000. In a hurry and

asked the informant's assistance in

helping him obtain a loan. KAVNER was introduced to PHIL

MATTHEW, who was then Executive Vice President of Empire

Financial Corporation, Van Nuys, California.

MAITHEW told

KAVNER that 1f KAVNER

had collateral he could arrange a loan

for KAVNER at the Erie Bank, Erie, Colorado, which is owned

by Empire. KAVNER wanted to obtain a loan just on the strength

of his signature and the signature of the informant as co-signer,

but MATTHEW would not make a loan on that basis.

KAVNER

then said he could put up stock as collateral, which MATTHEW

accepted, and the loan was made. Informant noted that at

the time he asked KAVNER 1f he had the stock why he did not

sell the stock and obtain the money instead of getting the loan,

to which KAVNER replied that the stock actually belonged to

a truck operator who was just signing the stock over to KAVNER

as a favor to assist KAVNER in obtaining the loan.

Informant noted that this was a six months loan,

and at about the time KAVNER closed the SCHEIB deal KAVNER

had the money to pay off the loan.

Informant noted that KAVNER 1s shrewd and probably

got the money to pay off this loan through a mortgage on his

house or another loan and is probably paying.off the indebtedness

incurred in this latter financing with the money he obtained

out of the SCHEIB deal.

He noted that this point should be

borne in mind If KAVNER's payment of the Erie Bank loan is

checked out.
