ADMINISTRATIVE (Continued)

On July 22, 1963, PCI THOMAS CLARK was contacted

DY SA RUSSEL F. SULLIVAN•

He advised that he had not heard from

"HAPPY" REYNOLDS for the

meeting which was to take place

on 7/18/63. CLARK advised that RAY WEAN and RICHIE BARRETT

are very

jumpy" and believe they are being followed most

of the time.

As a result of their nervous condition,

especially WEAN's, they have cancelled any activities, and

WEAN advised he does not intend to do anything untl the

heat is off.

Informant gave additional knowledge about alleged

hi-jacking activity in the New York City area.

On July23, 1963, PCI CLARK contacted SA SULLIVAN.

He advised that RICHIE BARRETI told him that their attorney

in NJ wanted to see him (CLARK) and BARRETT at 1:00 p.m.,

7/25/63. CLARK advised that the reason was not known by

BARRETT. The informant stated he was nervous over the matter,

as it was normal for the attorney to get in touch with him

(CLARK), and he has never received a message in this manner.

The informant brought up the point that if BARRETT suggests

a visit to the union headquarters, it could be possible that

the union is suspicious of the fact that CLARK is cooperating

with the authorities.

CLARK was assured that the union

would have no way of knowing this, and CLARK should be alert

for all information available if he visits the union office.
