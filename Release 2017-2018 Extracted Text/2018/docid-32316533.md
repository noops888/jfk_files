ADMINISTRATIVE (Continued)

On July 22, 1963, PCI THOMAS CLARK was contacted
by SA RUSSEL F, SULLIVAN. He advised that he had not heard from
"HAPPY" REYNOLDS for the meeting which was to take place
on 7/18/63. CLARK advised that RAY WEAN and RICHIE BARRETT
are very "jumpy" and believe they are being followed most
of the time. AS a result of their nervous condition,
especially WEAN's, they have cancelled any activities, and
WEAN advised he does not intend to do anything until the
heat is off.

Informant gave additional knowledge about alleged
hi-jacking activity in the New york City area.

on July23, 1963, PCI CLARK contacted SA SULLIVAN.
He advised that RICHIE BARRET! told him that their attorney
in NJ wanted to see him (CLARK) and BARRETT at 1:00 p.m.,
7/25/63. CLARK advised that the reason was not known by
BARRETT. The informant stated he was nervous over the matter,
as it.was normal for the attorney to get in touch with him
(CLARK), and he has never received a message in this manner.
The informant brought up the point that if BARRETT suggests
a visit to the union headquarters, it could be possible that
the union is suspicious of the fact that CLARK is cooperating
with the authorities. CLARK was assured that the union
would have no way of knowing this, and CLARK should be alert
for all information available if he visits the union office.
