WSHORAMDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBKCT: Meeting with Dr, Kanuel Antonio Yerona on 5 May in New York City,
1030 to 1315 hours :

3. Varona arrived the evening of 4 Fay and registered at the st. Merits:

Hotel, After severs] unsuccessful efforts to reach him tuere (because his plane
» I finally got hin -t about 2330 hours and -cheduled » meeting with hin

xt morning, I mst him in the lobby of the hotel, snd we spent the bet-
ter part of the next three houra in 2 stroll around C.ntral park and at lunch.
Yor the first hour or so Varona unloaded 2 nusber of thoughts on the current
“politioal situations most of these ve are already familinr with, but among the
points that he had to make were some which my be new and vhich are covered below.

. 2. Varona was shocked over the Senate Internal Security Subcomittets
choice of Col, UCALDE Carrillo to.testify before them, Varona describes this
person as an absolute war criminal who has no ‘business appearing before any
Official United States body. He sare that he might resign himself to the fact.
that in our democratic, parlimentary system ef fovernment such things ean hapr en,
there {5 not the slightest possibility that the aversge Latin American gould ever
wnleratand that this sction dose not represent the thinking of the entire United
States Government, When I tried to explain this in terms of our traditional
separation of powers betwocn the iegislativw and cxecutive irenohes, the fact
that we are in an eleotion year, and other extenuating Girounstances, Varona
expreasod amazement that we have no core of a sen:e of comen jiurpose hore in
this country than we apparently do, The Legislative Bronoh goes one direction

and the Exeoutive Branch goes another and there appears to be little ccordination
Lwiesen the twoe .

3. Varona was aleo quite unhappy sbout the apaoinl rrscedure vhich Lrst~
grvsion had given him whon he reaghad New Fork the night before, le thought
that he had been handled ina rather discourteous wy and could not underatand
why ho wae plesed on mrcle and instructed te keep In iigration and daturalisation
informed of hie addr: ot all tiase, I explained this srecinl procedure to hin
and emphasised the fact tint it wea something that we ladd on for only certain
Select soopla, that it was oviting through sounteins of red tapo in permitting
Visitors auch «es Verona to move sround the country or even to }eave it and return
without the norm] adainistretive diffioultins. This mollified him, and from
that point on 1 would ony that our convorsation was on A very cordinl plans

4. Neving just returned froa the Conference on Desoerney and Fresdom in
Caracas, Yarona tad = number of thourhts on tht, 1@ considered the Conference
& great success from tha standpoint of the liberal ‘ubane who had opposed any
Fesolution approving the Castro regine, aid there was o strong nove afoot to
yat over such » resolution but that he, “ancher Armngo, Joss Ignacio xasco and
others were able to keep such a resolution from being passed. Tre min svonsors
of this, ty say, were members cf the left wing of the tec!on Denocrstica of
Venesusla, ie also said that a nusber of -eople of lib ral tendencies attonded
the meeting with gross nisconce;tions concersing tne nature of th Castro regine
and that he and the cther Cubans th-t I mentioned were able to convert a number
of these, Among them were Allende (fu) of Argentina >nd several others shose
names he has recorded, In other -ords, som good uission: Ty work wus done st the
Conference, In terms of official rosulta, there was very little. He told m
that the agenda waa not terribly well worked out, that the people in attendance
at the Con“erence were of any political hues nd that nothing of great interest
took place on the floor itself but rather in reivate caucuses and srall mestings
‘behind the scenes. I'll mention sone of the results of the Conference which are
ef interest to us operationally in succseding Paragraphs.

5. He cuite naturally had n great deal to sny vbout the Castro regine and
he pointed out three nreas in which Castro enjoys a great sropnganda adventage
today, areas which we vould be well advised to keep in mind in planning our om
propogenda. These ore the following:

@. Castro's conversion of former militory barracks into schools, This |;
: bas been a tremendous propaganda succzas for Castro, He hae managed.
to soft-nedal completoly the frat that he's built now barracks and that
the arny is now bigger than it-ever hea beens

b. The latent niotrust or outright dislike of the United Stetes in the
minde of most Latin Americana, Castro hae bi able to play this theme
backward and forwrd, openly and tacitly, with great success.

©. The apparent affinity of the United ctetes! Jenate for former supporters
of the Ratista regime, This has hewn touched-on in an earlier paragraphs

6. Varona told mo that he planned te fo to Kiam’ on 6 Hay and return to
Kew York City on the eighthor the morning of the ninth. During these two or three
days in Mined he wants to find an oprrtawnt, lie il) return to tlew York in time
for the reeting of other Cuban oprosition leaders, inoluting Justo Carrillo,

" Rseog and others, and has no intention at tila tims Gf going to Washington,

: PROPAGSEDA

8, Daring our conversation Zerona mde a number of points which my be of
walve in connection with our fortheoaing propoganda progren, everal of our
- wilnerabilities I've referred to in one of the earlier paragraphs, and we should
do whatever we can to repair them, Another point of interest wes varona's feeling H
townrd Francisco ICHASO, Thia gentleman used to be a writer of editorials for
Diario de la Marina, and he has sleo worked for Bohemia and station CiQ. He was
rtetaat one time, Vorona hae a very high regard for him asa writer and
feels that he can be useful if he writes anonymously or under a pen namo. He is .
most ancious to bring him out and will undoubtedly plan on using him for propaganda
writing if and when ichaso gets out of Cuba, Concerning the Carscas Conference
which just finished, Varona told me that the speech which Caldera (I believe it
Se Rafael Caldera) unde at the closing section was, in his om words, "formidable",
7 \p tremendous apeeah, Thia, for sue reason, has not been publicized either in
“Latin Amerioa or here in the United States, eccording to Varona, It would be
very good for us to do everything peasitle to spread the word of Caldera throughout.
the hentephore, Varona also ssid that iduardo FREI Montalva of Chile spoke
extremely wel..on the opening cay but that his-remorke were'off-the-cuff and there
probably ie no written record of what Froi had to say.

9. Before leaving Caruons, Varona organized a nucleus of a propeganda outlet
thore, He expects to use Carnoxe as a distribution center for propsgands through=
out South Amerioa and the Caribbean, He had @ talk with Preeldent Betancourt
. there who approved this activity. Betancourt told Yarona henceforth to go direstly

to the Minister of Treasury, NAYORBE, as his official contact.

10, Yerons ehytcusly hae a great «nny ideas on the rolitienl flolds He has”
& representative in Caracas, »6 I have mentioned, and he hopes within the near
future to have hie ow people in every country of the hemisphere «5 agit-prop
types. One of the men that he oxpects to use for this type Amalio PIALLO, wha te
now in Miami and whe hay been mentioned in communications to the field and a a
memorandum from WDDALR. Fiallo fe @ Gubaa, a forner mmber of Age, Satod
Hels extremely wolleoriented politdeally and an oxoeallort speaker. Fiallo pr
only one mintake in tile polition. eareer, necording to Varona, Thiet was in 1954,
wien he suprorted the idea of eleationa under the Hatistn regime, fie hus since

Ti, Varons told me thet before leaving Cuba he uas able to orgynise a
ceaplete underground movement of soor-le vho ere not openly identified with the
Autentico Movezent.

12, Concerning a site for a future Junta. Governnent—in-exile, Directorio
or vhat have you, varona doubte thet Costa kiiea will bo suitable, ielations
between “Pepe” Figueres and President cchandi are rot as good ns they would have
to be for Figueres to obtain the approval of Ychindi for such activities, There
would be no problem in holding 2 nceting or series of reetinge of tiis group in
San Jose, but as a permanent site, it is doubtful, in Varona's opinion. (1
didn't bring up the concept of a governzent-in-exile or ony of the attendant
Yogol problems, so we didn't discuss this. In xy view it would be better for
the Bender-Carr group to raise the point.) mae

13, then I asked hin then what vould be a better permanent site for the
directing body, he said that Kexieo would be good, but the United States would
undoubtedly heve to be the uain cesenbly point for these psople.

Us. Varona raised the question of Sanches Arango, He leang in favor of
baving Sanches Join the Directornte, if I may o.1l it that, He did say that
Sanches, like Rubio Fadilla, has to be handled with kid gloves. For example,
Sanches should never attend a meeting of Cubans and their smerionn advisors,
®.g. Mr. Bender or Mr. Carr, for the recson that to Sanches Arongo this would
appear te be servitude on the part of the Cubans towards the Amerianns, nd if
et any later date he had a difference of opinion with the other Cubans in the
group, he night charge them with teing lackeya cf the Ameriosns. with this in
mind, Varona recommended that we talk to Jancher Arango separately before he
Joins any Cuban group under our sponsorship.

15. When I gave Varona the letter frox Juan Antonio Rubio Padilla, he asked
we what I thought of iublo., In non-cocmittal fashion I turned the question around
to Varona himself, At this, he emiled and poused ¢ long time and thon told me
that Rubio was a fine min but thet he hnd lost two acna who died of the sume
{Lineoa, that this hna mode of him, if not a bitter man, one who retains hie
Andepandence to an extreme, This is hie iwinoipal characteristic, volitically,
he fo -uite conservative but free of any involvauent with the Nutists regi,

Neate a men whe Mkes to work alone and who le net inolined to go slong with the
will of the uajority in situiticns like the prasent one wiere nemoors of ‘the
opposition to Castro are trying to orparite despite internal politieal difforences,

46, In connection with hia ontry at Idlewild on & Hay, Varona asked Carr
for some help when Carr called hin intar in thw evening. Carr in turn referred
him to a gentleman named Leon Vennen wtie itves at 77 lark Terrace rast and hae
two telephone: A QaUbiy and LU J-hh72. Dennan telechonad Varona on the torning
of $ May at Varona's hotel «nd voluntesred to help varona with ony problems he

What the special procecure involved, Verona any no further need to talk to
Dennen, However, 1 suzgesteswie cleck “ith Carr to find out how this man got”
Ante our operation.

17. The political part of our discussion was to have followed a formt
which Mr, Droller snd I worked out before I left. It was to inulude a ritionsle
for the present United States’ position in Latin imerica and was to cover such
items ao his travel to ashington, but the conversation quickly took such < turn
that I made a couple of on-theespot changes, ‘or one thing, Yarona 1a quite
femiliar with United Ststes’ thinking on Cuba and is unhappy stout it. in the
respects I have menticned carlier, but :t least he's sophisticated enough to
undoratand the whys and vherefor One fairly inportant point witeh we did cover,
however, concerned the Eender-Carr group. { told Varona very frankly that certain
sotivities were not within my province but there was a group that i wae sware of,
headed by Sr. Carr (whose name incidentally Varona hed mentione: to ce first),
that this group was completely relisble and rell-intentioned and did have the
proper contacts with our government and that he should have no reservations about

with this group. it this same time, I gave Yrrona my own emorgency

telephone number, MB 5-0469, in case he should have any probleme with United States!
euthorities such se INS. 4nd I also discussed with him a nunbor of figures of
importance in the Caribbean political situnt{on—-intelligo:ice netters «hich an
Ameriean officinl would have interest in, The subjects that I "avoided" were
parantlitary and the <uestion of conversion of yasoa for do!lare. He didn't
bring up the point an we tolked about so wany other things thet I desided te
leate this one for the attention of the Sonder-Cerr group, ne it looked like,
& good opportunity for them to help Varona out and thereby vatablish that auch
more rapport.

18. Varone told ne that in the twelvo hours or so thet he'd now been in
New York he had already received an approach from Zusablo Mujal, the former
ohief of the CIC under Batista, Through a in named Alberto or ‘lfrado cruz,
Mujnl sont word that he recognized that any return to the statug quo under Batista
de now out of the .uestion ard that he is willing to tury old differences and
work in cunplete harmony with such ;eople ea ‘Tony Yarona with the single ohJective
of ridding Cuba of Fidel Castro. Varona is not going to roject this proposal
out of hand but ia going to study it very carefully -nd tlk to some of his Cuban
@olleagues about it, In this connection, it le interesting to note thut Varona
and porheps othor Cubana may woll be. softening towards-the former “untouchable*

STATBRAIN

: 20, Varona told xe that he had lined up a ham radio operator in Carac+s,
Venesuela and that he wished to institute a radio echedule between a mn in the
Niexi area and the ont in Veneauels to give him communication with his croup
dom there. This pattern ws established curing the Datista regive by the rebel
units; "and it is desirable now, according to Varona, in view of the atrocious
Comuniestion facilities between Caracas and the United States, I suggested
ghat we migtt be able to help him set up the American end of thie net. :

21, when I brought up the point of establishing staybehind como with his
in Cuba to be in readiness in the event of a break in relations with the
United States, he was «uite enthusiastic. He is going to aoxe up with noms of |<
people who could come to this country for three or four weeks for the necessary
tome training and then go back in to .ork transmitters-receivors und/or to
¢rein others. I also promised Varona that we could mke radio trananitter=
