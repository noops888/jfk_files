FOREWORD

This account of CIA and U.S. Goverment involverent in the

Vietnamese generals' coup of 1 November 1963 18 drawn fron

documentary sources. Not all of the documents summarized or

quoted bear directly on the coup itself... We included some that

may seem Irrelevant, because they illuminate the assosphere in

which U.S. Government policy decisions were reached.

We interviewed only three people in the course of this

Inguiry: William Colby, Chief of FE Division at the tige (and now);

John Richardson, Chief of Station during the coup plotting of

August 1963; and David Snith, Acting Chief of Station at the time

of the coup/assassination of November 1963. Each asrired us that

he knew of no CIA assassination schemes against Diem--other than

the role played by CIA in maintaining contacts, by direction, vith

the Vielnamese generals.

Many of the documents upon which this report is based are

classified TOP SECRET. Since the report is being delivered

personally and in only one copy, we have chosen not to subject

It to the external accountability controls that are entailed in

a TOP SECRET classification.

•On the following page 1s a list of U.S. Goverment officials

whose ranes are mentioned in the report, together with the positions

they held at the time."

"At 0745 hours, Richardson, Spera and Conein, latter two of

mornine, were shown a mogenge from Cescrul Tijius iu Geuerti harkias stating

aspects of Vietnay situation being reviewed at White House and cormenting

that second thoughtswere beginnirg in Washington.

Faced with this

information and given strictly linited. time factors, Richardson

decided that the reeting with Gereralls linh and Khier should not be

postponed but that contacting officers would make this meeting a fact-

finding mission without encouraging or discouraging General Minh.

"When Spera and Corein returned from their recting with Khiem

and Minh, we proceeded to Trucheart's office to make our report.

The

Ambassador came in and Richardson advised him of our meeting with

General Hecac, i Taylor's cubie, and of the decisions which Richardson

had made as a result of the Taylor cable. Lodge was angry and

expressed the view that Richardson's decision had destroyed the

possibilities of carrying out a coup. Richardson expressed a firm m

dissenting opinion."

The consensus was that Harkins should confirm to the generals that

the approaches from CIA were bona fide and represented the views of the

on what the generals were in fact planning to do and whether 1t was

militarily feasible. A telegran giving the sense of the neeting was

Vice Presidential Meeting on Vicinam. CIA participants: DDCI,

DDP, & C/FT.

Record by C/FE.

Rusk suggested we look at precisely what in the Vietnam

situation made us think of a coup and what might be done to improve

conditions in Vietnam. Mclamara suggested the first requirement vas

reestablishment of communication hetween Lodge and Harkins. Rusk

directed that a telegram be prepared for Saigon making suggestions

as to what ve might ask the GN to do.

Chief, FE, to participated in the seetings of late August,

In a menoranium for halter Elder prorided this summary of

differing positions taken.

"In the discussions during the past week, the position of the

Department of State, led by Ball, Harrivan, and Hilsman, was that the

Diem-inu government had double-crossed the US Governsent because of

the attack on the pegodas and that US obligatiors to the government

were no longer valid.

Further, that a goverament so discredited could

not conduct successfully the war in Vietnam and would prove an

undesirable liability to the US Government elsewhere in Asia. Because of

these moral, military and political conclusions, the: Department

recommended that it mist give all support to & group of generals who

allegedly were disaffected to the point that a clear indication of US

action was the only ingredient lacking for them to push over a discredited,

unopular and weak Diem government.

"The position of the Department of Detense was that while 1t

depiored the sensational aspects of the Buddhist situation, it

nonetheless felt that an effort should be contimed to deal with Diem

and try to bring about a compromise, end at the sane time to keep in

touch with the generals and support the coup efforts, if this proved to

be the only alterrative left. This was essentially the view of General

Presidentiel Meeting on Vietnam. CIA participants: DCI, DDP.

& C/FE.

Record by DDP i C/FE.

It was suzgested that in the Ambassador's absence, Harkins,

Trueheart, and David Snith act as a committee. to direct any coup

operation. DOI countered with the view that Smith should not be

Involved in such a polley-making function, although he would be 1a

a position to provide technical advice to Harkins and Trueheart as

vell as carry out their instructions in the operational fleld. The

President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not clearly in

favor of the coup, we should discourage its launching. The Attorney

General felt the US was risking too much based on flimsy evidence.

The DCI stated his view that even a successful coup would create a

period of interregnim and confusion which misht only be solved by :

& second or third coup.

• do not think ve bare the pour chat

this 16 a Vietnamese affair.

• • I believe we should continue

our present position of keeping hands off but continue to monitor

and press for more detailed information. CAS has been analyzing

forces for some time and it is their estimate that the generals have

probably figured their chances pretty closely. ..

•. • It does

not seem sensible to have the military in charge of a matter which

In so profoundly political as a change of govemment..•

As to requests fron the generals, they may well have need of funds

at the last moment with which to buy off potential orposition.

To

the extent that these finds can be passed discrectly, I believe we

should furnish they..

was going to fail, ve would of course do everything ve could to

CIA cable from Saizon (SAIG 2094)

Cable fras lodge (In Its entirety): "Thanks for your sagacious

Instruction.

Will carry out to dest of hy ability.

1 November

The coup began at 1315 hours, Saigon time, which is equivalent

to 0015 hours, Washington time, 1 November. The following account

18 drawn from several sources: the Saigon Station's history of the

coup and varlous cables:

At 1315 hours, the Alde de Camp to General Don came to Conein's

house, told his that the coup was in progress, and said that General

Don wanted Conein at Joint General Staff (JCS) headquarters. The

aide also asked Conein to bring with him as much soney, is Corein

could readily lay hands upon. The station had stored five million

plasters (about $68,000 at the official rate) in a safe in Conein's

house against such a contingency. Conein took three million with

him. General Don used the money to revard opposition military units

who Joined the coup group. On 2 November, General Don Laformed

Conein that he needed money to pay the families of persons killed

during the coup. Conein gave Ceneral Don an additional 1,750,000

plasters.

One bundle of 250,000 piasters was overlooked and was found

later In Conein's safe. The passing of tbese funds le obviously

a very sensitive matter. Dave Smith reported by cable: on 25 November

1953 that the disbursement had not yet been discussed with the

Ambassador. The files do not show shether the Ambassador vas

ever told. In a State cable from Saigon of 24 April 1954, Lodge

reports & neeting he had thai day with General Minh... It reads in

part:

"He then said:

'I want to ask you a question about a money

matter.

Did Conein ever give General. Don money for the lovember 1

coup?"

"I said: "Definitely not.

vould certainly have known it, in lad he done such a

ting, I.

We asked Dave Snith about this, and he said he thought that the

Ambassador had eventually been told that the money had been passed.

We can neither confirm nor refute from the record.

Thus, Conein went to JGS headquarters and remained at the

arand post throughout the struggle. Before leaving bis home,

Conein alerted the station by radio. Upon arriving at JGS headquarters,

Coneis was told by General Don that Don had tried unsuccessfully to

reach Conein earlier by telephone.. A later check revealed that

Conein's telephone was out of order. Conein was told that he vas to

keep a telephone line open to the Ambassador. Because there vas a CIA

officer on the scere and In intinate contact vich the coup priacipals,

the station was able to report almost minute-by-minute progress of

the coup.

The fact that Conein was at JGS headquarters 1s well known in

official circles. On 24 October, headquarters had cabled the station:

"In future do not repeat not put nessage re coup plots or runors in

CRITIC channel. Rather you should slug them INEDIATE ATTENTION FOR

BRENT. " As a consequence, the first cabled reports from the station

came in as regular CIA cables and vere put onto the CRITIC network

here at headquarters. The first cable was received at headquarters

at 0117 hours, Washington time, and was filed on the CRITIC network

at 0159. At 0256 hours, following receipt of the sixth non-CRITIC

cable, headquarters instructed the station to put the coup reporting

on the CRITIC netuork at the station. Sometime during the day of

1 November. (the.confirmation copy of the cable lacks'& date/time

step) headquarters cabied a varning to the station against including

the names of CIA personnel in 1ts CRITIC cables. Cosein 1s Identified

by name and as being at JGS headquarters in eleven CRITIC messages,

seven of which were put into the CRITIC channel, vithout the name

being deleted, here at headquarters.

- At 1030 hours 2 November (in Saigon) the Saigon radio announced

that both Diem and Nhu had cormitted suicide by taking poison. Later

Palace shortly after 0700 hours on 2 lovember by a tunnel unknown

to the gencrals.. They left the tunnel In the dock area and went to

a Catholic church in Cholon where they took poison. They vere

discovered at the church at 1030 hours.

We do not have a truly reliable account of the circunstances

of thelr deaths, but they certainly were not by suicide. According

to one of Conein's reports, Diem called General Don at 0650 hours

2 November and offered to surrender unconditiorally. Ceneral Minh

- Irmediately ordered all telephones removed fron rooms in their JGS

conmand post area. This cut off all communication with the outside

except for radios under Minh's control.

$.

On 16 November 1963 a field-grade officer of the JGS, who was

deeply involved in the coup and whose rellabilliy the station could

not judge (nor did 1t name him), gave a station officer two photographs

of the bodies of Diem and Nhu, which he claimed he had taken at the

request of General Kim. The photographs show that the deaths were

very bloody. The source gave the following account of the deaths:

The officer was present when the Military Revolutionary

Connittee debated the ultimate disposition of the brothers,

accompanied tie force that apprehended them, and witnessed the

events immediately after their deaths. He was not present in

- the M-l13 armored personnel carrier at the time of the deaths.

A lengthy argunent took place on the night of 1-2 November

as to the ultimate disposition of Diem and Nhu, with most of the

generals favoring their execution. The ultimate decision vas

To recap:

a. CIA was not in favor of the decision to abandon the

Dien regime, but faithfully carried out instructions.

D. CIA officers Conein and Spera vere the contacts tith the

coup generals, but only as approved and under instructions.

C. A CIA OfficeI, Conein, vas at the generals' corand
