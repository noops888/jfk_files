in_& memorancim for Walter Elder provided this summary of e 4
differing positions taken. Z

“In the discussions during the past week, the position of the
Department of State, led by Ball, Harrinan, and Hilsman, was that the
Diem-Kau government had ‘double-crossed the US Governnent because of
the attack on the pegodas and that US obligations to the governzent
were no longer valid. Further, that a government so discredited could
not conduct successfully the var in Vietnam and vould prove an
undesirable liability to the US Government elsewhere in Asia. Because of
these moral, military and political conclusions, the. Department
recomended that it mst give all support to a group of generals who
allegedly were disaffected to the point that a clear. indication of US
action vas the only ingredient lacking for them to push over a discredited, *
unpopular and weak Diem governnent.

"The position of the Department of Detense was that while it
Gepiored tne sensational aspects of the Buddhist situation, it we
nonetheless felt that an effort should be contimed to deal vith Diem
and try to bring about a compromise, end at the saze tize to keep in
touch with the generals and support the coup efforts, if this proved to
be the only alternative left. This vas essentially the view of General :
Harkins and of Arbassdor Nolting. This vas considered by the Department |
of State to be a foot-dragging and weak position, :

of AID, what specific actions Phillips would recommend and he

suggested “cutting aid to Colonel Tung which would be viewed

"a vigorous American position." In general, though, aid cuts —
were discussed in terms of bringing pressure on Diem to make
"needed changes in his regime. Hovever planned or hovever
looked upon by the U.S. adwinistration, it is clear that the
Vietnamese generals coicidered the officinl confirmation of
aia cuts as a clear token of U.S. support of their coup planning. 7

The suspension of aid did not force Diem and Nhu to mend their

ways, but it did create an atmosphere that made it easier for

the generals to assenble the military support. needed for a

The coup began at 1315 hours, Saigon time, vhich is equivalent

“At 1315 hours, the Aide de Camp to General Don came to Coneints ** ‘ i ved

house, told him that the coup was in progress, and said that General

Don vanted Conein at Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters. The

aide alco asked Conein to bring with him as much money as Conein

1963 that the disbursement had not yet been discussed with the

Ambassador. ‘The files do not’ chow vhether the Anbassador vas
ever told. Ina State cable from Saigon of 2h April 1954, Lodge

matter. Did Conein ever give General, Don money for the November 1
coup?!

We acked Dave Snith about this, ond he said he thought that the _
Anbassador had eventually been told that the money had been passed. .:
