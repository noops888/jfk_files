Seretustens.

Results of this review of Sub‘ect's file do not support the

allegations made ty DIAZ Lanz. Although the two ma‘or areas oF Goust
recain scevhat unresolved, the weight of evidence would seem to te
in the Scbject's favor.

5.

a. Agency and Bureac fYles contain no identifiable resort
of Scbject's father.

bd. AXTIME hinself volunteered information corcerning bots

the cited areas cpen to poss‘ble question. “he Stbfect
had every reason to belfere that the infoszation
volunteered (i.e. that his father’s exsuis‘on from tte
Party was reported in Foz, ard that the IN24 meeting
was covered by a reporter from Pevalucio=) could be
easily verified. erceoreeeerrerrs

©. The rece:d of AXTIMS's polygraph examination stated
that strong polygrarh evidence had been c:
Subject was 2 bona fide anti-Castro and anti—Commsiss
defector; that INGA had held a xeeting around the
middle of Octoter at which Subject was present; and
that the letter of resimaticn addressed to Fidel vas
written ty hin and that it was generally accurate in
reporting the INZA meeting.

d. There has been no evidence in FI/D that 427T is
other than what he clains to be.

Comment.

Dave Morales, SM#ATE/CI, has additionaly commented that <here

4s no love lest betsren AXCIMS ard DIAZ Lanz and that the lateer's
allegations against the former are probably false. In view of DIAT
Lanz! feelings against ARTINS, it is not uilixely that he is encearor-
