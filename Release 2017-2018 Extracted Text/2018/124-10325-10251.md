lhe operations of the CIA station in Havana, Cuba,

BRACKETS

received a crippling blow in September, 1960, when Cuban

G-2 authorities discovered that CIA operatives had established/ha

a technical surveillance on the Overseas China News Agency MMS

which had offices located in the Centro Medico Building in

Havana, Cuba.

Cuban G-2 evidently became aware of this CIA

operation due to the fact that various CIA operatives,

who were noticeably North Americans, were frequenting

apartment in the Centro Medico Building. In the general

round-up, the Cuban authorities arrested two U. S. Embassy

employees, one being MIS. MARJORIE A ALENNOX, an employee

of the Commercial Section, and a Mr NEET, who was listed-

as a Third Secretary at the U. S. Embassy but who was actually

a CIA agent.

Also arrested were four undercover operatives

of CIA who are North Americans.

The Cuban Government was

also able to confiscate much technical equipment which was

used in this technical surveillance:

Photographs of the

technical equipment were published in the Havana newspaper

"Revolucion, "

and consisted of numerous tape recorders,

and other monitoring equipment.

In connection with this operation, various other

CIA operatives in Havana were compromised. Included among

these were the following who were assigned as officers at

the U.S. Embassy, Havana, Havana,0a:

ROBERT D. WIECHA, DAVID

BECK.

(FNU)" DE/ CASTRO, and

another female employee of the

U. S.

Embassy who

DECLASSI

was secretary to the Administrative

Officer and Security Advisor, CAROLYN O. STACY. It appears

that actually she was the one who was working in an under-

cover capacity for CIA and not MARJORIE A. LENNOX who was

the one arrested by Cuban authorities.

U.S

SECRET

From conversations with c

representatives, it

appeared that the agents were compromised because they were

seen to be in direct contact with the undercover operatives

whom CIA had placed in Cuba. The CIA agents assigned to

the Embassy evidently mixed

socially with the CIA undercover

operatives and in this manner became known to Cuban authorities.

Another 'CIA

representative, DAVID MORALES, has

also been recalled to the United States as it has beén

feared that his contact with counterrevolutionary groups

(in Havana, Cuba, might be known to Cuban G-2.

With

respect to the four operatives who were

undercover and who are presently being detained by Cuban police,

these individuals have not been seen by any representatives

of the U. S. Embassy for the past month. The Cuban Government

has given no indication as to what penalty they might suffer.

CIA station Chief,

has expressed his concern

to the Legat, Havana, concerning the possible action which

the Cuban Government might take against these individuals.

One source informed Legat he was informed by a G-2

representative that the Cuban Government might ask for the

death penalty for these four, but that if such penalty is

decreed, it would be reduced

to a jail term of 30 years.

The present set-up of the CIA station in Havana

is as follows:

5)

Chief

ARTHUR AVIGNON, former Bureau agent who has

been on transfer to Rio de Janeiro for the

past month, Assistant Chief. He has explained

that his transfer has been delayed due to the

fact that if he is removed, it is doubtful

whether any replacement would be sent in his

stead.

BENJAMIN

CEVANS, JR. is presently in the

United States and it is not known whether there

are plans for him to return tó Cuba.

The office has a complement of five girls.
