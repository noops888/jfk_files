The ‘operations of théG station in Havana, Cuba, *9
received a crippling blow in pic iobap 1960, when Cuban “ :
G-2 authorities discovered that, CIA operatives had established /}iff a fe
a technical surveillance on the Overseas China News Agency'},/\\ ae xia
which had offices located in the Centro Medico Building in yw 3
Havana, Cuba. }

Cuban G-2 evidently became aware of this CIA
Operation due to the fact that various CIA operatives,
who were noticeably North Americans, were frequenting an
jlapartment in the Centro Medico Building. In the general
_,., round-up, the Cuban authorities arrested two U. S. Embassy
employees, one being Mrs. MARJORIE / INOX, an employee
i of the Commercial Section, and a ie? , who was listed-
jas a Third Secretary at the U. Ss. assy but who was actually .
in| a CIA agent. Also arrested were four undercover operatives
(of CIA who are North Americans. The Cuban Government was
palso able to confiscate much technical equipment which was
‘used in this technical surveillance. Photographs of the _ D
, technical equipment were published in the Havana newspaper Xs) ¥
~~ "Revolucion," and consisted of numerous tape recorders, ae “Ty.

\ and other monitoring equipment. . N
In connection with this operation, various other We
MICIA operatives in Havana were compromised. Included among +
is these were the following who were er at f
the U. S. Embasgyy Havana, Cuba: ROBERT Do
CK, (FNUY"D) (CASTRO, and another femalé emp
S. Embassy who was secretary to the Administrative
Officer and Security Advisor ».CAROLYN ( KA{STACY. It appears
that actually she was the one who was woiking’ in an under-
cover capacity for CIA and not MARJORIE A. LENNOX who was
the one arrested by Cuban authorities. o 4 ae FI

From conversations wth 7A | it
appeared that the agents were compromised because they were
seen to be in direct contact with the undercover operatives
whom CIA had placed. in Cuba. The CIA agents assigned to
the Embassy evidently mixed socially with the CIA undercover
operatives and in this manner became known to Cuban authorities.

LSE.
Another & representative, DAVIDIMORALES , has

also been recalled to the United Statés as it has been
feared that his contact with counterrévolutionary groups
in Havana, Cuba, might be known to Cuban G-2.

vA -

_ With respect to the four operatives who were
undercover and who are presently. being detained by Cuban police,
these individuals have not been seen by any representatives
of the U. S. Embassy for the past month. The Cuban Government
has given no indication as to t penalty they might suffer.

(of CIA station Chief, come expressed his concern
5, to the Legat, Havana, concerning the possible action which
Ae the Cuban Government might take against these individuals.

ue One source informed Legat he was informed by a G-2
representative that the Cuban Government might ask for the
death penalty for these four, but that if such penalty is
decreed, it would be reduced to a jail term of 30 years.

The present set-up of the CIA station in Havana
is as follows: :
: ief
GNON, former Bureau agent who has
been’ offi transfér to Rio de Janeiro for the
pee past month, Assistant Chief. He has explained
J that his transfer has been delayed due to the
Q fact that if he is removed, it, is doubtful
v - whether any replacement would be sent in his
‘S stead. 4
ae ANTHONY LASTLEO
WILLIAM J, ‘4
BENJAMIN. C ¢ iS; JR. is presently, in the
( “United sta statés and it is not known whether there
5 are plans for him to return to Cuba.
