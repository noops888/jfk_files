IX. ALLEGATION BY GILBERTO NOLASCO ALVARADO UGARTE

The first confidential source abroad advised that

on November 25, 1963, GILBERTO NOLASCO ALVARADO UGARTE, a

Nicaraguan citizen born January 31, 1940, in Ciudad Rama,

Departmento velaya, Nicaragua, made contact with the United

States Embassy at Mexico, D. F., and advised the following:

ALVARADO entered Mexico illegally from Guatemala on

August 29, 1963, traveled to. Mexico, D. F., and subsequently

made contact with EDELBERTO TORRES, a Nicaraguan communist

residing in Mexico City. From this contact a plan was

developed for ALVARADO to travel to Cuba to study guerrilla

warfare tactics.. He had occasion to visit the Cuban Consulate

In Mexico, D. F., several different times for the purpose of

obtaining travel docusentation for Cuba by furnishing false

identification papers as a Mexican citizen.

ALVARADO claimed that the real purpose behind his

proposed travel to Cuba was a penetration mission for the

Nicaraguan Secret Service. He stated that on September 18,

1963, he went to the Cuban Consulate, and while sitting in

the waiting room saw a group of approximately eight persons

enter the Consulate and the office of Cuban Consul EUSEBIO

AZCUE. A person unknown to him was sitting at AZUE's desk.

A short time later, while ALVARADO was standing near the door

to the men's room at the Cuban Consulate, he noticed three

men conversing a few feet away from him.

One of them was a

tall, thin Negro with reddish hair; the second was a man whom

ALVARADO had seen previously holding a Canadian passport.in

the waiting room of the Cuban Consulate; and the third person,

according to ALVARADO, WaS LEE HARVEY OSWALD.

ALVARADO stated that a tall Cuban Joined the above

group momentarily and passed some United states currency to

the Negro.

The following conversation between the Negro and

OSWALD was overheard by ALVARADO:

Negro (in English): I want to kill the man.

OSWALD: You're not man enough. I can do it.

Negro (in Spanish): I can't go with you. I have

a lot to do.

OSWALD: The people are waiting for me back there.

ALVARADO stated that the Negro then gave OSWALD

$6,500 in United States currency of large denominations,

saying':

"This isn't much." Of this sum, $1,500 was for extra

expenses. The Negro also gave OSWALD about 200 Mexican pesos.

In aister interview, ALVARADO stated that the

United States bank notes were in a small pack about one fourth

of an inch thick, bound with a paper band, which the Negro

broke before counting out $1,500 extra for expenses and $5,000

as "advance payment."

ALVARADO stated that OSWALD had carried a green

passport in his pocket, and he believed he saw OSALD wearing

a pistol in a shoulder

holster; but he was not sure of this

point. He stated that OSWALD had long shoes and a wrist watch

with a yellow metal band. According to ALVARADO OUT

appeared to be completely at home at the Consulate and to know

and to be known by Cuban Consulate personnel:

ALVARADO was arrested and interrogated by Mexican

authorities on November 28, 1963, and a copy of the interro

gation report by the Mexican authorities revealed the following:

At the outset ALVARADO's story generally resembled

that recorded above.

He repeated to the Mexican authorities

the details of the scene in which be saw the Negro, the

Canadian and the American conversing together, the delivery

of the money to the American by the Negro, and the conversation

he overheard.

ALVARADO advised the interviewing Mexican offictals

that upon seeing the photograph of OSWALD in the newspapers

following the assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY, he

recognized OSWALD as the American he had seen at the Cuban

Consulate.

An excerpt from ALVARADO®s statement to Mexican

authorities, as translated from Spanish, is as follows:

spontaneously and after reconsidering he

desires to state that the imerican to whom he

referred in the body of his statement and whom

he saw the l8th of September of this year in the

Cabar Consulate had a certain resemblance, about

sixty per cent, to LEE HARVEY OSWALD (assassin

of the President of the United States);

Thạt

after the assassination of President KENNEDY the

witness took advantage of this fact in his favor

to exploit it, furnishing versions such as those

initially set

an energetic reaction from the political point of

view on the part of the United States of America

against the government of FIDEL CASTRO RUZ and

that he kad no motive other than the profound

hatred he feels for communism.

That all his life

the witness has dedicated himself to combating

communisn and be regrets at this moment not having

accomplished his objective in the sense of causing

a reaction on the part of the American Government

against FIDEL CASTRO."

Because of the fact that subsequent to making the

above-mentioned statement to Mexican authorities, ALVARADO

claimed that he had changed his statement because of fear,

he was interviewed at considerable length on December 5 and

6, 1963, In Mexico, D. F., by representatives of the United

States Government.

T-17 advised as follows:

After reiterating his story, ALVARADO was afforded

a polygraph examination on December bg 19b3. Juring the course

of the examination he was asked, "Is this the American you sar

in the Cuban

Consulate?"

At the time he was shown photographs

of OSWALD.

rach time he was asked this question, he definitely

responded, "Yes," but it was noted that the polygraph indicated

a "deception response" on these answers.

These responses and

those with respect to other questions led to the conclusion

that ALVARADO was a fabricator.

It was specifically pointed

out to him that the polygraph indicated that he was not being

truthful in identifying photographs of OSWALD as being

of a person he saw in the Cuban Consulate, and he was asked

for his explanation thereof.

ALVARADO replied that he had full faith in the

polygraph and would not attempt to relute its results.

went on to say that the only explanation he could offer was

that he had seen an American in the Cuban Consulate on

September 18, 1963, who resembled OSWALD, and that upon

seeing the photograph of OSWALD in the newspaper, he built

up within himself, either consciously or subconsciously, a

complete belief that the person he had seen in the Cuban

Allegation by SALVADOR DIAZ VERSON

Concerning OSWALD and SILVIA DURAN

According to the first confidential source abroad,

the White House at lashington; 1. Ce, had received a paper

entitled "Possible Psychological Motivations In the Assassi

nation of President KENNEDY" written by JOSE I, LASAGA, 2340

N. E. Ith Avenue, Apartment 4, Miami, Florida,

This speculative paper attempted to establish that

the motivation of OSWALD in the assassination of President

KENNEDY waS FIDEL CASTRO or a CASTRO agent and that OSWALD

was so motivated during his trip to Mexico between September

27 and October 2, 1963. The paper included the allegation

that OSWALD had

an extended interview with the Cuban Ambassador

to Mexico, whom he met at a restaurant on the outskirts of

Mexico, D. F., from where they departed together in the Cuban

Ambassador's automobile for a private conversation.

LASAGA had advised the White House that he received

the above report from ANGEL FERNANDEZ VARELA, an employee of

the Voice of Cuba in Miami, Florida, who received the intor-
