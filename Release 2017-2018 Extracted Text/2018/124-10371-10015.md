our representative who met him in Miami:

A. The Partido Revolucionario del Pueblo (PRP)
has ceased to exist for all practical purposes. According

PRP falls on its leader Antonio SANTIAGO, whon |-"Jdescribes
asa "farsante." : (S)

B. Mario RIVADULLA, a member of the PRP_Ex cutive, :
Committee who now lives in Santo Domingo, told that )

. it is impossible to organize a pglitical movement in exile
which would be capable of influencing in any way the develop-  . \
ment of events in Cuba. RIVADULLA now believes that there |
is no alternative but to await.a spontaneous change of
events in Cuba and a possible: overthrow or assassination of
Castro by the military.

agencies, cae specifically the CIA, support any of

these groups, makes emphatically clear in his report
that none of the exile groups have the support of the U.S.

support. He points out that the U.S. Government not only

ignores. the political exiles, but places high priority on
its relations with the USSR and ‘is "disposed" to lift the

blqskade of Cuba and reestablish relations with Havana.

against Soviet Bloc missions in Latin America, to be put
