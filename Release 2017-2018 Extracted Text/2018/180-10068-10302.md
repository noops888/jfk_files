Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 14

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

The Honorable Henry B. Gonzalez,

Chairman,

House Select Committee on Assassinations

2312 Rayburn House Office Building

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am saddened but understanding regarding your letter of

resignation going today to House Speaker Thomas ("Tip") O'Neill

as Chairman of the Select Committee on Assassinations.

Out of my associations with you and your personal staff dur-

ing all of the days following the introduction of your original

Resolution, H. Res. 204 - to establish a Select Committee on As -

sassinations to reopen for investigation our political assassina-

tions in America -- with its accompanying long waiting periods for

its acceptance and approval, the volumes of supportive correspon-

dence handled and legislative steps taken by you and your staff,

the time and effort expended within the confines of your office and

on the House floor, your total sincerity and understandable dedi-

cation in launching your crusade -- to see such dedicated personal

effort and sacrifice sabotaged, twisted, maligned and brought to

such fruitless finality -- in complete sadness and empathy I want

you to know I

share with you in your moment of total surrender to

utter futility. For it is my absolute belief your "dream" of es-

tablishing a Select Committee and staff for the purpose of "solving"

these assassinations has

been unscrupulously distorted by others -

lacking your desire for truth and justice - to instead establishing

a Select Committee and staff deeply involved in "creating" assassi-

nations: in my opinion, Mr. Chairman, a tragedy, but more, a disgrace.

Mr. Chairman, as I wrote you at the time of

my appointment to

the

staff of the Select Committee on Assassinations, "

• . . I am

honored and proud to serve you still," -- upon your resignation, that

same honor and pride dictates my request to be immediately termina-

ted as a member of the staff of the Select Committee on Assassina-

tions.

I want to make you aware I responded to Mr. Al Lewis's letter from

with Miss Joyce Larkin and specifically asked her to take my statement

in writing, which

she said she was doing. I stated: "Please advise

Committee offices for 'assignment' today, but that will not be pos-

PERSONAL HISTORY - EDYTH H. BAISH

Supplemental Sheet

4. EMPLOYMENT RECORD (Contd.)

Those periods of time lapse that appear in my record were during times when I

was either remaining at home to care for my family's needs, or was engaged in

the performance of temporary assignments as a secretary-typist for outside

businesses and professions.

Secretarial/typing duties were performed for many

and varied individuals, businesses and professions, some herein listed:

industry, U. S. Government, motion picture distributors, business and financial

consultants, universities, advertising, insurance, and others.

*

When hired by this firm I understood that I was to work directly for an associate

of the firm in Food and Drug law who reportedly was "very difficult" to work for;

I found this to be true and reported it to the Head of the Secretarial Department.

I would have had to remain in the typing pool awaiting another secretarial opening

within the Firm. I decided I could do better elsewhere. This associate has since

been let go by the Firm, I understand.

(Mesirov, Gelman, Jaffe & Levin Law Firm - Reason for leaving: Personal).

I was hired originally as Executive Secretary to the Law Office Administrator.

Within two weeks I was promoted, with the title of Administrative Assistant, with

the promise of a pay increase within 60 days. Within that time I received another

promotion to Supervisor-Administrative Services, but no increase in salary, as

promised. When I approached him regarding his promise of raising my salary to a

figure warranted (his words) for my work responsibilities, I was given unaccept-

able reasons why this increase was not forthcoming. I came to understand my ap-

pointment in the capacity I served in the Firm was a matter of reorganization and

I took the matter to the President's (U.S.)

Price Board and was advised the LOA undoubtedly was not receiving the approval of

Management regarding the LOA's decision at reorganization. I saw

nothing to do

but resign from the Firm.

Dear Mr. Feeney:

In response to your request by telephone last evening, I

herein express my interest in serving on the Committee under the

Chairmanship of Congressman Thomas N. Downing to reopen investi-

Extensive work

with Ms. Gail Beagle, Administrative Assistant to Congressman Henry

B. Gonzalez on H. Res. 204, Congressman Gonzalez' resolution to

establish a select committee for the purpose of reopening for study

the various political assassinations, brought me in contact with

volumes of material and correspondence relative to the assassina-

tions, and on occasion I talked personally with those interested

and in support. I would consider it a high honor to participate

with those endeavoring to pursue truth and justice in this vital

matter and have made my interest known to you with the full knowl-

edge and approval of Ms. Beagle.

You may be assured of my dedication and zeal.

Respeaffully,

FILE REF.!

H4

Attached is a resume for Mrs. Edyth H. Baish, whom I

highly recommend to you for a secretarial position on

the committee staff. Mrs. Baish is a highly professional

secretary -- hardworking and competent. She has worked

or me on a parttime basis for more than four years. She

presently has her own secretarial service, but would 1ike

to forego this effort in order to concentrate on a full

time job with the committee. She is available to be in-

terviewed by you at your convenience.

Mrs. Baish and I have previously discussed her applica-

tion with Tiny and Rick.

I will be glad to talk with

you further about her, if you would like.

With warmest regards, I remain

Sincerely,

tail

Gail J. Beagle,

Administrative/Press Assistant,

U. S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez
