In addition, each of Sirhan's four brothers was

Interviewed by Special

Agents of the Los Angeles Office of

the FBI on June 13, 1968, at which time they advised Sirhan

has never left the

United States since his arrival in 1957.

They pointed out that the word Abu Khatar, meaning "is the

father of Khatar," is a term not used by Christians and that

the Sirhan family is Christian.

The Department of State has advised that it has

received no communication from any country in the Middle

East relative to the aforementioned matter. According to

the Department of State, information was received from the

American Embassy in Tel

Aviv, Israel, to the effect that

a United Press International correspondent had reportedly

talked with Sirhan's father in Jordan who stated that to

his knowledge Sirhan never married and the other details

contained in the original story of June 13, 1968, are

â€¢ highly improbable.

was made by that agency in London to contact Jon, also known

as John, Kinche with whom this story originated.

seemed umimpressed by the possibility this might be a simple

case of mistaken identity.

Agenci who apparently supports official Israelt Zonist

unscrupulous free lance journalist in

lines in his work.

that during early 1968 there were strong protests from
