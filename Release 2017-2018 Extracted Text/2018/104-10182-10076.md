Attack, to G-8190

Case #16,416-X

Age: 34

Nationality: American (former)

Sex: Male

Preliminary Survey:

Due to the inadequacy of the submitted material, only summarizing

statements can be made.

Summarizing Statements:

The writer is a very changeable and unstable person who manages

to appear fairly well controlled and equilibrated on the outside. Ee

possesses a superior intelligence and professional training of sciezrific

nature, on a racher high level. He has not only absorbed, but actually

assimilated much of the material he has read and studied, and he snows

how to utilize it in a purposeful manner. His intellectual as well as bis

practical tendencies are pronounced and developed, but except in lis

professional work, they do not always supplement each other constructively.

Either he may get too involved with the materialistic aspects of a project

without considering its more abstract and theoretical implications. or he

may get interested in some intellectual speculations without consice-ing

their practical feasibility, thus becoming rather unrealistic in his

approach.

In his work, he is well able to distinguish the essential irom

the unessencial, and he is able to think clearly and logically. He cas

exercise analyzing and synthesizing faculties, and he is quite clever

"in putting two and two together" from the things he sees and bears. He

in alert and learns and understands quickly. He possesses considerable

mental agility which enables him to understand intellectually a variety of

problems, situations and people, without having any personal emoti:cal

relationship to them. He possesses skill in expressing himself versally

as well as in writing. While he is not likely to say more than would be

absolutely necessary, he has a great facility in presenting the same acts

in various fashions, depending on the situations he finds himself in." He

can be very critical and dissecting in his approach. He has mental =de-

pendence and he can work at the blueprint or a plato manipulate meera

on a more complex and abstract level. He has understanding for michanical

and technical functioning.

While he makes effoits at being economiri, he

may not always get along with the money and material at his disposa. He

evidently takes his specialized work seriously, and he is fairly accuate

and conscientious in the execution of his tasks. When occasional

inaccuracies occur, he is quite adruit in coverung them up. The level

of his performance maj nut always be quite even and uniform, depend-

ing on his emotional fluctuations and moods. Mowever, he is rather

ambitious and likes to make a good showing. When he is interested in

a job, he can concentrate well on it. He likes unusual and challeng-

ing tasks, but he may get bored and distracted when he has to deal with

routine assignments. He has a fairly good memory for stuided material,

while he inay be somewhat forgetful in everyday life.

In emotional respects, the writer does not have one unified personality,

"but various personalities which are not properly integrated and connected.

His external sophistication covers up a considerable emotional unformed-

ness and immaturity, which is bound to come to the surface in closer per-

sonal cuntact with him. He can act a variety of roles, some of them in

a very convincing manner, in a perfectly detached and rationalized fashion.

He is highly ego-centered, and his feelings and emotions are strongly

repressed, but they may find expression in rather unadjusted ways. He

is quite dissociated from his environment, and there is hardly any

emctional participation in anything he does. He represses a considerable

number of inferiority and anxiety feelings which he tries to overcompen-

sate by a self-assured and at times even courageous appearance. He is

suffering from a number of inner tensions and cunflicts which he tries to

push aside and suppress. He is uneasy and restless, and he tres to run

away from everything and everybody,

including himself.

He is dissatis-

fied and at times even disgruntled, and he tries to find the cause for his

unpleasant moods rather in his environment, instead of within himself.

He is irritable and excitable and quite erratic and unpredictable. In pro-

fessional situations, he seems to be able to check himself, but even there he

may not always be easy to handle. He may get angry suddenly and give up

what he is doing. He can establish only superficial rationalized contacis

with others, and he lacks the capacity for establishing emotional personal

interrelationships. He is a person without roots and

substance who lacke

instinctive understanding for social demands. He is intelligent enough to

cover up his emotional deficiencies of almost psychopathic character in

general, and many people who are dealing with him may not even suspect

his underlying disturbance. As a result, they may be quite surprised when

they are confronted by some strange and peculiar actions or reactions of

his which may defy a rational explanation. There is a lot of aggression

within him which he tries to cuntrol, but which may find occasional and

somewhat distored outlets.

He is most secretive about his affairs, and he

is not likely to confide in anybody completely. Actually, he is rather

suspicious, and his self-defensive and self-protective mechanisme come

quickly into play as soon as he senses the slightest possible danger to his

vulnerable self. This does not prevent hin: from putting on a daring

air when he considers it fit for the occasion. Hia fundamental problem

is that he has not established a firm identification with a sound sociological

and ideological pattern.

He is impressionable and has a strong capacity

for identification and he seems to try out a variety of patterns as his

frame of reference, the way other people try on new cloths. There may

have been considerable instability in his childhood envirorinent which

caused this morally driltless development. Rationally, he evidently has

learned fundamental ethical principles which he ries to follow super-

ficially for appearance sake. In reality, he has an unusually great number

of camouflaging capacities which have practically become second nature

to him. He himself may frequently not realize if he is lying or telling

the truth. This is also part of his emotional disturbance. While he may

be involved in undertakings which border on the criminal, his perscnality

constellation has more of a pathological than a criminal character. His

tensiveness and complexity absorbs a great amount of his ample psycho-

physical resources. However, he has sufficient strength and energy at

present (the time when this book was written) to support his general fune-

tioning adequately. On the surface, he may convey a controlled and cou-

posed impression which may deceive over his fundamental imbalance

and unreliability.

Summasy:

The writer has well developed intellectual and practical capabilities

which should make him a competent worker in his specialized professional

field. At the same time, he is suffering from a basic emotional distur-

bance (of paranoid-schizoid character) which is superficially controlled,

but which undermines his ethical integrity, prevents a satisfactory social

adjustment and possibly intermittently affects his professional performance.

Qualification:

This report must be evaluated as qualified information, because the

handwriting standarda submitted for analysis are not adequate.
