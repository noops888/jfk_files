SUBJECT : Review of Selected Items in the
Lee Harvey OSWALD File Regarding Allega-
tions of CASTRO Cuban Involvement in the
John F, KENNEDY Assassination’

REFERENCE : Letter by David W. Belin to
Mr. £, Henry Knoche, 15 April 1975,
paragraph 3 (Regarding Public Statement
by CASTRO, etc.}), attached

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963, .
Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in
Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal
interview by the Associated Press correspondent,
Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,
8 September, and was in print throughout the country on
Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the
facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been
expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this
event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of
topics but dealt principally with American political
leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinarily provocative fashion

("\... KENNEDY is a cretin;"" ... the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

"Ye

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

all time

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the
New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that
CASTRO's “message” was significantly modulated.

S. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) ~ Prime Minister
Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.
leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba. '

"Bitterly denouncing what he ‘called
recent U.S. prompted raids on Cuban terri-
tory, Castro said: ‘We are prepared to
fight them and answer in kind. U.S. leaders”
should think that if they are aiding terror-
ist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, they
themselves will not be safe.’

* .,.,. World affairs ... seemed to be
entering a more peaceful climate a few days
ago, but now this trend has changed with
attacks.

"'The U.S. is always ready to negotiate
and make promises which later it will not honor.
This has happened to promises made during the
October crisis. They have been broken as can
be seen with new attacks.

"'But I warn this is leading to a very
dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...
6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,
used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference
to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real
significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-
write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C,, printed the HARKER
story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the
paper (9 September 1963, page B-4) and reworded the content
of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-
litical aspects - in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER
elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States
leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY
assassination that this CASTRO interview was considered in
following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission
and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed
Headquarters attention to the AP story very shortly after
the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears
to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-~
eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence
in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission
staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview
in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no
evidence in the files that anything along these lines was
stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's
request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the
assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

of the review, admittedly heavily using the 20 - 20 quality
of hindsight, may be stipulated in summary:

a. There is no increment of credible
evidence, applying this phrase strictly, of
Soviet and/or Cuban political, intelligence
or security service involvement in the as~
sassination to what was developed and con-
sidered by the Warren Commission and its
staff. The Commission's finding that
Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of
President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and did
them in alone and of his own determination
stands.

b. "Credible evidence" that would

upset or significantly modify this judgement
did (and does) not exist in Washington. But
such evidence could exist in Moscow and/or
Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the Warren
Commission were minimal in quantity and
quality, designed to cover up any admissions
of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD

. which might be related directly or indirectly
with the assassination. Therefore, the belief
that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB and/or
PGI) connection with OSWALD will persist and

grow until there has been a full disclosure
by these governments of all elements, of
OSWALD's handling and stay in the Soviet Union
and his contacts in Mexico City. The

Warren Commission report should have left a
wider "window" for this contingency. That,
indeed, was the opinion at the working level,
particularly in the counterintelligence com-
ponent in the CIA in 1964. As was indicated
by Mr. Helms in his testimony before the
Warren Commission, CIA would continue to
regard this aspect of the OSWALD case as
still open. .

c. In the absence of additional or new
elements of "credible" evidence, there are
"nuances" in the record that emerge as note-
worthy, in the light of other conclusions.
These are reviewed and summarized below, item~
by-item.

great significance in the light of the

pathological evolution of OSWALD's passive/

aggressive makeup after his attempt to kill

General WALKER early in April 1963 and his

identification with Fidel CASTRO and the

Cuban revolution which is directly trace-

able as far back as his Marine Corps

service in El Toro, California. CASTRO's

warning and threat, given to AP corres~

pondent HARKER, irrespective of whether

there was any formal mandate, or even

security service contact with OSWALD

by the Cubans or the Russians - was an act

of singular irresponsibility and under no

circumstances was excusable as retorsion

9. The testimony of Nelson DELGADO contains an assertion
of germinal significance to any review of the background of
Lee Harvey OSWALD's feeling toward and relations with

CASTRO's Cuba. DELGADO was probably the closest peer group

member to OSWALD during his specialist training period
at El Toro Marine Corps Base December 1958 - September 1959.
The Warren Commission Report takes note of this:

"OSWALD told DELGADO that he was in

touch with Cuban diplomatic officials in’

this country, which DELGADO at first took

to be 'one of his lies, but later

believed. '"2

16. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of
possible operational significance than is reflected by the
language of the report, and its implications do not appear
to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,
the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with
the Cubans starts with a question mark.

ll. he period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban
relations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at
the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu-
larly keen about how to get to the island. DELGADO testi-
fied:

accelerated his exit on grounds of family hardship in early
September 1959. On 27 September 1969 he was issued a

U.S. passport valid for travel - among other places to
Cuba and the USSR. He entered the Soviet Union from
Finland on 15 October 1959.

13. DELGADO's testimony has the cast of credibility.
Granting that, it is of basic’importance to focus attention
on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp
and talked with him for between one and a half to two hours.
The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually
there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else
we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before
or after his return to the United States. The record reflects
no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presunp-
tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.
Assuming that, the questions are: Who was it, and was
there reporting from Los Angeles to Washington and Havana
that could, in effect, represent the opening of a Cuban

Morse BENITEZ Zabola, said that the Communist Party in
Guatamala should form a single new party; “We need not
preoccupy ourselves over the politics of President KENNEDY
because we know, according to prognostications, that he
will die within the present year, 1962."

15. This report apparently had been discounted when
it was received and was not forwarded until the'Station
re-reviewed all of its material after the assassination.
The file reflects no follow-up ox formal dissemination
of the report.

concluding with the admonition: " ... Just wait and you

be more specific what would happen soon, SANTOS replied:
“Just wait, just wait."

from The Hague reportedly for reasons related to that fact

in April 1966.

INTERCEPTED CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE,
LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18. At 1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the
KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named
“Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-
tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest |
news. "Laisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew
it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and
now, that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians! ..."

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the
assassination. "Luisa" also stated that the party at
Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear
that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would
they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she
‘said she planned to move that night into the house of a
doctor (a woman) friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion
of foreknowledge? This is the only item in the intercept
coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation.

SECRET

22, The tenuous, enignmatic character of the conversation
is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

a. "Luisa" was probably identical with
Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban
Directorate General of Intelligence {(DGT).

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported
to be working in DGI Headquarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the
fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz
who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally
as the replacement of the Consul Busebio AZCUE
(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI
chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL's successor)
was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

c. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's
conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican
national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known
visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban
installations in connection with a Cuban visa
application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the
record regarding OSWALD's activity in
Mexico City. . Her testimony, however, in its
entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the
Mexican Governmental authorities. A direct

confrontation with her was requested by the
Warren Commission staff but rejected by the
Mexican authorities. It is from Silvia DURAN'S
statements that it was learned that OSWALD
became engaged in a personal altercation on
27 Septenber with Eusebio AZCUE,
d. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,
alias Marcos, and his DGI assistant,
Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively
identified in February 1964 by two independent
sources as engaged in the active development
and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan
agents for the purpose of assassinating
General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, it is estab-
lished, was on post in Mexico City during
OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October
1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963
for Havana. It was reliably reported about
VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally
or illegally, had to pass through him first. He
took the biegraphical data and sent it to Cuba
for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days.

For example, VEGA would have handled the details of the
visa‘action and facilitation of the trip to Cuba via

Mexico City from 28 December 1962 ~ 21 January 1963 that

SILVIA DURAN, SUBSTANTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ADMISSION OF
ALLEGED PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD, 1967

24. The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia DURAN

testimony already have been suggested above. (In that

context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider
the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations
on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,
and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquim Hernandez ARMAS,
because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-
tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about [or been
offered?] money payments by her Mexican interrogators.)

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her
Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN
was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have
cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967, of
how she had been taken into custody and had been interrogated
after the assassination repeated what was already known.
She added, under circumstances that did not permit the
source to challenge or elicit corroborative detail, that

dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial contact between

hundreds of CIA man-hours in Headquarters and abroad ~

Mexico city. ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the
use of the polygraph, on which ALVARADO showed evidences of
deception, and by bringing ALVARADO'’s former Nicaraguan
security service control into the case.

28. The ALVARADO story is a particularly acute repre-
sentation of the difficulties that beset the evaluation of
observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist
despite the impeachment of its major premises. LVARADO,
whose account did not become public until the release of
the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of
the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro
with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena GARRO de Paz is a mecurial, articulate and
socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated
from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She
is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN, the husband of
Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal
antipathy between the two women descending from
Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communism.

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall
of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently
kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO'S

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the
Cubans ané in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963
including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in
a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964:
“Elena GARRO [said] that she and her

daughter were invited to a party at the Cuban

Embassy during the period she now finds out

that OSWALD was here in Mexico prior tothe
assassination. She was invited by a Mexican
secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

is a cousin of the GARRO family [Horacio DURAN}.

At the party she saw three Gringos, not

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing around together like three bumps on a

log. They were so obviously out of place that

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was, told that 'they were just passing
threugh.' She claims that on the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was
spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos ‘without a doubt' at the

party."

32. GARRO repeated her story to Mr. Charles William

THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on 10 December 1965:

In September 1963 after her return from abroad, she went
to a party, accompanied by her daughter, at the home of
Ruben DURAN [emphasis added]. Ruben is one of the two
brothers of Horacio DURAN, who married her cousin. She
met OSWALD and two other young Americans. At the party
she was discouraged from talking with him. Other guests
were the Cuban Consul AZCUE, General Clark FLORES,

Silvia DURAN, who she later learned was OSWALD's mistress
while he was here, Emilio CARBALLIDO and a Latin American

Negro man with red hair [emphasis added]. In November 1963

when the identity of the assassin became known, she and
her daughter went to the Cuban Embassy and shouted
"assassins" and other insults at the staff there. ® Shortly
afterward, she and her daughter were visited by a friend,
Manuel CARVILLO [or CALVILLO], then an official in the
Secretariat of the Gobernacion and were told he had orders
to escort them to a small and obscure hotel in the center
of town. They were kept there for eight days under pretext
that they were in danger. When she told CARVILLO she wanted
to go to the American Embassy and explain what she knew of
OSWALD, she was told that the American Embassy was full of
Communist spies.

33. On 25 December 1965 and 9 January 1966 in further

interviews with THOMAS, GARRO and her daughter elaborated and

in certain particulars significantly modified her earlier
account. She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been interviewed by Embassy officers to whom she claimed
they did not give a very complete story because the

Embassy officers did not appear to give much credence to
anything they said.

34. %It developed that GARRO and daughter had been
interviewed by the Legal Attache on 17 and 24 November 1964.
Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her
account to THOMAS but had not been substantiated by inquiries.
The FBI representative therefore considered the matter closed
and reaffirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA
Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador
on 25 February 1965.

35. The Embassy Political Officer, however, persisted in
his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of .conversation,
13 July 1966, GARRO identified the place to which she had been
taken by CALVILLO as the Hotel Vermont. (This detail checked
out affirmatively, GARRO was at the Hotel 23 - 24, 25 - 27
and 28 - 30 November 1963.) In another, on 7 February 1967,
GARRO's continuing vicissitudes with the cubans are set out.
And finally, upon THOMAS's retirement from U.S. Government
service, the Department of State, at his request,

28 August 1969, disseminated to CIA and FBI a compilation of
his reporting of the Elena GARRO interviews.

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the
events she described as having occurred in the Mexican capital
in September 1963 never coincided with the confirmed data
of OSWALD's presence there. Her story, however, had two
points congruant with allegations by others regarding
OSWALD:

a. ALVARADO's allegations regarding the
Negro with the red-dyed hair [this detail could,
however, have been gleaned from the

Warren Commission's published account of the

"D" case] and
b. Silvia DURAN's later claim of
intimate personal contacts with OSWALD.

37. Beginning in March and amplified in May 1967,. the
American Consul, Benjamin J. RUYLE, in Tampico developed a
contact with a local Mexican journalist,

Oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered
OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the
University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38.° In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA
officer:

He studied law at the University of Mexico
for three years, approximately 1960 - 1964. He
belonged to a clandestine Pro-CASTRO revolutionary
group at the University, Regarding the OSWALD

case he was extremely cautious and although he

was not able or willing to give dates and

names, he said OSWALD visited the University

of Mexico campus shortly after the Cuban

Embassy refused him a visa to visit Cuba.

OSWALD made inguiries regarding pro-Cuban

revolutionary groups at the University and

was directed to CONTRERAS and his friend.

OSWALD met CONTRERAS and four other persons

_ as they came out of a round-table discussion

held in the faculty of Philosophy. OSWALD

told the group it was urgent that he visit

Cuba and the Cuban Embassy had denied him a

visa. He requested aid from CONTRERAS' group.

CONTRERAS and others mistrusted OSWALD because

they felt he was a CIA provocation. The group

allowed OSWALD to accompany them the rest of the

day, that night and part of the next day. OSWALD

was very introverted and appeared to be slightly

crazy. OSWALD made no mention of an assassination

plot but kept bringing up the point he had to

travel to Cuba immediately.

39. At this point, with FBI knowledge, the matter was
turned over to the Mexican authorities who determined that
CONTRERAS was indeed at the University of Mexico but only

for the years 1959 - 1960 and that he had been publicly

associated in protest activity for the Student Revolutionary

Bloc (BER) in January 196i. However, the group ceased

functioning as such in the middle of 1962, and

Oscar CONTRERAS was never one of its leaders. Wo further

work is reflected in the files on the CONTRERAS allegations,
Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about
his own presence at the University, there is an additional
element that undermines the credibility of his account:
OSWALD's ‘Spanish, which was barely adequate to get him meals
near the hotel, seems hardly likely to have permitted him to

carry on for an extended period with a University student

group.
