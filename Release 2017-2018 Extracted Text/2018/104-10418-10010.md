MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Rockefeller Commission Contact

Mason Cargill told me today that the reference
in the Commission report to an employee who was fired
because he abused a defector came from a deposition by
Dick Helms. Helms could not. remember an exact name,
but from the description which he gave on his deposition,
it is clear that the employee who was fired was John
Torpats. He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960.

Torpats, himself a Lithuanian’ tefugee, was working
in thi in Frankfort,) Germany.
‘ In the course of interrogating another Lithuafiian
defector, Torpats beat him. After Torpats was fired,
he sued the Director (then McCone). He lost the case.
