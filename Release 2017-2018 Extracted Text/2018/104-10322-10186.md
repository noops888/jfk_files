TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND MR, RANKIN, GENERAL
COUNSEL OF COMMITTEE ON THE ASSASSINATION

12 May 1964

2:50 PM returned DCI's call

DCI:

if you'd be so good as to appear personally before the Commission
and testify very briefly.

Yes, I'll do that,

Now, all they want to deal with is the question of your knowledge
about Oswald being an agent or informer or any thing of that
character, They also would like to deal with your knowledge of
any conspiracy, either domestic or foreign and that kind of thing.
We are going to have Edgar Hoover on Thursday at nine to deal
pretty much with the same thing. I think we might also ask,

Mr, McCone, a little bit about the question of security precautions
for the President that you might suggest in a very general way,
things that might have occurred to you. I1;m sure you know the
President is very sensitive about that area for himself, That is,
he thinks that sometimes it's just an interference with things he'd
like to do,

Well, all Presidents think that. President Eisenhower used to
complain about that all the time and so did Kennedy.

And since this testimony is all going to be made public, I thought
you might want to keep that in mind, You will have some thoughts
about possibly in the domestic area or in the foreign are a or both,
in that regard, that they would like to have from you,

Alright, I'd be glad to come up.

Would 10:30 or 11:00 on Thursday be at all convenient,

Sure, that's be fine.

Which would you prefer?

Well, I'd prefer 10:30, I have a 12:30 luncheon, You have Mr,
Hoover at 9:00/

I think that we should be well out of the way by then,

Well, suppose I come up at 10:30 and if you run over, well, I can
just wait, ~

Fine.
Where is this, Mr. Rankin?

200 Maryland Avenue, NE and it's cater-cornered from the
Supreme Court Building, it's the Veteran's Foreign War
Building on the fourth floor, It's a white marble building. ..

I'l find it.

Ig you have any questions about anything that occurred to you
beforehand and you want to ask me, don't hesitate to call me.

Should I come alone or do you want me to bring somebody with
me?

Whatever your pleasure.
I see.
It makes no difference as far as the Commission...

I'll tell you what I'll do. Iwill bring with me the man that's
been principally involved in answering any questions that you've
had, I know you've had some.

And if something occurs to you why we'll just let ;you go off the
record and ask him if there's something that ;you don't feel that
you could answer yourself and you want to get a little refreshing
from him,

Alright, fine. I'll be there. Tell me, how are you getting along
with this Buchannan matter?

Well, we've been debating that over here and we're quite unhappy
with that fellow. I got a note today saying that in the preface to
his London edition he says that he talked w this over with someone
in the Co. mmission and that the entire text of his report ix has
been filed in Washington with the Commission, He's apparently
trying to give some respectability to itin that way. Some of the
%& Commission think that we should call him, some think that it
would just advertise him if we do.

I realize that, and you're always up against that problem of
dignifying a book or report; however, Iwas rather distrubed at
a discussion I had a week ago with Mrs. Fluer Cowles Meyer
lives in London, and; you knew her as Fluer Cowles when she
was married to Mike Cowles and she told me of the extent to



13-00000

DCI:

DCI:

DCI:

which Buchannan had captured the radio and television audiences
in Great Briton and on the continent and went so far as to say that
unless the Commission's report dealt with his allegations and
charges with a good deal of finality, there would be quite a feeling
that the report itself was a whitewash and that the real facts had
not been developed,

Well, we had in mind to take every point that he raised, and Mark
Lane and every other person that's commented that way in a separate
section and just proceed to knock everyone of them clear out.

That might do it. I spoke to the Chief Justice about'it. The fact
is I think he talked to Fluer about it,

He's one of the strongest against calling him. Did he indicate
that to you?

Yes, he indicated that to me, and for the reason that he was itx
afraid that it would just advertise him. I know that, because I

get up against that with every book or article that's written criticizing
the Central Intelligence Agency. I have a certain number of people
who want you to get right on the stump and deny it and when you
analyze it, all you've done is advertise what has been said,

~ Right.

But nevertheless, I think your position is considerably different
than the one I mentioned,

You think about it, whether you think that if we dress ourselves
directly to it in a separate section of the report with all of these
claims made by people like that, whether you think that might
be better than to try to call him here and just have him put on

a show. I think they might like an off the record comment from
you if you'd care to make one.

I'll give some thought about it between now and Thursday. Alright
fine. Thank you.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN

11:20 a.m. - 4 May 1964

DCI: I am calling you because last night we had a guest for dinner,
a mutual friend yours and mine, by the name of{Fleur Cowles .
Montague-Meyers. |

Ww: Whom I know very well.

DCI: Now, she engaged me in a conversation at dinner concerning

this Buchanan report and she was very disturbed about it because
of the very great impact that she feels it is having in England
and throughout Europe. Buchanan has been on TV and on radio,
both in Britain and on the continent.

Ww: And he has got a hook coming out on the 8th.

DCI: And he has yot a book coming out and she feels that essential
in your report that you dispose of his allegations or indigate
the errors on which he draws his conclusions. She feels so
strongly that she told me that if this were not done, there would
be a very strong feeling among groups in Europe that this whole
investigation was a whitewash and that we didn't get to the bottom
of the thing. Now, strangely enough, there was an article that
appeared in the Washington Post on Saturday, which you undoubtedly

read. eee a
Ww: Is that the one by John Henshaw?
DCI: No, the one by Chalmers Roberts. Z
WwW: I didn't see the Roberts one, but I have one by Henshaw - I'm

just reading it right now. Ihave it before me. Ithought that was
probably what you were calling me about. It is from the Inquirer.

DCI: Yes, I have seen that, but that is a kind of sensational thing.
Chalmers Roberts, ask your girl to get....

W: : Let's see, that wasn't in the News. That was in the Post.
DCI: Yes, it was in the Post.
WwW: Yes, lread Roberts. Saturday morning, I read that, saying that

he thought we ought to go into all of these things.

DCI: Now, (Fieuz|is in town today. She is leaving this evening. She
would like very much and it might be wofth your time if she could
drop in and just give you, herself, what she told me last night.

I don't know whether you would want to do that.

Well, I know Fleur) Would like to talk to her. I usually see
her when she is here. Iam a little surprise that she would
doubt that we wouldn't do such a thing. :
Well, you know, sometimes these girls get quite steamed up
about things.

We have taken closer to 400 than 300 witnesses' testimony
and we have taken it deliberately so that nobody can say that
we have just been rubber stamped for the Secret Service or
the FBI or anybody else.

Well, I told her in great detail at dinner because you had told
me only a few days ago, the depth and the penetration of your
inquiry.

We haven't yet finished and I would think, John, between you
and me, that we ought to take this book of Buchanan when it
comes out and scrutinize it carefully to see that there is nothing
that we have overlooked. Because if he has any allegations in
there concerning witnesses who have information we ought to
hear them and we will do that. I don't - I hesitate calling him
to testify because that might be just what he is looking for to
get the sounding board for another book and I don't want to do.
that.

Well, you have to be careful about that until you at least see
the book. Now, I thought this Chalmers article was very strange
coming (1) by Chalmers Roberts and (2) in the Washington Post.

It sounded so to me.

However, it is interesting that Buchanan worked for the Washington
Post in 1949.

Wasn't it the Star?

No, Iam told he worked for the Post, Now, I may be wrong on that.

Well, I just saw in one of the papers the other day he was originally
a Star reporter here. He could have been either.

Could have been either and sometimes those fellows shift from one
newspaper to the other.

This is nit not the kind of thing Chalmers usually indulges in.

No, it was entirely foreign to his - to areas that are normal |
to him.

The thing that I didn't like about it, he rather intimated that
this came from some source within the Commission.

I didn't read that into it. But you would be more alert to that
than I. Well, in any event what shall I do?

corde
Well, I'll be glad to see Fleur and talk to her.

I'll have her call you up.

Yes, ybu may tell her .as far as this is concerned, we have no
intention of letting go uninvestigated any phase of it any of these
people have brought up.

Well, it is always pbeasant to see her anyway, you know.
It is always. pleasant to see her and I'll be glad to see her.

She is going to call me in a little while and I'll tell her to give
you a ring.

Fine. Say, John, in this one about - of Henshaw's. Let me see
if I can find it quickly here - he alleges that the Central Intelligence
Agency was using Ruby to recruit commandos for raids against
Castro's Cuba. To prevent this explosive information from being
disclosed, the CIA asked the Justice Dept. to step in and stop the
Dallas police from arresting Ruby as wellas Oswald. This was
supposed to be last April and then it says, a top secret document
a letter signed by a high official of the Justice Dept. was sent in
April 1963 from the Justice Dept. to the Dallas Chief of Police,
Jesse E. Curry requesting theDalas police not to arrest Oswald
and Ruby in connection with the attempted slaying of Gen. Walker.

There is no truthin that. Let me get you all the dppe on that,

Oh, I'm just positive there is no trugh init. The only thing is I'm
trying to find a way where we can counteract any such thing

because that paraded over Europe and around the world is a terrible
thing. Do you know anything about this so-called Inquirer? ,

I don't know from where it came. In fact I didn't see that article
until iast night when Fleur was leaving, I sent out to try to find
the Chalmers article and they came back with this Inquirer article.
But that is the first time I had seenit. I guess it came out in

one of the Sunday papers.

Yes.

We get the Star, Times, Herald-Tribune and the Post, so it was
one of those four. :

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J, EDGAR HOOVER

DCI:

DCI:

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CIA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly
expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.
We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to
make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various
wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man etc, that firedthe gun. But there is no question
that he is the right man, There are a lot of aspects that we have
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.
We have now found that the photograph that was taken was not
that of Oswald. We do find from our informant down there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him
the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wald take three
weeks, He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States,

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have
those operational sources down there. We want to handle them
very carefully, It involves Some very high level people/down
there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times,

Katz hock : Bite
Mr, Katzenbach \who is handling it for the Department -

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will
of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report
that will be released to the public, probably through the White

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned
in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that
has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc.
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned, It is his
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be
sure that whatever is said in the report is conférred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will
have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said
and I know he will-welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

Well that will be fine. Thank you

Good bye.

27 November 1963 - 10:25 a.m,

DCI:

IT have a little problem here which I think you can help with. A professor
of Russian history who has spent many years studying the details of

the Rusian Secret Police is convinced in his own mind, based ona

study of their methods and other developments, that the assassination

of President Kennedy was engineered by the Police. Now, he is so
convinced of his being right that if he doesn't do anything else he would
like to, give a public lecture on this theory andI am just a little afraid
that in the emotional environment at the moment, that this might be

given more attention by the public than it may deserve. I have persuaded
him at least to wait until the evidence which President Johnson has
insisted be developed and be given to the American public, so at least

he could weigh this against that. But he wants to get it off his conscience

“ and what I am wondering is this: Do you have a couple of knowledgeable

subordinates who wbuld be willing to take the time let him come over
and simply state his thesis in order to relieve his conscience and
perhaps in this way he will give up doing anything else. I don't know
how important this is.

Well, I think it is very important because the unfortunate slaying of
‘Oswald removes any. opportunity to establish from direct testimony
the possibility of any such international plot and I am being beset by
communications from all parts of the world by people feeling they know
of an assassination plot by the KGB or more frequently assassination
plots by Cuba of which Oswald was merely the trigger man. And of
course investigation of those is a very important part of this study the
FBI is making which we are supporting in every possible way. Now

I think it would be extremely useful to talk to this man. We have men
who are students of this particular area of activity and if you would
give me his name..

It is Professor Robert Slusser. Professor of Russian history. He is
more than a historian. He worked with Mosky at Columbia for some
years where a deep study of the Russian Secret Police was made. He
has also had foreign experience, but mainly what I want to give him
an opportunity to do is to talk to a couple of knowledgeable people
in absolute confidence hoping that this will satisfy him and not lead

to his making public statements.

How dol reach him?

I think the best thing to do -- 1 could give you his telephone number but
I think the best thing to do is if you can set up an appointment with someone

DCI:

I called you either on Thursday or Friday to tell you of this matter

that had been developing in Mexico City in connection with a fellow --
Nicaraguan -- presumably had some information and reported to us

he had some information on Oswald having received some money in the
Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. This (fellow) was greatly disturbed, --
we went into it in great detail with the Mexican authorities and with the
Nicaraguan Foreign Intelligence Service. Finally it blew up because
this fellow finally signed a statement on Sunday that everything he said

i
i

be

was a falsehood and he was misrepresenting because he was trying to win favor,

in some future oe Phmew bette us. But it was a matter of great concern

for a few days and I knew, énator Saltonstall's call you were worried

about things like that and I wanted to keep you fully advised.
Thank you very much. When did it clear up?

Cleared up yesterday afternoon -- about noontime-- but it was thoroughly
run down and we think disposed of.

But he had been down in the Cuban Embassy hadn't he?

Yes he had been down in Mexico City seeking a passport and travel papers
to go to Havana and from Havana to Moscow. These were refused but

he spent from September 26th to October 3rd in Mexico City during which
time he had a number of contacts with both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies
but our information which is from extremely sensitive sources indicates
he was there in the interest of getting travel rights. What I think he hoped
was he could escape quickly from Dallas and follow that course.

Wonder where he expected to get the money?

I don't know. We gave him $450 to bring him back from Russia.

And they say he paid that back.

That is what I understand.

Well, I have just raised hell about bringing back everyone of these fellows
who went off and renounced their citizenship. I have fought and fought it.



13-00000

I have complained to the President, and to the Secretary of State. I

have done it for the last-4 or 5 years, even while Eisenhower was President.

It is a disgrace to pay their way back here when (.....) on this country.
Let them stew in their own juice as far as I am concerned.

DCI: Well...

R: Well, thanks for calling.

DCI: Allright, fine, and if anything along this line develops -- delighted you
are serving on that committee. That will be a very important thing.

R: lam certainly not delighted. I really think the President took unfair
advantage of me. He called me and talked to me about going on that
committee, who he could get on there and I didn't think any of the
Supreme Court judges would serve and I told him I didn't think they
should, so he said, well, they had to have a judge. I said well get
Madina (phonetic) or somebody like that and the next thing I knew he
called me and said here is the committee I just announced to the press
and he had me on there and there wasn't anyway in the worldI could
get out of it then. I haven't got time to do it in the first place and not of
the disposition and I just don't like Chief Justice Warren either.

DCI: Well, Iam afraid you are on the committee anyway.

R: 1 just can't figure how to get out of it now.

DCI: Well, I'll keep you posted.

the President the statements of President Kennedy on September 5th, H
September 13th, and November 20th, 1962 and then I showed the evidence :
that proved absolutely that arms had been imported into Venezuela from
Cuba. I stated that most positive efforts should be made immediately
to secure complete OAS agreement on a course of action which would
involve a series of steps ranging from economic denial through blockade
and even to possible invasion, but that it must be OAS action, otherwise
it would involve confrontation with Khrushchev. I stated that if the
action was a Hemispheric action I didn't see that the USSR could do
much about it. The President agreed but decided to await the policy
meeting on Monday.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with The President - 25 November and 26 November

1. On Monday, November 25th, theré’was no briefing of the President,
although there was a short visit with him at the State reception on Monday
evening. The President then expressed regret that events of the day
prevented a briefing and asked if there was any development requiring his
attention. I replied there was none and would call him if any developments
came to my attention.

2. On Tuesday, the 26th, I briefed the President, reviewing all
items on the Check List and the world reaction summary contained in the
Bulletin. Briefing and discussion on other matters consumed about
15 or 20 minutes.

3. The President asked if our entire applicable resources had been
made available to the FBI in connection with their report, which he had
ordered. I replied affirmatively.

NOTE: I should call J. Edgar Hoover concerning this.
(DCI did this at 11:20 on 11/26/63)

4. The President asked my appraisal of the situation in Vietnam,
I replied that I was less optimistic than was the report received from
Ambassador Lodge.

5. Mr. Bundy stated the first order of business was to assist
State and assign a Deputy Chief of Mission capable of running the Country
Team and the American official community. Bundy recommended
Mr. Sullivan, Harriman's deputy. The President plans to have a man in
position not later than January first.

6. McCone stated that there remained a number of individuals in
Saigon who continued to be troublemakers and should be removed.
Bundy confirmed this and stated actions were to be taken. No names
were mentioned,

NOTE: Apparently the President's appointment
secretary will be a Mr. Moyrs. We
should get to know him,

7. The President noted with some considerable contempt the
fact that certain people in the Department of Justice had suggested
to him on Saturday that an independent investigation of the President's
assassination should be conducted by a high level group of attorneys
and jurists, probably headed by Governor Dewey. President Johnson
rejected this idea, and then heard that the identical plan was to be
advanced in a lead editorial in the Washington Post. The President
felt this was a deliberate plant and he was exceedingly critical. He
personally intervened, but failed with Mr. Al Friendly and finally
"killed" the editorial with Mrs, Graham.

mately 15 minutes.

~ - 1. The President entered Mr. Bundy's office alone and
no one was present during the conversation.

2. The President opened the conversation by recalling a i
long background of association and friendship with me personally, I
his respect for the Agency, the fact that on a number of issues i
that had arisen since I took office as DCI he and I had seen eye
to eye, he had complete confidence in me and expressed the wish |
that I continue in the future exactly as I have in the past. |

= 3. Iconfirmed my confidence in him, my desire to help and H
support him in every way and my willingness to continue inthe E
future as I have in recent months. i

4. The President then asked of any world developments. I i
reviewed details of the Checklist with him and explained the institution
of the "President's Checklist" with which he was not familiar. I i
stated that we would continue the publication of the Checklist in the
future as we had in the past. i

5. It was agreed that for the next few days I would brief the
President in the morning personally and that senior staff officers
would brief the President's staff each morning as I have in the past.
The President asked that any matters of urgent importance be brought
to his attention at any time, day or night. He designated no inter-
mediary.

6.. At 12:30 I went to the President's office in the Executive
Office Building to tell him of the information received from Mexico
City. In attendance was Mr. Bundy. Following this I had a brief
exchange with President Eisenhower who was visiting with President
Johnson at the time.

7. This evening I called Secretary Rusk and reviewed with
him the information received from Mexico City, most particularly
the holding of a Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy by
Mexican officials for interrogation concerning Lee Oswald. I
explained to Rusk the information that we had transmitted to the
FBI and to the authorities in Dallas. Rusk had not known of these
developments prior to my communication with him.

8. I offered the assistance on the part of Mrs. McCone and
me personally and also the Agency in connection with the appropriate
handling of official visitors arriving from all over the world who
might overwhelm the State Department's capacity. Rusk appreciated
this offer and said he would call on me. He further said that there
may be visitors we would like to meet with and, if so, he would make
appropriate arrangements. He indicated that he intended to avoid
having all incoming visitors appear as guests of the United States.
Each had their own embassy to take care of them, however, he

- thought there might be some obligations in which I could be helpful.

He said that following the Arlington service on Monday afternoon

he would hold a reception in the Department which would be .in the -
form of some kind of a buffet and this. would be the extent of any
planned activities. He thought it was quite probable that the President
would meet with several Heads of States at various times on Tuesday
and Wednesday. :

Dear Mr, Dulles, Unf

Herewith some materials in loose sheet form on Trotskyis:
and, in particular, Trotskyites in the U.S.

Of particular interest, I think, you will find the paper on
the differences between Trotskyism and the Communist move-
ment headed by the CP of the Soviet Union, This paper makes
eminent and clear the element of organized -indiscipline which
bas characterized the Trotskyite movement from its origins,

The paper also makes clear that there are two Trotskyite
factions in the U.S, Whereas both hold to the Trotskyite theory
of permanent revolution, they differ in their attitudes toward
‘the Soviet Union and the ruling group in the Soviet Union, The
larger -- call it the orthodox faction ~- is the Socialist Workers!
Party, headed originally by Cannon and now by Dobbs, The :

oe Militant is its weekly organ. It was with this’ group that

oe Oswald was in contact. The key element of the Socialist Workers!
Party belief, apart from permanent revolution, .is support for
the Soviet Union -~ if and when the chips aré down, 7

Information of a summary character on the Socialist

Workers! Party and the Militant is also included in this

collection, For convenience and comparison the materialp

bearing on Oswald's correspondence and views has been

reproduced and is included herewith,

erable number of organizations which are under Communist control
and which are very obviously promoting Communist objectives,
although they have not been officially. cited as Communist fronts.
For obvious reasons, the publications of these groups—though they
unquestionably fall into the category of Communist literature—
have not been considered in this tabulation. e

Publications of Communist splinter groups, too, have not been
considered thus far. “Although they have separated themselves from
the main Communist Party and disagrea with it on some tactical
points, these groups and their publications must be considered in any
estimate of Communist strength in the United States. Like the
main Communist Party, they are completely dedicated to the princi-
ples of Marxism-Leninism and, as. wil lemonstrated later in this
chapter, the main Communist Party, through united-front tactics,
has succeeded in winning the support and cooperation of these smaller

( “TAL RESORT v THE YEAR 1961 a 5

Communist. organizations in promoting Soviet. objectives in. the.

United States. (See section beginniag on p. 40.)

Ono of these groups, the Socialist Workers (Trotskyist, Communist)
Party has been cited as Communist and subversive by the Attorney
General of the-United States. Its official newspapér, The Militant,
reported an average paid circulation. of almost 5,000 for the 12 months
preceding October 1961.. The Young Socialist Alliance, a Trotskyist

youth group, has an official organ, Young Socialist, also wit! al

_. claimed circulation of 5,000.

The Marzist-Leninist Vanguard, Workers World, and Turning Point
are some of the other publications which avowedly represent additions!
Communist splinter groups ia this country. 7

‘Though the total tion of the publications of all these splinter
groups is not great, the fact remains that even a small number of
persons who operate on Marxist-Leninist conspiratorial principles are
@ very real danger. There may be only some thousands o! people
who'read_and agree with~ the -oflicial. publication: of the Socialist
Workers Party (which is more openly violent and subversive than
the main Communist Party) zt allied with the orthodox Commu-
nists of this country and their fellow travelers, they obviously intensify
the ‘very real internal danger posed by the latter:

Finally, a considerable number of magazines designed primarily for
readership in academic circles—and with definite Marxist and pro-
Communist orientation—have sprung. up within the last year or so.

No.exaet figures on Communist strength can be deduced from the
combined readership of all- these Communist and pro-Communist
publications. ‘One fact, however, does stand out beyond contradic-
tion when their probable readership fi are totaled. It is that
the Communist movement in the United States must have a following
far greater than 10,000 people-—and much greater than most Americans
realize,

Circoxation INGREASES.

Moreover, there are indications that, at the prasens time, the dis-
tribution aud readership of the type of Communist literature under
consideration is increasing rather than decreasing. :

Circulation of the official Communist Party newspaper, The Worker,
has risen steadily since 1957. A drive was begun in 1961 to increase
its subscribers to 20,000. Paid circulation of the party’s West Coast
newspaper, the People’s. World, increased by almost 1,000 in 1961.

Just wanted to check. Iwas down here today and I may have to
come down tomorrow, I don't know yet. Iwas sorry 1 wasn't here
when you were taking testimony, but Il was down in Dallas. Went
on Don Smith's show and I was going to check around, but you have
a reception this afternoon. The next time I come down I'll check
in with you. I didn't have anything particularly on my mind, but

I wanted to compare a few notes.

Well, I have got some things I want to talk to you about, so will
you let me Imow the next time you come down?

Yes, the next time I come down, I'll give you a little more notice
so we can be sure to get together.

We might have lunch or dinner or something like that.
That is what I have in mind.

O.K. - Have you seen that Buchanan book?

Yes, I have.

I have several copies of it. I sent two or three copies over and then
I got 2 more copies today and sent sent over there.

Sent over here? There is a new one out by Gunn.
Yes, I haven't seen it.

That is in French, Talks about being translated from the English,
but I can't find the English copy of it.

I'll check it out.

lam toldit is more interestedly written than the Buchanan one,

- I talked to this fellow Gen. Staylan. He is a French general
somewhat related'to the de Gaulle movement and he is an active

officex Iran into him somewhere along the line and I got to talking
about the assassination with him ahd talked about the extent of all

this todo.. And one evening he said, well, I'll tell you, you know

I have’ been associated with de Gaulle's govt. to some degree and

am thought to be in that camp. But he said, this assassination business
and all these articles have now become sort of interwoven into the
anti-American propaganda of France which is quite prevalent. Some

of it, he said, is mspired in the sense that the Gaulle's papers
have it, whether it comes from the govt. or not is something
else again. Butin any rate, it is the body of that and had been
incorporated in it in sort of an argument for the instability and
lack of dependability of the United States. Here was this noble
young soul who was very popular in Hance and elsewhere, and
that he was too good, so to speak, for the United States.

So they just knocked him off.

He came into his own, and his own received him not.

Now, the difficulty is, that this fellow Buchanan is a very articulate

on the radio and on TV. He has made several broadcasts and he

has gotten his story over to the point that if your report doesn't dispose
of it point by point, your report is a whitewash.

That is right.

And that is what my friends tell me. I passed that on to the
Chief Justic e.

Oh, there is no doubt that that is the case. It is not going to be
an easy thing to deal with it all, but we will have to take up his
points to a degree that they don't deserve, I think.

Yes, lam afraid you will. Well, fine, Jack, you let me know.

Yes, I will.
