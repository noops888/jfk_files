Although this employee is a fine intelligence officer and has worked

her service in Mexico City from 1957 ‘through ovhere she served as a
“trouble-shooting” case officer for the en ae le Winfield Scott
(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station. Mr. Scott, a stern task-
master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as “intelligent, hard
working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the
most competent Si/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."
Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this
appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. In her final
assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff
(October 197: ctober 1971), earning the following remarks from her
supervisor: -I venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years
of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which

this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organij-

zation will be weakened. The reviewing official agreed with the above

By virtue of \Wifsual \ to duty which over a
period of several yea 'f consistently long hours,
superior performance ¥ ble achievement in sensitive
matters of national se®urity, Miss Goodpasture has excelled

responsible for the identification of Lee Harvey Oswald
in his dealings with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. She was
also responsible for other important and successful Opera-
tions against Soviet penetration efforts directed toward
the United States from Mexico. She would rather work than
rest, and when she works, she always impresses her super-
iors with her mastery over her craft. For thirty years
Miss Goodpasture has given unstintingly of herself to

the cause and mission of this Agency; the Agency owes her
