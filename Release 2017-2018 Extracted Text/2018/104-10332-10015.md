To:. C/ HRG

Subject: Request from Scott's son

The HSCA-orginated material in the CIA JFK Collection

and HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are scheduled

I expect copies of the two

documents mentioned in Mark Zaid's letter to be within this

material.

However, there is no inventory of this materials

and

a search could be very time consuming.

HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are usually

held at NARA for review by an HRG reviewer (John C) : NARA

has sent some documents (mainly testimonies) directly to HRG

two documents are not among them.

The HSCA report on Oswald in Mexico city was released

in August 1993. The pages attached to Zaid's letter are

from that report.

We could ask NARA to pull the two documents and send

them over for review.

Otherwise, they will be released

later this year:

responsive to gunn's first request in her office.

I have

spoken withl

and we agree that, with your concurrence,

the best course of action would be to have Gunn view the

Scott documents and manuscript at OGC.

You should be aware

that during the course of that litigation, searches were

conducted to locate personal effects seized by CIA upon

Scott's death.

Those effects were never located, but a

destruction record that seems to refer to these personal

effects was located and provided to OGC.

Gunn would need

access to that destruction record as well:

3.

The second request of Gunn also was an issue in

the Scott FOIA litigation. At that time the DO told IP&CRD

that all Angelton documents were sorted through in the 1970s

and that a separate CI Angelton holding no longer exist.

Official files were incorporated into DO record system and

material not deemed

to be official records were destroyed.

To the extent that any destruction records exist on

Angelton's records, Jeremy would like to see these as well.

and I suggest that the DO search for any such

destruction records and forward them to OGC.

In this way,

Jeremy can view them at the same time he views the Scott

documents.

4 .

Jeremy has agreed that if CIA allows him to view

the above records "informally" and he finds nothing that

relates to the assassination, then he will not make an

"official request" for these records. Of course, any

records he believes to be relevant,

he will have to make an

official request and they will then become part of the JFK

Collection.

DRAFT NOTES BY TIG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

JANUARY 13, 1997

On January 13, 1997, Michelle Combe and Jeremy Gunn from the ARRE Staff reviewed the files

of Winston Mckinley Scott at CLA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The General Counsel & Oince

stated that that the files presented for our examination are the "complete" files known to the CIA on Soott.

The documents total approsimately 6 inches, and include:

(1) A manuscript entitled "Il Came to Little," by Ian Maxwell (pseud), which comains 221

enumerated pages. The foreword to the manuscript states that the events recounted therein contain "no

exaggerations and no deviations from basic truth." (unpaginated forward). It reveals that some true.

names have been used, and that this has been done without the consent af the persons named. The author

expresses his "most sincere admiration and utmost respect for: Mr. John Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal

Burenu of Investegation [sic); Mr. James R. Murphy, wartime director af OSS/X-2; and partieriarly, the

late Allen Welsh Dule, OSS Chier in Switzerland during World War IL, a principal architect in the

creation of CIA for President Harry Truman and the Greatest Director CLA hamhad." The author refers to

the blight of communiam, and the courageous people who have worked to fight it but nevertheless

concludes that "all the effort (to thwart Communism] has come to little," (unpaginated forward)

There in only one chapter that makes any identifiable reference to the assassination of President

Kennedy and to the eventa relatod to Menico. City at the time Lee Harvey Oswald was alleged, to have

vinited. That chapter has been released in fill to the public.

(2) A Supplemental Declaration of J. Barry Harrelson from the case Michael Scott.v. CIA, CA

No. 1:9SCV00686 with attached documents. The attached documents contain documente released in full

and some that are redacted. According to CIA, all redacted documents are a part of the IPK collection,

This should be confirmed. If they are part of the collection, no further stops need be taken. If not, they

must be fully reviewed to determine whether they are assassination recorde.

(3) Documents that appear to be copies of the personnel file of Win Scott. All of the documents

in this file were reviewed to determine whether any assassination records are included. Our review

disclosed no "arassination records." Although not assassination records, the following information was

located in the personnel file:

"connection with espionage and subversive activities" and in "counteresplonage" while based, in Havana.

conscion he copies.

- The records disclose that during World War II, while in the employ of the FBI, Scott worked in

- Document, dated 7/23/69, refers to the possibility that CIA might attempt to recruit Scott for

the "Civilian Reserve Program (HR 20-15) following his retiroment from the agency.

- On May 6, 1969, Soott was recommended for a Distinguished Intelligence Medal by William

V. Broe, who was then Chief of WH. The recommendation includes the following statement:

"Mr. Scott built a large and highly effective organization targeted against highest priority

national security targets; namely, the Soviet bloc presence south of the border. Given the nature

af the target, Mr. Scott molded his station with a predominantly CI orientation until it has

become a highly éffective counterintelligence mechanism capable of covering Soviet Bloc and

Cuban [activities]."

His Cltation for the Distinguished Intelligence Medal includes the following statement:

"Fife has served brilliantly in Mexes for over twelve years where among other thing he has

bullt a remarkablo counterintelligence machine-a true bulwark helping to guard our southern

border. Fils station has long beeri a showcase of technical intelligence methods as well as

classical operations."

- There is no record in the file that suggests, one way or the other, that Mr. Scott was ever

treated for or suffered from any mental or emotional issue.

Unless the following are already part of the JFK collection, they should be designated "essassination

records" and processed under the JFK Act.

DRAFT NOTES BY TIG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

JANUARY 15, 1997

Cleveland Cram

Untitled (History of the oid Cl stafi) (beginning to dismissal of Angleton)

11 Volumes (c. 1981)

Albert S. Bonner

The Port -Angleton CL Staff

2 volumes (uly, 1993)

The ARRE requented aocess to any and all internal CIA histories of the CI saff for the purpose of

determining whether they contain any information that would be useful for understanding the

amassination of President Kennedy, Imcluding, for example, the activities of Lee Harvey Orwald, shé

structure of CI with respect to the comporients of the office that had responsibility for handling Oswald's

tle at diterent times (particulary Cy SIG), and any apect Of HTLINGDAL related to Orwald, Because

the Agency keops these historios closely held, it was bolieved that they are relativoly more likely to be

candid assessments of CI and its activities than one might obtain from more widely circulate documbnts.

I was provided complete access to the entire 11 volumes of Cleveland Cram'a (untitled) history of the old

CI staff. The Cram history covers counterintelligence at the CIA from its origins to the departure of

James Jesus Angleton. The hintories appear as typod legal-size pages in green, cardboard folders. The.

first volume is hand dated (1981) and signed "Cleveland Cram." There are 1063 pages in the Cram

history. I was also provided complete access to Al Bonner's history of counterintelligence, which starts

with the departure of Angleton and continues to the present.

By all appearances, the histories appear to be relatively candid assessments of CL. I was able to identify

information that illuminated some of the lucs of concert, and those will be outlined below. I identified

no information that would lend to any significant reevaluation of the role of CI in issues related to Oswald

or to the assassination. For the purpose of understanding the assamination of the President or the other

issues that come within the scope of the Review Board's mandate - other than the information identified

below " I do not believe that the histories themselves, nor coples of any of the pages of the histories,

would provide any significant useful additional information that would enhance the understanding of the

assassination and I see no noed for any further information to be released from the histories. In la my

preliminay judgment that the page rumber highlighted below should be copled and atached to this

memorandom no that they car be made publie

The information contained in the historice consists largely of case studies of important counterintelligence

activilies. As a rule, the histories do not describe the structure of the Cl officer, the personnel, the filing

system, or operations gencraly « although discussion of some or these issues arises. The principal

sources used by the authors consisted of documents from CI and interviews with officers. There are

relatively few footnotes and the citations are, accordingly, quite thin. There are, for example, only &

footnotes in volume 1, which themselves are sketchy. The points that enhance the historical

understanding of the assassination are:

1. The introduction to Cram's history refers to an carlier CI history that was waltten by a person

who was provided only limited acces to Angleton and the files. The author of the first history

was given, for example, no access to any CI/SIC documents. Cram, accordingly, found the

history to be unhelpful for understanding sensitive Cl activities. (Cram, p. 1-2). There are

references to two additional documents that should be requested: the Galeniewall study on

Golitayn (1975) and the John Hart study on Nosenko (called the "Monster Plot" ). (Charles

Battaglia, Staff Director of the SSCI, told me that the ARRB should request the Monster Plot for

revlew under the JFK Act.)

P.5/8

2 SECRET

2. There is a reference to a 1959 IG survey of CI which should be requested for review. (See,

e.g, Crum 47, S6

3. The 1959 IG analysla stated the within the CI stuff, "96 were professionals, 75 clerical and

four staff agents. The Staff also had one Headquarters contract agent, and several agents under

projects." (Cram, 48).

4. There in a discussion of the Special Investigations Unit (ciren 1959) and HTLINGUAL,

Coples of pages 49-51, and 55, which describe the STU and HITLINQUAL, should be evaluated to

determine whether they contribute to understanding of relevant lemen.

3. Angleton was on sick leave from the agency from May, 1960 to 12 January 1961. During

Angieton's absence, S. Herman Horton was Acting Chief and James Hunt was Acting Deputy

Chief. Hunt subsequently became the regular deputy and served until 1969. (Cram: 38).

6. Routine liaison with FBI was conducted by Jans Roman "from the late 1940s anward,.."

(Cram, 70). Sonsitive matters were handled, however, by Angleton or Hunt (Cram, 70) although

this practice "did not develop until the early 1960s after the defection of Golltsyn..." (Cram,

71).

%. The activitles of CI/SIG are described on pp. 144-45. Cram'a cited sources are the 1955 and

1973 decriptions of its activities. It should be decided whether these two pages should be copied

for attachment to thig memo.

I did not find that the references to Nosenio provided additional information that enhances the historical

understanding of the assassination. Mr. Angleton's tertimony to the Church Committee ie much more

illuminating in that regard.

The Bonner history, although after the perlod of Oswald and the assassination, discusses the issues of the

disposition of the files of James Jesus Angleton and a few other matters. Because of the speculation about

the contents of the files, discussions of their disposition would seem to be relevant. The pertinent painte

are as follows:

Bonner volume I:

1. Bonner describes the CI staff, at the departure of Angleton, as being seriously unorganized

and as being intelléctually detached from the work of the ngency. (Bonner, p. I:6-8)

2. The Angieton office files were voluminous and in disarray at the time of his departure from

the Agency. It may be appropriate to make copies of pp. 1:8 (ant paragraph) up to the last

piragraph on p. 14, 33-97 to illustrate this.

3. "Fliles were found on the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert

F. Kennedy. These included autopsy pictures of the remains of Robert Kennedy. Although

Nosenko's account of the KGB's involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald and his denial that the

KGB had anything to do with the murder of John Kennedy might reasonably explain an

Angleton interest in the John Kennedy assassination, neither Kalaris nor Blee, with whom

Kalaris consulted on this bizarre finding, had any idea why Angleton had the pictures. Neither

could they think of any reason why it was appropriate for CI Staff files to contain them. They

were accordingly destroyed." (Bonner, p. I:1l). I subsequently interviewed Bonner, who told me

P. 6/8

CERAFT

that he had poken to Kalaris and Alce about this, and neither man could remember anything in

the files except the Robart Kennedy photographs.

4. The tiles revealed evidence that Angleton ran "counterintelligence (operations] abroad as

Chief of the CI Staff in the way in which the local station would be effectively cut out and

command channel and communications would run direct to counterintelligence headquarters in

Washington." (Bonner, D. I:22.) (sic), I beliove Bonner is saying the following: Angleton ran

counterintelligence operations abroad as Chief of the CI Staff in such a way that local stations

would be edectively cut out; command channel and communications would run direct to

counterintelligence headquarters in Washington.

3. Bonner cites two examples where Angleton ran liaison with friendly governments without the

local station chiefs being specifically aware of Angleton's activities. The station chief found this

*frustrating." (Bonner, Pp. I:23-26):

6. (Circa 1976) "Handling IPOLA requests for information concerning Lee Hawey Orwald)

required the creation of a tank force of 13 operations officers and analysts, plus clerical personnel,

and their full-time efforts for over a month." (Bonner, p. 1:67.)

7. Discussion of activities of part of Cl staft circa 1976: "Double Agent Branch o was Charged

with the conduct of and coordination on double agent operations abroad. Since the vast majority

of DA cases were run by the US military services, the FBI, ormin some instances--foreign-liaison

services, the branch was very heavily a coordinator rather than active runner of operations.*

(Bonner, p. 1:71).

8. Bonner refers to an August 1976 IG report sometimes called the Freer report It analyzes

Angleton's stewardship over CI compared to that of Kalaria, It discusses how Angleton ran Cl.

We should review this report. (it is cited in Mangold, Cold Warrior, at 316.]

Bonner volume II:

The only significant reference in Bonner pertains to the final completion of the review of the Angleton

fles. (Sonner, p. I:114.)

REVIEW OF MANGOLD V. CIA FILES

JANUARY 13 and 24, 1997

The Mangeld y, CIA FOIA ligation files consist of 7 redwelds, totalling approximately 18 laches, They

are organized by "abs," which can be described as follows:

Tab A: copies of published newspaper and magazine clippings that were released in full. I see no niced to

designate any documents as assination records from the set

Tab B; coples of published newmaper articles, the texts of which have been released in full. The agency

did redact marginalia, which consisted exclusively of file names and indicators. I see no need to

designate any documents as assassination records from the set.

Tab C: documents about Angleton from the 1940s, including his carcer with OSS. I see no need to

designate any documente as assassination recorde from the set.

Tab D: docs 94-230, AR (unlea already part ol the colliction): Doce, 95(24 Nov, 1978

Memorindum JJA tertimony to ESCA), On December 11, 1978, the D.C. -based law firm of Duncan,

Brown filed a FOLA request on behalf of James Angleton in conjunction with his anticipated tertimony

before the FISCA. Presumably all records related to this matter are AR and should be processed under the

JFK Ach See doc, nos. 109-116, 120, 121.

Includes fitness reports (not designated). All of the fitness reports were reviewed to determine whether

they contained probative information.

Tab E: documents previously relensed to Edward J. Epstein in response to a request for book revlews from

CIA's internal jourmal "Studies in Intelligence." These documents are all coples of book reviews from

Studies in Intelligence on issues related to intelligence. I see no need to designate any documents as

mansinntion records from the set.

Tab F' contains documents previoualy released to Henry Hurt in response to a request for documenta

concerning Alexander Orlov. Most of the documents an newspaper articles and reprints of Senate

testimony. I see no need tò designate any documents as assassination recorda from the set.

Tab & contains documents previously released to A. Doppelt (on behalf of The Readers Digest in

response to a request for documents concerning Nicholas Shadrin. These documents include a speoch by

DC Turner, tostimony by Capt. Nikolai Fedorovich Artamonov (Shadrin) before the Comittee on Un-
