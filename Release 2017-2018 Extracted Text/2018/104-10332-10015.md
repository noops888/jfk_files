Subject: Request from Scott's son

The HSCA-orginated material in the CIA JFK Collection
and HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are scheduled
for review later this year. I expect copies of the two
documents mentioned in Mark Zaid's letter to be within this
material. However, there is no inventory of this materials
and a search could be very time consuming.

HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are usually
held at NARA for review by an HRG reviewer (John C). NARA
has sent some documents (mainly testimonies) directly to HRG
but two documents are not among them.

The HSCA report on Oswald in Mexico city was released
in August 1993. The pages attached to Zaid's letter are
from that report.

We could ask NARA to pull the two documents and send
them over for review. Otherwise, they will be released
later this year.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Fred Wickham Po
FROM: Barry Harrelson
SUBJECT: ARRB Request re Angelton and Scott

1. Jeremy Gunn, ARRB staff, has requested (via
telephone) access to the following files/documents: if

a. Winston Scott documents, including the entire

manuscript_It Came to Little, and personal effects seized on
Winston Scott's death; . “y

documents on his. father,’ has copies of documents

responsive ‘'s fir: est: in her office. I have
. Spoken witn( pana we agree that, with your concurrence,
the best coursé Of action would be to have Gunn view the
Scott documents and manuscript at OGC. You should be aware
that during the course of that litigation, searches were
conducted to locate personal effects seized by CIA upon
Scott's death. Those effects were never located, but a
destruction record that seems to refer to these personal
effects was located and provided to OGC. Gunn would need
access to that destruction record as well. urigneatie

3. The second request of Gunn also was an issue in
the Scott FOIA litigation. At that time the DO told IP&CRD
that all Angelton documents were sorted through in the 1970s
and that a separate CI Angelton holding no longer exist.
Official files were incorporated into DO record system and
material not deemed to be official records were destroyed.
To the extent that any destruction records exist on™
Angelton's records, Jeremy would like to see these as well.

= and I suggest that the DO search for any such™
lestruction records and forward them to OGC. In this way,
Jeremy can view them at the same time he views the Scott
documents.

4. Jeremy has agreed that if CIA allows him to view
the above records "informally" and he finds nothing that
relates to the assassination, then he will not make an
“official request" for these records. Of course, any
records he believes to be relevant, he will have to make an
official request and they will then become part of the JFK
Collection.

DRAFT NOTES BY TIG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD
JANUARY 13, 1997

On January 13, 1997, Michelle Cambs and Jeremy Gunn from the ARRB Staff reviowed the files
of Winston McKinley Scott at CLA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The General Counsel’s office
stated that that the files presented for our examination are the “complete” files known to the CIA on Scott.

The documents total approximately 6 inches, and include:

(2) A manuscript entitied “It Came to Little,” by Ian Maxwell (pseud.), which contains 221
enumerated pages. The foreword to the manuscript states that the events recounted therein contain “no
exaggerations and no deviations from basic truth.” (unpaginated forward). It reveals that some true,
names have been used, and that this has been done without the consetit af the persons named, ‘The author
expresses his “most sincere admiration and utmost respect for: Mr. John Edgar Hoover,-Director, ae :
Bureau of Investegation [aic}; Mr. James R. Murphy, wartime director of OSS/X-2; and
Tate Allon Welsh Dulles, OSS Chief in Switzerland during World War IL, s principal
creation af CLA for President Harry Truman and the Greatest Director CIA has‘had.” prepasted
the blight of communiam, and the courageous people who have worked to fight if, but nevertheless
Concludes that “all the effott [to thwart Comuiiunism] has come to little,” (unpaginated forward)

There is only one chapter that makes any identifiable reference to the assassination of President
Kennedy and to the eventa related to Mexico City at the time Lee Harvey Oswald was alleged to have
visited. That chapter has been réleased in full to the public,

(2) A Supplemental Dectaration of J. Barry Harrelson from the caso Michael Scott v. CIA, CA
No, 1:95C'V00686 with attached docuinents. The attached documents contain documents released in full
and some that are redacted, Actording to CIA, all redacted documents are a part of the JFK collection,
‘This should be confirmed, If they are part of the collection, no further steps need be taken, ‘fnot, they
must be fully reviewed to determine whethier they are assassination records,

@) Documents that appear to be copies of the personnel file of Win Scott. All of the documents
in this file were reviewed to determine whether arty assassination records are included. Our review
disclosed no “ausassination records.” Although not assassination records, the following information was
located in the personnel file:

=~ The records disclose that during World War II, while in the employ of the FBI, Scott worked in
“connection with espionage and subversive activities” and in “counterespionage” while based.in Havana.

—~ Document, dated 7/23/69, refers to the possibility that CIA might attempt to recruit Scott for
the “Civilian Reserve Program (HR 20-15) following his retirement from the agency.

— On May 6, 1969, Scott was recommended for a Distinguished Intelligence Medal by William
V. Broe, who waa then Chief af WH. The recommendation includes the following statement:

“Mr. Scott built a large and highly effective organization targeted against highest priority
national security targets; namely, the Soviet bloc presence south of the border. .Given the nature
of the target, Mr. Scott molded his station with a predominantly CI orientation until it has
become a highly effective counterintelligence mechanism capable of covering Soviet Bloc and
Cuban [activitiog).”

Hig Citation for the Distinguished Intelligence Medal includes the following statement:

DRAFT NOTES BY TJG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD
JANUARY 15, 1997

Cleveland Cram

Untitted (History af the old CI staff) (beginning to dismissal of Angleton)
11 Volumes (¢. 1981)

A

Albert S. Bonner
2 volumes (July, 1993)

The ARRB requested access to any and all internal CLA histories of the CI staff for the purpose af
determining whether they contain any information that would be useful for understanding the
assassination of President Kennedy, including, for example, the activities of Lee Harvey Oswald, the
structure of CI with respect to the camponents of the office that had responsibility for handling Oswald’a
file at different times (particularly C1/SIG), and any aspect of HTLINGUAL related to Because
the Agency keeps these historios closely held, it was bolleved that they are relatively more likély to be
candid assessments of CI and its activitics than one might obtain from more widely circulate circulate documbats.

‘Twas provided complete access to the entire 11 volumes of Cleveland Cram’s (untitled) history of the old
Cl saff.. The Cram history covers counterintelligence at the CLA from its origins to the departure of
James Jesus Angleton, The histories appear as typed legal-aize pages in green, cardboard folders. The.
first volume ig hand dated (1981) and signed “Cleveland Cram.” There are 1063 pages in the Cram
history, I was also provided complete acceas to Al Bonner’s history of counterintelligence, which starts
with the departure of Angleton and continues to the present.

By all appearances, the histories appear to be relatively candid assessments of CL I was able to identify
information that illuminated some of the issues of concern, and those will be outlined below. I identified
no information that would lead to any significant reevaluation of the role of CI in issues related to Oswald
‘Of to the assaseination, For the purpose of understanding the assassitiation of thie President or the other
issues that come within the scope of the Review Board's mandate — other than the information identified
below = 1 do not believe that the histories themselves, nor copies of any of the pages of the histories,
‘would provide any significant useful additional information that would enfiance the understanding of the
‘assassination and I see no nsed for any further information to be released from the histories, It la amy
préllminary Judgment that the page numbers Kighlighted below should be copied and attached to this
memorandum so that they can be made public. ©

‘The information contained in the histories consists largely of case studies of important counterintelligenos
activities. As a rule, the histories do not describe the structure of the Cl affices, the personnel, the filing
system, or operations generally = although discussion of some of these issues arises. The principal
‘sources used by the authors consisted of documents from CI and interviews with officers. There are
Telatively few footnotes and the citations are, accordingly, quite thin. There are, for example, only 8
footnotes in volume 1, which themselves are sketchy. The points that enhance the historical .
understanding of the assassination are:

1, The introduction to Cram’s history refers to an carlier CI history that was written by a person
who was provided only limited access to Angleton and the files, The author of the first history
‘was given, for example, no access to any C/SIG documents, Cram, accordingly, found the
history to be unhelpful for understanding sensitive Cl activities. (Cram, p. 1-2). There are
referenices to two additional documents that should be requested: the Goleniewski study on
Golitsyn (1975) and the John Hart study on Nosenko (called the “Monster Plot” ). (Charles
Battaglia, Staff Director of the SSCI, told me that the ARRB should request the Monster Plot for
review under the JFK Act.)


13-00000

+s JAN 27 '97 18:25AM USGOVERNMENT P.S/8

> SpeRet

2, There is a reference to a 1959 IG survey of CI which should be requested for review. (See,
o.g., Cram 47, 56

2. ‘The 1959 1G analysis stated the within the CI stuff, “96 were professionals, 75 clerical and
four staff agents. The Staff also had one Headquarters contract agent, and several agents under
Projects.” (Cram, 48),

4. There is a discussion of the Special Investigations Unit (circa 1959) and HTLINGUAL,”
Coples of pages 49-81, and $4, which describe the STU and HTLINGUAL, should be evaluated to
détermine whether they contribute to understanding of relevant issues, ity

5. Angleton was on sick leave from the agency from May, 1960 to 12 January 1961. During
Angleton’s absence, §. Herman Horton was Acting Chief and James Hunt was Acting Deputy
Chief. Hunt subsequently became the regular deputy and served until 1969,(Cram, $8).

6, Routine liaison with FBI was conducted by Jano Roman “from the late 1940s onward... .

(Cram, 70). Seaman wt be ove Angion Hat (a) jngh
this practice “did not develop until the early 1960s after the defection of Golltsyn.....” (Cram,
n).

7, The activities of CI/SIG are described on pp, 144-48, Cram’s cited sources are the 1955 and
1973 descriptions of its activities. It should be decided whether these two pages should be copied
for attachment to this memo.

I did not find that the references to Nosenko provided additional information that enhances the historical
understanding of the assassination. Mr. Aagleton's testimony to the Church Committes is much more
illuminating in that regard.

‘The Bonner history, although after the period of Oswald and the assassination, discusses the issues of tho
disposition of the files of James Jesus Angleton and a few other matters. Because of ths speculation about
the contents of the files, discussions af thelr disposition would seem to be relevant. ‘The pertinent paints
are as follows:

‘Bonner volume I:

1, Bonner describes the CI staff, at the departure of Angleton, as being seriously unorganized
and as beltig intellectually detached from the work of the agency, @onner, p. 16-8.)

2 ‘The Angleton office files were voluminous and in disarray at the time of his departure from
the Agency. It may be appropriate to make copies of pp. I:8 (last paragraph) up to the last
paragraph on p. 14, 53-57 to illustrate this,

3, “[Fliles were found on the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert
F. Kennedy. These included autopsy pictures of the remains of Robert Kennedy. Although
Nosenko's account of the KGB's involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald and his denial that the
KGB had anything to do with the murder of John Kennedy might reasonably explain an
Angleton interest in the John Kennedy assassination, neither Kalaris nor Blee, with whom.
Kalaris consulted on this bizarre finding, hed any idea why Angleton had the pictures. Neither
could they think of any reason why it was appropriate for CI Staff files to contain them. They
‘were accordingly destroyed.” (Bonmer, p. 1:11). I subsequently interviewed Bonner, who told me


13-00000
“., JAN 27°97 18:26AM USGOVERNMENT P.6/8

_ > of entt

that he had spoken to Kalaris and Blee about this, and neither man could remember anything in
the files except the Robert Kennedy photographs.

4. The files revealed evidence that Angleton ran “countorintelligence [operations] abroad as
Chief of the CI Staff in the way in which the local station would be effectively cut out and _
command cliannel and communications would run direct to counterintelligence headquarters in
Washington.” (Bonner, p, 1:22.) (sic). I believe Bonner is saying the following: Angleton ran
counterintelligence operations abroad as Chief of the CI Staff in such a way that local stations
would be effectively cut out; command channel and communications would run direct to
counterintelligerice headquarters in Washington.

$s. Bonner cites two examples where Angleton ran laicon with flendly governments without the
local station chiefs being specifically aware of Angleton’s activitics, The station chiefs found this
“frustrating.” (Bonner, pp, 1:25-26),

6. (Circa.1976) “[EJandling [FOIA requests for information concerning Lee H Oswald]
required the creation of a task force of 13 operations officers and analysts, plus Deron,
‘and their fill-tisne efforts for over a month,” Bonner, p. 1:67.) .

7, Discussion of activities of part of Cl stuff circa 1976; “Double Agent Branch = was charged
with the canduct of and coordination on double agent operations abroad. Since the vast majority
of DA cases were run by the US military services, the FBI, or--in some instances-foreign-liaison.
services, the branch was very heavily’a coordinator rather than active runner of operations.”
Bonner, p. 1:71).

8, Bonner refers to an August 1976 IG report sometimes called the Freer report. It analyzes
Angleton’s stewardship over Cl.compared to that of Kalariz, It discusses how Angleton ran CI.
We should review this report, His cited in Mangold, Cold Warrior, at 316.]

The only significant reference in Bonner pertains to the final complction af the review of the Angleton
files. (Bonner, p. 1:114,)
