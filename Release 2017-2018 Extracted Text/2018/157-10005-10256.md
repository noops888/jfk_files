staff of 43 at work, Operations commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.

(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State, USIA.)

As the operations develop, there will be both increased

intelligence collection and a need for as current an In-

By 31 March, have 105 agents

selected and 50 agents trained.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

16 - 31 March 1962 (cont.)

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence.

CONSIDERATIONS

Possible future use in communications and support.

To ready agent operationes:

* Develop intelligence potential

of Cuban "colonies" in U.S.

To exploit the intelligence possi-

bilities of former residents of

Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now

in the United States.

* Develop additional interroga-

¡on centers in other areas by

31 March 196z.

To collect intelligence in a Latin

atmosphere, at different levels thai

now seem possible in the continental

U.S., to spot additional intelligence

assets and to provide security

against Communist agent operations.

Effectiveness and numbers are

dependent upon purpose

of recruitment, nature of training,

and policy decisions

controlling these factors.

If the recruitment and train-

ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-

ment and training will be much less difficult than if

they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes

only.

There are "colonies" in Washington, D.C., and other

U.S. cities which are "little Cubas," Family, Church,

and business interests provoke unusual personal ties

inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential

exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail.
