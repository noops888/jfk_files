: By letter dated 1/27/59, the Milwaukee Office
advised NY, that it was unable to verify subjegt Etendance
at the University of Wisconsin. Also a check ©

Bs When subject was ey from the VA Hospital
2 Gin Kansas city. Missouri, on 1/18/60, he listed his home

& Saddress as 7347 Grant St., Omah&, Nebraska. VA records con-
tain nothing to indicate that he plans to return to the NYC

area.

Bow Although HARBER was apparently permanently released
a from the VA Hospital in Kansas City, he has had a past history
,of commitments to mental institutions and it is felt that he
y will probably require additional hospitalization and treatment
in the future. .

In view of the foregoing, NY feels that HARBER -{
does not constitute a threat to the security of this country '
at this time and this case is being placed in a closed status.

No consideration is being given to requesting permission to !
interview subject in view of his past history of mental ill-

nesse It is believed that such interview might well result i
in embarrassment to the Bureau feowever, should any informa-

tion come to the attention of s office indicating that

NY 105-37990

In view of the foregoing, NY has opened a 105-
Contact case on HARBER for the purposes of ascertaining the
degree of association between HARBER and/[KOVALEV]in the past {S)
and to determine if this association has continued to the
resent time. NY is also interested in ascertaining if
[Hane has any potential as a double agent (6)

The following investigation has been conducted:

On 11/18/59, Mr. JOSE MANOS, Assistant Director,
Berlitz School of Languages, 40 W. 51st St., NYC, made
available HARBER's employment record. It reflected that
HARBER first went to work for the Berlitz School as an English
Instructor on 1/5/55. He worked at irregular intervals
thereafter, his last period of employment being from March, 1958,
to 6/26/58. His application for employment reflected that he
was born on 11/26/27, in the US, that his residence address
in 1955 was 319 W. 14th St., NYC, and his Social Security
number was listed as 005-12-1422. This application further t
reflected that HARBER was at one time in the US Army (dates +e
and ASN not shown), and served in US occupation forces in -
Germany and Italy. It still further revealed that HARBER
attended the University of Wisconsin (dates and field of |
study not shown) and was formerly employed. as an Instructor
at the Boys Industrial School at Topeka, Kansas (period
not reflected). :

: the conclusion of the 11/18/59, interview, JOSE
‘MANOS advised that the Berlitz School had on several occasfions
since June, 1958, tried to get in touch with HARBER, to
ascertain if he wanted to teach courses; but they had been
uAsuccesful, even though he had left a telephone number

with them, namely CHelsea 3-7208. According to MANOS, an
individual'who identified himself as AMERICO had answered

the telephone each time they called advising that HARBER

was out of the city. - ae :
