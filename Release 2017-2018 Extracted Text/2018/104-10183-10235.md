ROBRENO Marquez aka “EL Mago" who has communicated
with A/I by letter and phone from Paris 02 several ,
occasions, having brought 2 “personal” message from
AMLASH/1 for A/1. A/1 is also to get a good assessment
of "EL Mago", including a determination nis reasons
for Teaving Cuba, or considering so, permanantly. It
ig possible that "£1 Mago" may be a good prospect for
récruétiient; although as an individual, he is not
particularly palatable. This opinion is also that
of both AMLASH and A/1; but as an action type, he may
be suitable for specific tasks. (See report of
28-29 February 1964 Meeting) A/1 was told to bear
in mind that a person of this type could have been
co-opted hy the DS5E in return for dropping of possible
criminal charges for public brawls, etc ‘As discussed
in-the previous contact report, "£1 Ma drinks
heavily to the extent that he upon more than one
peeasion has gotten into serious brawls, including
the one several years ago in which he shot an Anerican
citizen for alleged advances to a girl friend of his.
("EL Mago's" motives and truc allegiance remain clouded,

to say the least.)

c. According to letters from “El Mago," Jose
Alberto IBARRA Martin, aka “EL Loco Blanco", is
expected to follow "El Mago" to Paris; and he too
has additional -information from AMLASH. At this
writing, "El Loco" has not arrived in Paris. El Loco”
Js of the same ilk, same crowd, as "Et Mago," put not
