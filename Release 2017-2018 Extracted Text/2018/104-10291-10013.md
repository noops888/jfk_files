• MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

1. • Chief, DO and I talked tol

this morning about

the possibility. of hie converting from staller to career agent.

After considerable discussion,I

agreed to the conversion. He

is obviously doing this reluctantly, but he appreciates the situation

within the DDP in which the encumbrance of senior grades by long.

lime employees is blockirg the promotions of junior officers.

2.

urged that he be retained as a career agent until

he reaches the age of mandatory retirement (about three years).

Chief, DO stated that the need

for handlera

ut contacts and assets is such that there would be a continuing need

tor expertenced career agenthat unless he pulled something stupid,

he was virtually assured of career agent status until he reached

age 60, and perhaps could be employed as a retired annuitant after

that time if his performance was productive and if operational

requirementa remain as they are at present.

3.

explained why he could not retire - the next five

years will be difficult for him financially with two teen-age boys to

put through college.

Chief, DO and I

will work out the details and timing

of his conversion to career agent.
