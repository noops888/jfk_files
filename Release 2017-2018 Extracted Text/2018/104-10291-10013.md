E 1. On 26 November 1967, I reached the “break even"

point betwoen the Civil Service Retirement System and the
Organization's System, having completed 36 years and 11 months
of’ Government Service on that date.

2. Since I plan to work until age 60, at which time I
will have 40 years of Government Service, it is my desire to
revert to the Civil Service System in ordor to take advantage
of the increased annuity under that System. :

3, I would appreciate it therefore if you would take
whatever steps may be fecessary to. transfer my retirement

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

. 1.» Chief, DO and 1 talked t this morning about
the possibility. of hie reson trom staffer to career agent.

After considerable discussion, agreed to the conversion. He
is obviously doing this reluctantly, but he appreciates the eituation
within the DDP in which the encumbrance of senior grades by long=
time employees is blocking the promotions of junior officers.

2. [__Jurged that he be retained ae a career agent until
he reaches the age of mandatory retirement (about three years).
Chief, DO stated that the need| for handlers
of contacts and assets is such that there would bo a continuing need

for experienced career agents
I tol hat unless he pulled something stupid,

he,was virtually assured of career agent status until he reached
age 60, and perhaps could be employed as a retired annuitant after
that time if his performance was productive and if operational
requirements remain as they are at present.

3. xplained why he could not retire =~ the next five
years will be difficult for him financially with two teen-age boys to
put through college. H

4 Chief, DO and! will work out the details and timing
of his conversion to career agent.
