INTRODUCTION

Legally, the assassination of President Kennedy and the’
subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, the suspected assassin, was
within the jursidiction of authoritiés of the State of Texas.

But many Americans were questioning how a President could be
assassinated despite the vast U.S. intelligence apparatus. Many
were also openly skeptical of the FBI's stated findings that Oswald
was the assassin and that he acted alone.

Congress and the President felt that public concern could
only be assuaged by what they believed was a thorough and independent
investigation of the assassination. Two resolutions were submitted
in Congress calling for congressional investigations into the
circumstances surrounding the assassination: The State of Texas
set up a Commission for the same purpose. President Johnson, in
establishing the Warren Commission by executive order on

November 29, 1963, preempted the field.

‘The President's publicly stated reason for establishing the
Commission was to “ensure a thorough and independent. investigation
of the circumstances surrounding the assassination.'' In that the
only investigations of the assassination on record were the invest-
igations that had been conducted by the Dallas Police Department
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- and taking into account
the public criticism and skepticism directed at these two agencies --
it can be inferred from President Johnson's public statements chat
the Commission's investigation was to be independent from the

NW 50955 -Reptas32429a2fe eBast He Commission's report noted: "Because of the


L

numerous rumors and théories the public interest in insuring the

truth could not be met merely by adopting the. reports or the

analysis of Federal or state agencies."

When it began work in earnest in. mid-December, the Commission
was supplied with a. tremendous number of xeports: from various
Federal and state agencies. By far the greatest number of reports

emanated from the FBI; of particular importance was the five

volume, December 9, 1963, Report summarizing the Bureau's immediate

post assassination investigation. Subsequently, the Commission

requested and received the field investigation reports upon which

the December 9, 1963, report. had been based.

in its report:

As these investigative reports were
received, the staff began analyzing and
summarizing them. -The members of the: legal
staff, divided into teams, proceeded to
organize the facts revealed by these in-
vestigations, determine the issues, sort
out the unresolved problems, and recommend
additional investigation by the Commission

After reviewing the accumulating ma-
terials, the. Commission directed numerous
additional requests to Federal and State
agencies. (Report, p. xii)

The Commission's Report also states:

Because of the diligence, cooperation, and
facilities of Federal investigative agencies,
it was unnecessary for the Commission to em-
ploy investigators, other than the members of
the Commission's legal staff. (Report, p. xiil)

With only isolated minor exceptions, the entire body of
factual material from which the Commission drew its findings was
supplied by the intelligence community, and, primarily, the FBI
Even when material was provided by an agency other than the FBI,
however, the record reflects that the agency usually first checked
with the Bureau before supplying information to the Commission.
Moreover, FBI memoranda indicate that CIA and Secret Service
personnel veviewed Director Hoover's Commission testimony prior
to the testimony of their respective agency head, for the stated
purpose of “ensuring that there were no conflicts in testimony.‘
Thus, by its own admission, the Commission was dependent
upon the intelligence agencies for the facts. As a second step,
“the Commission and its staff did analyze the material and fre-
quently requested follow up agency investigations. However, if
the Commission did not initially receive any evidence on a parti-
cular point, the second step would obviously not -be reached, and
the Commission's findings and conclusions would necessarily be

limited staff and time, could.obviously not attempt to duplicate

doubt as to whether these agencies can ever be relied upon to
investigate their own operations and their own performance in
critical situations. Moreover, if the agencies withheld infor-
mation from the Warren Commission, or if their investigation of
the assassination was deficient, the Warren Commission may have
been precluded from determining the true circumstances surrounding

the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

‘IZ. Interest of Intelligence Community in Oswald Prior to’ Assassination
A, Summary of Oswald's Activities of Interest to Intelligence
Community Generally

While the Select Committee's investigation focused on the
CIA and FBI because these two agencies were most involved in the
assassination investigation, many other intelligence agencies had
been involved in investigating Oswald's activities prior to the
assassination.

In September 1959, Oswald received an early, hardship
discharge from the Marine Corps, claiming he needed to support his
mother, but instead he left for Europe shortly after being. dis-
charged. On October 1959, he showed up in Moscow. After a reported
suicide attempt, he went to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow seeking
to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He also informed Embassy officials
that he planned to disclose to the Soviets certain classified
information he had on Marine Corps radar equipment.

Upon learning this, the Office of Naval Intelligence reviewed
Oswald's access to classified information and determined that any

disclosure he might make would do little harm... This facet was-

determined _thet—although—Osw ‘

the Air Force, then became alarmed by Oswald's defection and
submitted voluntarily to a background investigation by Air Force
intelligence. By March 1960, the military concluded that there was
little cause for concern about Oswald's defection, although the

discharge to an undesirable discharge
Relévant’ documents on Oswald were circulated chroughout
intelligence community, so ‘chac by late 1960, the Department of
Defense, CIA, State Department, FBI, and I&NS -all had intelligence
files on Oswald.

; Oswald spent two and one. haif years in the Soviet Union work-
ing in a television and radio parts factory in'Minsk. In 1961, he
met Marina and married her. They had one child born in the Soviet
Union, and a second child born in the United States about a month
before the assassination.

Oswald wrote his relatives while in the Soviet Union and
these relatives passed some of this information on to the intelli-
gence agencies. Oswald also wrote the State Department and the
Marine Corps on several matters and this correspondence was duly
included in intelligence files. “CIA's mail intercept program
also acquired correspondence. Information obtained from this.
correspondence was given to the FBI after the assassination.

By early 1962, it was learned that Oswald planned to return
to the U.S. with his wife. and daughter. ONI, FBI, I&NS, and State
Department were all involved in determining when he would return.
Oswald, in fact, returned by ship, landing in New York on June 6
1962. There he was interviewed briefly by an I&NS agent. Oswald
and his family then proceeded to Fort Worth, where he was inter-
viewed by the FBI in late June.and again in August. Neither ONI's

we

nor CIA's files indicate their contact with Oswald after his return.

was first routed to the Counterintelligence section of. the Spécial
Affairs Staff, then to the founterintelligence Division in November
1963,

Five messages related to Oswald's visit to Mexico City in Sept-~
ember and October 1963 were in the Western Hemisphere Division files on
November 22, 1963. The information contained in these messages had
not, as of that date, been incorporated in Oswald's 201 file.

CIA's mail intercept program intercepted one letter which Oswald
had written while in Russia. That letter had not been put. in his 201
file. ,

arf
Finally, a message from CIA's (WAVE station in Miami indicates
that its sources had limited information on Oswald prior to the ag-
sassination. This information and its significance is discussed in-
fra. CIA recently informed the Select Committee that this informa-
tion probably did not come from files held at che WAVE station, but
from files of Cuban exile groups connected with CIA. Technically,
therefore,. this information was not in CIA's files on Oswald prior

to the assassination.

THE BUREAU*S PRE-ASSASSINATION OSWALD FILE

A. Oswald's Defection
The Bureau opened a file on Lee Harvey Oswald on October

31, 1959, some four weeks subsequent to his departure for the
Soviet Union. The opening was apparently based upon receipt of a UPI
news ticker advising that Oswald was in Moscow, that he had applied
to renounce his American citizenship and become a Soviet citizen
for "purely political reasons," and that “he would never return to
the United States. for any reason." On Noveitber 3, 1959, the Bureau
received a copy of an internal State Department telegram which
J conf fied the news ticker and additionally noted that ex-Marine
Oswald "has offered Soviets any information he has acquired as a
enlisted radar operator."

On November 2, 1959, the Bureau determined through liaison
with the Navy Department that although the Office of Naval Intelligence
C"ONLI'') did not have any record of Oswald, the United States Marine
Corps. did have a record (Memorandum from W. A. Branigan to A. H.
Belmont, 11/4/59). These records revealed that Oswald had entered
the Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, to serve three years.
While in the service, Oswald attended the Aviation Fundamental
School and completed the Aircraft and Control and Warning Operators'

Course. However, there was no record of a security clearance. The

Since subject's defection is known to Department
of the Navy, and since subject apparently has
no knowledge of any strategic information which
would be of benefit to the Soviets, it does not
appear that any action is warranted by the Bureau
in. this matter. It is recommended, however, that
this memo be referred to the Identification
Division so subject's servicé fingerprints can be
placed in the criminal files and that a stop be
placed against the prints to prevent subject's
entering the U.S. under any name. Espionage
Section should be advised if subject again enters

On April 28, 1960, Special Agent ("SA") Joha Fain

Bur€au's stated conclusion was that:

_interviewed Oswald's mother, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, in Dallas,
Texas. She had recently received a letter addressed to Lee
from the Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland, indicating that
Lee was expected at the college on April 20, 1960. Mrs. Oswald
furnished S. A. Fain with a photograph of Lee and informed hin
that. her son had taken his birth certificate with him (Report
from Dallas Field Office to F2l Headquarters, 5/12/60). sv
memorandum dated June 3, 1960, the Bureau expressed to the State
Department its concern over the possibility that an imnoster
could be using Oswald's birth certificate, and requested all State
Department information on Oswald

Inquiries by the FBI's Paris Legal Attache ("Legat"') revealed
that Oswald had by letter, dated March 19, 1959, written the collere
announcing his intention to begin studies there in the fall of 1959.

and that

Oswadd had paid the $25 deposit. co by dd was no record of
Oswald ever having attended the School. (Memorandum from Legat,

Paris to Director, FBI, 10/12/60)

On May 9, 1961, the Bureau's review of the State Department
“passport files on Oswald revealed that:
(a) On 2/13/61, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
received an undated letter from Oswald post-
marked Minsk 2/5/61, indicating that he wished
to return to the U.S. if legal proceedings were
not brought against him. Oswald explained that
he could not. leave Minsk without permission and
therefore was writing instead of visiting.
(b) On 3/20/61, the embassy received a second
Oswald letter postmarked Minsk, 3/5/61. Oswald
requested a questionaire again explaining that

he could not come to Minsk. (Memorandum from SAC,
Washington Field Utfice to Director, FBI, 5/23/61.)

On January 11, 1961, the Bureau was informed by ONI
(istrict Intelligence Office, 8th Maval District, New Orleans,
Louisiana) that Oswald had been given an undesirable discharee
from the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve on August 17,.1960. (Report
from Dallas Field Office to FBI Headquarters, 7/3/61). According
to the Special Agent in Dallas assigned to the Oswald case, the
subsequent background investigation of Oswald -~ as discussed in
the 7/3/61 investigative report -- was “predicated” upon the
information received from Naval Intelligence. (Report from Dallas

Field Office to FBI Headquarters, 7/3/61.)

is


A’sfibsequent FBI review of the State Department's Oswald file on

8/22/61, indicated that:

(a) by letter, dated May 1961, Oswald advised
Embassy that he had no intention of returning
unless guarantee of no prosecution. He also
advised that he had married a Russian girl, and
that he wanted to return with her.

(b) On 7/8/61, Oswald appeared at the American
Embassy in Moscow with respect to his desire to
return now.

(ce). On 7/10/61, Oswald executed an application
for passport renewal at the. American Embassy.

(d) By memorandum dated 8/18/61, the State De-

partment authorized the American Embassy in Moscow

to renew Oswald's passport for direct travel to

o Director, FBI, 9/1/61)

the U.S. (Memoranduni from SAC, Washington Field Office —

Based upon Oswald's stated intention to return to the United States

and the renewal of his passport for direct travel, the FBI decided

to interview Oswald's mother, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald,-to determine

(1) "if subject (Oswald) has returned to the U.S.," and (2) "if

“subject has not returned to U.S., contact should be maintained with

Mrs. Oswald to determine subject's expected arrival in U.S." (Memo-

randum from SAC, WFO, ‘to Director, FBI, 9/1/61; Memorandum from

SAC, Dallas to Director, FBI, 9/29/61) On October 13, 1961, a

special agent in the FBI Dallas field office learned during an

interview of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald that Lee hdd not returned to

the United States and that she had no idea when they might come

or when they-would be allowed to come. (Memorandum from SAC,

Dallas to Director, FBI, 11/20/61)

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 16



The “final FBI review of the State Department Oswald file on 1/29/62,

revealed that:

aes) By letter to Embassy, dated 7/15/61,: Oswald
advised that he was continuing his efforts ‘to
obtain exit visas for his wife and himself.

(2). By letter, dated 8/8/61, Oswald inquired
if it would be permissible for him to travel

through Poland by train after leaving Minsk,

pointing out that he could not-afford to fly

from Moscow to New York City.

(3) By letter dated 10/4/61, Oswald asked
Embassy to assist him-in obtaining exit visas
from Soviet authorities. u

(4). By letter, dated 1/5/62, Oswald informed
Embassy that he expected to'receive exit visas
within forty five days. (NOTE: Embassy had
“been notified by Soviet Ministry of Foreign
Affairs that. visas granted). (Memorandum from”SAcp-~
Washifigtén> DC field office, to Director, FBI,
2/19/62) > :

On May 17, 1962, the State Department informed the Bureau that:

Et has been determined that Oswald, the ex-Marine
is still an American citizen; both he and his Soviet
wife now have exit.permits, and the Department has
given approval for their travel with their infant
child to the U.S.A. There is.a problem with his
wife, however, in that SOV in the Department is
trying to get a waiver of 243 G, which requires
that Oswald's wife pick up her visa for entry into
the U.S.A. in Western Europe. As soon as this
question has been settled, they will be free to
travel. (Memorandum from Director; FBI; "to SAC, -
Dalias; 5/31/62)

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 17


- B. Oswald's Return to the United States

On May 31, 1962, an FRI headquarters supervisor instructed
the Dallas Field office that Oswald should be interviewed upon. his
return and that the “daterviewing agents attempt to ascertain
whether he ‘was recruited by Soviet Intelligence, whether he made
aay deals with the Soviets in order to obtain permission to return
to the United States, and exactly what information he furnished
to the Soviets. . The supervisor noted that if any doubt existed
as to Oswald's truthfulness, the agents should “consider requestine ;
his consent to a polygraph examination and thereafter obtain Bureau

authority for such an examination." (Memorandum from Director, FBI,

to SAG, Dallas, 5/31/62)

On June 12, 1962, the Immigration and Naturalization Service

(TENS ) informed the Bureau's New York field office that the Oswald's
were listed on the ‘advance manifest of the "SS Maasdam," Holland-
American Lines, which vessel was scheduled to dock at approximately
11:00 a.m., on June 13, 1962.- (Memorandum from SAC, New York to.
Director, FBI, 6/12/62) On June 14, 1962, FBI Headquarters

advised the New York field office that the Dallas field office had

been instructed to interview Oswald upon his return; the New York

field office was directed to contact I8NS to verify Oswald's arrival

and to determine his destination in the United States. (Memo-

“On June 22, 1962, IéNS confirmed that Oswald's family returned
to the United States via Hoboken, New Jersey, on June 13, 1962, and
that I&NS Inspector Frederick J. Wiedersheim interviewed Oswald at
that time. Wiedersheim orally advised a Bureau agerit that Oswald
stated he had been employed as a mechanic in Russia, had threatened
to renounce his United States citizenship, but never carried through’ -
with the threat and had never voted in Russia. The Oswald's destin-
ation. of Fort Worth, Texas, was also verified, (Memorandum from
SAC, New York, to’Director, FBI, 6/26/62) :
On June 26, 1962, SA's John Fain and B. Tom Carter interviewed

Lee Harvey Oswald in Fort Worth, Texas. Fain reported that Oswald

was "very difficult to interview, cold and‘ arrogant," and "on
the whole was generally uncooperative." Oswald specifically denied

that he had ever denounced his U.S. citizenship;.offered military

secrets to the Russians, or applied for Soviet citizenship. Addi-

tionally, Fain asked Oswald whether or not he would be willing to

submit to a polygraph examination as to answers given by him during
the interview. Oswald refused, and subsequently, also refused
Fain's request to take a polygraph as to “his negative answers to
the questions as to whether or not he had been providing services

or furnished any information to the Soviets or whether he had made

any deals with the Soviets in order to obtain permission to return

to the United States." Fain indicated in his report that Oswald

C. The Continued Investigation - Dallas

On September. 23, 1962, the FBI' s Wew York field office
learned | that Oswald had subscribed to "The “lorker, which Bureau
reports describe as "an East Coast communist newspaper." (Memo-
randum from SAC, Dallas, to Director, FBI, 3/25/63). SA James P.
Hosty had been assigned the pending inactive Marina Oswald case on
October 23, 1962, some five months prior to its scheduled status
review. On March 3, 1963, Hosty ascertained through a review of
I&NS records that Marina was Living at an Elsbeth Street address
in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. On March 11, 1963, Hosty was
informed by the Oswalds' landlady that she had evicted them 6n
March 3, 1963, for fighting, and his drinking. Hosty was able to
determine that the Oswald's had moved to Neely Street; he verified
this address by checking the names on the mailbox. (Memorandum from
SAC, Dallas, to-Director, FBI, 3/25/63) Hosty subsequently reviewed
the file on Lee Harvey Oswald and -- after noting that Oswald had
subscribed to the Daily Worker -- requested, on March 25, 1963, that

*- the Bureau reopen the case. Hosty also requested and received
permission to interview Oswald's wife. Lee Oswald's case was reopened
on March’ 31, 1963. (Hosty, 12/13/75, p. 119)

” On April 21, 1963, a confidential informant ‘advised the
Dallas office that Oswald was in contact with the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee in New York City, at. which time Oswald was quoted
as stating that he had passed out pamphlets for the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee (YFPCC") with a placard around his neck reading,
"Hands Off Cuba, Viva Fidel.'' (Report from Dallas Field Office to
FBI Headquarters, 9/10/63) Subsequent investigation, on May 27, 1963,
revealed, however, that the Oswalds had moved from their last known
Dallas address, and had left no forwarding address from that
residence.
D. Continued Investigation - New Orleans
By letter, dated July 17, 1963, the FBI's New Orleans
field office informed the Dallas office that it had received
‘information that the Oswalds were Living in New Orleans: This ,
information was apparently provided by the FBI's New York field
office. At Dallas’ request, the New Orleans office, on August 13,
43, verified the Oswalds’' presence in that city. (Memorandum Ce
from SAC, Dallas, to Director, FBI, 8/23/63) On September 10, 1963,
the office of origin (i.e., office of principal responsibility) for
both Lee's and Marina's cases was changed from Dallas to New Orleans.
(Memorandum from SAC, Dallas, to Director, FBI, 9/10/63).
In the interim, Oswald had been arrested in New Orleans and
charged with "disturbing the peace by creating a scene." More

specifically, while distributing FPCC literature, on August 9, 1963,

OsWald had been involved in "fight" with ER WUIE Hocnans.
On the morning of Saturday, August 10th, Oswald asked to see a Bureau
agent, and ‘he was interviewed in jail, at length, by. SA John L.
Quigley. (Report from New Orleans’ Field Office to FBI Headquarters,
8/15/63) :

On August 22, 1963, the New Orleans office was provided with a
copy of the transcript of an August 21 broadcast of a radio program
called "Conversation Carte Blanche" in “which Oswald had participated.

‘During the program, Oswald stated that the FPCC was not Communist-

if controlled and that ne SEY Marxist. On August 30, 1963, a local’
radio station manager told SA Milton R. Kaack (Oswald's case agent
in New Orleans) that after the broadcast, Oswald told him that “the
Russians had ‘gone soft' on communism, and that Cuba is the only :
real revolutionary country in the world today.'"' (Report from New

Orleans Field Office to FBI Headquarters, 10/31/63)

On August 23, 1963, the New Orleans office received a head-

quarters air telegram instructing that office to:
“ ascertain facts concerning subject’ distri-

bution of above-mentioned pamphlet including
nature of pamphlet following which’ contact

should be made with established sources

New Orleans area to determine whether

The-October 31,1963, report of SA Milton Kaack reveals that Bureau
agents in New Orleans contacted two confidential informants -- one
familiar with Cuban activities, the other “with some phases" of
Communist Party. activities in the New Orleans area ~- who advised
that they had never heard of Lee Harvey Oswald. ;

On September 24, 1963, the New Orleans field office informed
the Bureau that: “Investigation of Oswald is continuing, and a
report containing the resuits thereof will be furnished to-the.
Bureau together with the recommendation of the New Orleans office
concerning further action concerning Oswald." (Memorandum from
SAC, Dallas, to Director, FBI, 9/24/63) The subsequent New orieans
"investigation" of Oswald is set forth in SA Kaack's October 31, 1963,
investigative report encompassing the period July 23, 1963, through
October 10, 1963. The report recounts Oswald's FPCC activities, his
arrest and subsequent interview, his letters to the FPCC and The
Worker, and that the Oswalds had moved from New Orleans on or about
September 25, 1963.

The Oswalds' landlord in New Orleans had told the FBI agents
that the "same Russian speaking woman that had brought Marina to New
Orleans had picked up Marina and her child in a station wagon with
Texas license plates." Leads were sent out to Forth Worth (to attempt
to identify the woman and locate Marina), to Dallas (to attempt to
identify the voman and conduct neighborhood investigation at the

Oswald's Last known residence), and to Malvern, Arkansas (to inter-

“continue its efforts to locate subjects." (Report from New Orleans

Field Office to FBI Headquarters, 10/31/63)

On October 10, 1963, Bureau headguarters: through CIA liaison
was provided with a copy of ‘an Agency cable which stated that "Lee
Henry Oswald" had been in contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City on Septeriber 25, 1963. Further details of Oswald's contact,
including an apparent meeting with Soviet counsel Kostikov, were
provided in an October 18, 1963, cablegram from the Bureau's Leeal
Attache ["'Legat'] in Mexico City to Bureau headquarters. That Lesat
also then advised. headquarters that it was attempting ‘te establish
Oswald's entry into Mexico and his current whereabouts: A copy of
each of these communications was sent to the Hew Orleans field office
which eventually forwarded two copies on to the Dallas office.

field office's request to locate Oswald -- reviewed files at I&NS.
Although .Hosty was not able to find a new address for the Oswalds, he
did. learn from an I&NS agent of the CIA communication indicating that
Oswald had contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. (Memorandum
from SAC, Dallas, to Director, FBI, 10/22/63)

On October 22, 1963, the Bureau cabled certain general back-

ground information te the Mexico City Legat, and noted that addi-



ay

ue

tional information on Oswald was simultaneously being sent by mail.
Headquarters also advised that "Lee Henry Osivald” was apparently
identical with "Lee Harvey Oswald." (Memorandum from. Director,
FBI, to. Legat, Mexico City, 10/22/63)

On October 25, 1963, the New Orleans office learned that Oswald
had left a forwarding address in New Orleans on September 26, 1963,
showing his new address to be 2515 West Sth Street, Irving, Texas.
It asked the Dallas office to verify that this was Oswald's’ resi-
dence. (Memorandum from SAC, New Orleans, to Director, FBI, 10/25/63)

E.° “Continued Investigation: Dallas

On’ October 30, 1963, SA Hosty, through a neighborhood

pretext. interview learned that Marina Oswaid was living at the Fifth
Street address with a Mrs. Michael R. Paine. SA Hosty also learned
that although Oswald had visited his family at the Paine residence,
he was not living there. He so informed the New Orleans office on
October 31, 1963, noting that efforts to locate Oswald should be
continued. “(Memorandum from SAC, Dallas, to Director, FBI, 10/30/63)

SA Hosty then reviewed Bureau indices and checked with the
Paine's employers to “ensure that there were no subversive refer-
ences." On November 1, 1963, he proceéded to the Paine residence -
to interview Mrs. Paine. Although Mrs, Paine claimed she did not
know Oswald's home address, she informed Hosty that Oswald was
employed at the Texas School Book depository in’Dallas. (Memorandum

On November 2, 1963, Hosty by telephone verified Oswald's
employment at the Book Depository. The other field offices were
notified and instructed to discontinue efforts to locate Oswald.
lowever, Hosty was not able to verify Oswald's residence; the Book
Depository, had it listed as the Paine's address. He returned

to Soviet Embassy that hé was unable to
remain in Mexico because of Mexican visa
restriction of 15 days and that he could not
request a-new visa unless. he used his real
name,

According to informant, OSWALD had orig-
inally intended to visit Soviet Embassy in
Havana, Cuba, where he could have had time
to complete his business but could not. reach
Cuba.

The informant stated that OSWALD is
married to MARINA NICHILAYEVA OSWALD, a Soviet
citizen, and has a new daughter, AUDREY MARINA
OSWALD, born 10/20/63, Dallas, Texas.. OSWALD's
address is known to informant as Box 6225,

F. Availability of Pre-Assassination FBI Oswald Documents

to the Warren Commission

By letter, dated May 4, 1964, J. Edgar Hoover listed
and summarily described for the Warren Commission each of the sixty-
nine items that made up the Bureau's headquarters file on Lee
Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination. Although certain of the
summaries in the letter contain misleading descriptions of the

underlying documents, the Committee has not in its review

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 27


of FBI materials ‘seen. other than these sixty-nine documents in
the headquarters FBI Oswald file.* Hor has the Committee found any
indication that there were other than the usual underlying reports
in the FBI Dallas, New Orleans, and Washington, DC field office
files, the contents of which are accurately reflected in thé head-

quarters materials.**

* By letter dated October 31, 1975, the Committee requested
access to “all materials pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald that were
in FBI headquarters files at any time on or before November 22,
1963." In what we were informed was a complete response, the
Bureau produced for the Committee the sixty-nine documents summarily
described in Mr. Hoover's letter of May 4, 1964. It should again be
emphasized, however, that the Committee has not had access to FBI
files. Under the Committee's agreement with the Department of
Justice, the Committee by letter requests either “access to" or
“delivery of". FBI materials. Upon receipt of a Committee document
request’, the FBI reviews its files and produces those documents it
believes responsive to the request.

DISCUSSION: THE BUREAU'S HANDLING OF OSWALD
PRE-ASSASSINATION CASE

A. Oswald's Defection
__Upon learning on October 31, 1959 of Lee Harvey
Oswald's defection and announcement to State Department offi-
cials in the Soviet Union that he intended to provide "radar
secrets" to the Soviets, the Bureau Opened a “security case"
with Oswald as the subject. (Mémorandum from W. A. Brannigan
“to A. HE. Belmont, 11/4/ 9) The FBI then verified through inquir-
ies with the Department of the Navy that Oswald did not have
knowledge of strategic information that would benefit the Soviets.
The Bureau's stated conclusion was that, although no further
action on the case was warranted, a stop should. be placed against
Oswald's fingerprints to prevent him from entering the United
States under any name. (Memorandum from W. A. Brannigan, 11/4/59)
Some six months later the Bureau interviewed Oswald's
mother. They were informed that Oswald had taken his birth
certificate with him to the Soviet Union; by memorandum dis-
seminated to the State Department, the Bureau expressed con-
cern that an imposter might attempt to return to the United
States using Oswald's identity. (Report from Dallas Field

Office to FBI Headquarters, 5/12/60).

B. Qswald's Return to the United States

‘Despite the Bureau's expressed concern that an imposter
might attempt to return to the United States using Oswald's
identity, the FBI did not interview Oswald until some thiee |
weeks. subsequent to his return to the United States on June 13,
1962. . Oswald was interviewed at the dock. by I&NS Inspector
Frederick Weidersheim: (Memorandum from SAC, New York to
Director, FBI, 6/26/62) There is no- indication that either
Inspector Weidersheim, or the FBI agents assigned. to the Dallas
field office who interviewed Oswald were ever alerted to the
possibility that an imposter might attempt to assume Oswald's
identity. indeed, SA James P. Hosty, Jr. testified that he had
neither seen a copy of the memorandum which raised the imposter
possibility, nor attempted to determine whether someone had in.

fact assumed Oswald's identity. (Hosty, 12/12/75, p. 75)

on June 26, 1962, SA's John John W. Fain and B. Tom Carter
interviewed Oswald in Fort Worth, Texas. According to 'SA

Fain's report, Oswald was cold, arrogant, and difficult to inter-
view. With copies of State Department documents in hand, Fain
was aware that despite Oswald's denials he had stated to State

‘Department officials at the American Embassy in Moscow that he

Gb

(1) was going to renounce his American citizenship,

i

for Soviet citizenship, and (3) reveal radar secrets to the Soviets.*
Indeed, SA Fain asked Oswald to take a polygraph test; Oswald
refused. to be polygraphed, even as to his negative answers on

deals or relationships with Soviet intelligence. (Report from

Dallas Field Office to FBI Headquarters, 7/10/62.)**

SA Fain also reported that Oswald denied that he had ever been

a member of the Communist Party in,the United States, or that

he went to the Soviet Union because "of a lack of sympathy for

the institutions of the United States." {Report from Dallas Field
Office to FBI Headquarters, 7/10/62) ;

A second interview some three weeks later on August 16, 1962,
went much the game way. Despite Oswald's attitude and demon-
strable lies, SA Fain closed the Oswald security case on August 20,
1962; it was not to be reopened until March 26, 1963. (Hosty,
12/13/75, .p. 119) :

The only additional investigation of Oswald conducted by
the Bureau at any time prior to March 26, 1963, were the reviews
of the Oswald file at the Department of State, inquiring of two

low-level Dallas Communist Party informants whether they knew

questioning by Commission members Ford and Dulles as to the dis-

crepancies in Oswald's statements, and-Fain'!s reaction to them. eT,

Oswald's relatives. Despite the extensive use of sources and
techniques to develop background information on subjects of
security cases, no neighborhood or employment sources were
checked or developed in-Oswald's ease, Marina was not inter-
viewed, and none of the Bureau's established techniques to
determine with whom a person was in contact -- such as the tail
cover -- were employed or their use even suggested.*

The Bureau's failure to interview Marina prior to the
assassination is surprising. The documentary record reflects
that Marina's case was opened in a pending inactive status, i.e.,
although the file was not technically closed, nothing was to
be done in the case for six months. Marina Oswald had originally
been considered for a Bureau, program which monitored the
activities of Sovict immigrants and Fepatriates who met
criteria which suggested that they might have .
intelligence ties. Mowever the Dallas field of fice

supervisor concluded on July 25, 1962, that consideration of Marina for
. : bees
this program would’be postponed for six months im—thet her activities

could be sufficiently monitored in connection with the subversive

case on Lee Oswald. As previously noted, the case on Lee
Oswald was closed on August 20, 1962. (Memorandum from SAC, Dallas

to Director, FBI, 8/25/63)

* The Committee is neither suggesting that’ these techniques

should have been employed nor that their use would have been pro-
per. It is merely noting that its review of other FBI security

files reflects that’ such sources and techniques were extensively
used in cases similar to Oswald's

“ With respect to Oswald's marriage to Marina, and her
return to the United States; the Commission stated:

Oswald's marriage to Marina Prusakova on

April 30, 1961, is itself a fact. meriting
consideration. _A foreigner living in Russia
cannot marry without. the permission: of the
Soviet Government. It seems unlikely. that

the Soviet authorities’ would have permitted
Oswald to marry and to take his wife with

him to the United States if they were con-
templating using him alone as an agent. The
fact that he had a Russian wife would be Likely,
in their view, to increase any surveillance
under which he would be kept by American secur-
ity agencies, would make him.even more conspic-
uous to his neighbors as "an ex-Russian", and
would decrease his mobility. A wife's pre-
sence in the United States would also constitute
a-continuing risk of disclosure. On the other
hand, Marina Oswald's lack of English training
and her complete ignorance of the United States
and its customs would. scarcely recommend her to
the Soviet authorities as one member of an
"agent team" to be. sent to the United States

on a difficult and dangerous foreign enterprise.

(Warren Commies€Gh Report, p. 274.)

In contradistinction, a retired Bureau Soviet Section Supervisor
told the Committee that of greatest concern.to him in the Oswald
case was the fact that the Soviets had allowed Marina to return

to the United States with Oswald. He felt that if they desired

mjto “tap Oswald on the shoulder and make use of him at some
future date, Marina's presence would give them a great deal of

leverage.", (Staff_interview with former FBI Headquarters Super-

On September 28, 1962, the New York field office.learned --

and subsequently informed Dallas -- that Oswald subscribed to.

The Worker. Oswald's subseription to this newspaper” ~

contradicted his ‘interview statements that he was
“disenchanted with the Soviet. Union" and "not out of sympathy

with U. S. institutions." (Report from Dallas Field Office to
FBI Headquarters, 9/10/63)* The fact of Oswald's subscription
was simply, noted-in his. security file; FBI headquarters was not
informed of .the subscription until September 10, 1963, and then
only after it had requested information on Oswald from the Dallas
office. (Report from Dallas Field Office to.FBI Headquarters, 9/10/63)
Assistant FBI Director Gale of the Inspection Division, in

his December 10, 1963, highly critical report on the Buneau's
handling of the pre-assassination Oswald case noted: “In light
of Oswald's defection, the case should have been ‘reopened at
the first indication of Communist ‘sympathy or activity."
(Memorandum from J. H. Gale to Tolson, 12/10/63) **

In October of 1962, SA Hosty had been assigned the Marina
Oswald security case, which remained at that time ina pending
imactive status. The case was reviewed by Hosty for the
first time in March of 1963, at which time he located Marina
Oswald, but did not interview her because of her alleged

there was no indication of repentence but only one of openly avowed
hostility,.and contacts with subversive clements." (Memorandum from

however, review the Dallas Office's security file on Lee
Oswald and, on the basis of Oswald's subscription to The Worker,
requested (and subsequently received) approval to open the case
on March 26, 1963. (Hosty, 12/18/75, pel)

With respect to Hosty's stated reason for not interviewing
Marina -- i.e., in that he had developed information that Oswald
had been drinking to excess and beating. his wife, the relevant
FBI manual provision required that_he ‘allow a “cooling off" period --
Mr. -Hoover commented on the December 10, 1963 Gale memorandum that
"this.was certainly an asinine excuse"! and "I just don't understand

such solicitude." Inspector | Gale had ‘written that
t

“this entire facet of the investigation was

mishandled. “Mrs. Oswald definitely should

have been interviewed and the best time to

_get information from her would be after she

was beaten up by her husband. *
The Director added the following notation next to Gale's conclusion:
"This certainly makes sense." (Memorandum from J. H. Gale to
Tolson, 12/10/63)

On April 21, 1963, the New York ‘field office was informed
that Oswald had written a letter to the FPCC. This is the first
indication in Bureau files that Oswald had a relationship with
this pro-Castro organization. (Report from Dallas Field Office
to FBI Headquarters, 9/10/63) Oswald then’wrote that he had
passed out FPCC literature in Dallas'with a placard around his

neck reading "Hand[{s] Off Cuba - Viva Fidel." This information

from J. H. Gale to Tolson, 12/10/63) and not reported to héad-
quarters until September 10, 1963. (Report from ‘Dallas Field
Office to FBI Headquarters, 9/10/63) Once again, Oswald's

activities appear to contradict his interview statements.

On May 27, 1963, Hosty returned to the Oswald's Neely
Street residence to interview Marina, and was informed
that the Oswalds had moved fromthe Dallas area without leaving
“a forwarding address. Pursuant to leads sent out by the Dallas
office seeking information on the Oswalds' whereabouts, the
New Orleans office informed Dallas on July 17, 1963, that the
Oswalds were living in that city. (Memorandum from SAC, Dallas
to Director, FBI, to SAC, New Orleans, 8/23/63) The Bureau
apparently learned of Oswald's presence in New Orleans from a
letter he had written to The Worker on June 26, 1963. Oswald
claimed in the letter to be a long-time subscriber and stated
that: he was forming an. FPCC chapter in New Orleans. He enclosed
honorary membership cards for "those fighters for peace." Mr.
Gus Hall (General: Secretary of the Communist Party, USA) and
Benjamin Davis (National Secretary of the Community Party, USA).
(Réport from New Orleans Field Office to FBI Headquarters,

D. = The Continued Investigation -- New Orleans

In the interim, Oswald had on August 9, 1963, been arrested

in New Orleans in’ connection with his FPCC activities and

’ charged with “disturbing the peace by creating a scene." On

“the morning of Saturday, August 10, Oswald asked to see a

Bureau agent, and he was interviewed at length by SA Quigley.
Oswald also repeatedly lied to this FBI agent. For example, he
told. Quigley that he had met and martied his wife. in Fort Vorth,
Texas. ‘(Report from New Orleans’ Field Office to FBI lWeadquarters,
8/15/63) ;

The New Orleans office learned on August 22, .1963, that
Oswald participated in a radio program in his capacity as the
secretary of the New Orleans FPCC chapter, and stated, among other
things, ‘that he was a Marxist and that "Cuba is the only real
revolutionary country in the world today." (Report from. New
Orleans Field office to FBI Headquarters, 10/31/63, p. 11)

On August 23, 1963, the New Orleans office was instructed by head-
quarters to “submit results of their Oswald investigation to the
Bureau." (Memorandum from Director, FBI, to SAC, New Orleans,
8/23/63) On September 24, 1963, the New Orleans office advised
the Bureau that the investigation was continuing and that a
report setting forth the investigative findings would be furn-
ished (Memorandum ‘from SAC, New Orleans, to FBI Headquarters,

any significant information that was not already in Oswald's

in the New Orleans area -- one familiar with Cuban activity --

were asked about Oswald. . Neither informant had heard of him

(Report from New Orleans Field Office to FBI Headquarters,

10/31/63)

On or about. October 2, 1963, agents of ‘the New Orleans
office attempted to ascertain Oswald's residence and place of
employment. They, learned that the Oswalds had left New Orleans.
Leads to locate Lee Harvey Oswald were sent to Dallas, Fort
Worth, and Malvern, Arkansas. (Report from New Orleans Field
Office to FBI Headquarters, 10/31/63)

The evidence indicates that Lee Harvey Oswald was in Mexice
City from September 27, 1963, through October 4, 1963. On
October 10, 1963, Bureau headquarters through CIA liaison was
provided with a copy of an Agency cable which stated that "Lee
Henry Oswald" had been in contact with the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico- City on September 28, 1963. (CIA Cable from Mexico City

C. The CIA's Role in’ the Investizatih

1. Nature of CIA's Investigation

Except for the requests from the Warren Commission, CIA
received no written instructions to aonduct an investigation. Unlike
FBI; CIA was not directed by the President to undertaké. ari active in-
vestigation; President Johnson only instructed Diréctor McCone to
make CIA Hesources available to FBI in order to assist FBI's
investigation. : ,

Nevertheless, as-news of the assassination sptead on
Novembér 22, CIA stations began reporting to CIA Headquarters any
information they received that. appeared td have evén the remotest
connéction to the. assassitiation. Of course, information from Mexico
city WAS of paramount importance to ciA Haadquarters since the
station there had reported Oswald's contact with the Soviet Cansulate
only two months earlier. Headquarters analyzed these reports and
for several weeks after the assassination closely ‘fdliowed the
situation in Mexico City, ordering the station to investigate various
allegations and to follow certain leads. :

After the Warren. Commission was establisted and after it
was clear FBI had principal responsibility for investigating the
assassination, CIA's work gradually shifted from the kind of active
iivestigation it had béen condtcting in Mexico City to one of
responding to requéSts from, or passing along information to. the

Warren Commission or the FBI.

foreign leaders was first acknowledged publicly in the course of
the Rockefeller Commission's investigation and was confirmed by
the Senate Select Committee's investigation and report

The Rockefeller Commission investigated both CIA assassination
plets and their connection with the Warren Commission investigation.
David Belin, a staff attorney for the Warren Commission and Chief
Courisel for the Rockéfeller Commission, wrote:

At no time did the CIA disclosé to the Warret

Commission any facts whith pertained to alleged

assassination plans to kill Fidel Castro; (Memor~_

{T]he CIA withheld from the Warreri Commi ssidu

information which mig havé beén relevant

contact between Oswald and agents of the Cuban
government.

Mr. Belin also discussed this matter with Rayinond Rocca;
Chief; Régearch and Analysis, Counterintelligence Division, cia,
who was the “point of record betwéeti the CIA did the warren
Commission. Mr. Rocca, like Mr. Belin, prepared a memoratdun
stating Hé was unaware of the plots until 1975 and expressing soncern
about che Warren Commission's findings in light of this new ihforma-
tion.

Mr. Beliri also contacted formér Watren Commission staff
counsel, Burt Griffin, to get his views on this matter. Mr Griffin
responded by letter wherein he expressed his feelings that
assassination plots against Castro might have a significant effect ‘

on the Watren Commission findings.

* Mr. Rankin, Geuerdl Counsel of the Warren Commission, also
advised the Committee he was not aware of the CIA's assassination
plots until 1975.

Dockd:32423526 Page 44

Moreover. the Select Conmittee has, previously. a nélad

inderway in the Fall of 1963 and that the plot involved the passing

of a poisén pen to a Cuban agent on the very day of Presidént Kénnedy's
assassination. Because of the chronological relationship of this

plot to the assassination of President Kennedy, the Select Comhiittee
investigated whether there were other connections between the plot and
President Kennedy's assassination.

a. . Background of Assassination Plots: Covert Actions Against

: Fidel Castro's forces took Sveti the government of Cuba.
on January 1, 1959. Although initially advocating teform through
socialism, Castro soon openly advocated comminism and aligned hiniself
with the Soviet Bloc. Thé United States was properly concérned with
Castro's change in direction, not merely because a Soviet aligned
tegime in Cuba poséd a threat to U.S. security, but also because
Castéé seemed bent on exporting communist revolution throughout. Latin
America.

Ag a result; the United States embarked on a pdlicy
looking ‘to thé ouster of Castro and his comminist regime. Imp lenienta-
tion of this policy concerned ali appropriate governinent ageticies +-
the Departments of State, Justité, atid Defense included. ‘The CIA was
given prineipal vesponsibility for implementation cf thé policy through
covert action. . 5

works, sabotage of facilities, defection of Cuban officials, out
right invasion in. the case of the Bay of Pigs, and coup planning and
assassination. In addition to these operations directiy controlléd
by CIA, there were various operations run by Cuban exiles.

Two major exile groups, referred to by the CIA as

“autonomous operations," were assisted by CIA and were controlled as
well as could be by CIA. The CIA therefore had files on many of

those invdived with the two autonomous groups. As will be discussed
infra, this meant that even though many members were living in the
Uriited States and ostensibly within the jurisdiction of the FBI; not the
cTA, the CTA could have assigted Watren Commission invastigatére in
tinderstanding Oswald's Cuban connections.

Thus, the Warrén Commissicti's investigation cf the

assaséination of President Kennedy was conducted against a’ background
of CIA's covert’ operations against Cuba. Knowladge of these opérations
was rélevdht both to the Commission's Gonclusions aboiit foreign con-
spitacias and to its investigation of Oswald's connections to pro-
Castro arid anti-Castro organizations. :

b. The AMLASH Oeration and Casttd's. Knowledgé of It

Without doubt; Fidel castio had good reasdi to fear U.S.

policy urider President Kennédy: Keniiady Had permitted thé abdrtive Bay
of Pigs invasion and had threaténed ficledt war over Soviet placement
of nucledr weapons in Cuba. His adtiinistration constantly focused on
the custér of the Castro regime. ;

certainly noticed no difference between Kennedy's WHE

those which might be adopted by Senator Goldwater, his likely opponent
in the 1964 election. For example, in a report of an impromptu interview
on Septémmber 7, 1963, AP correspondent Daniel Barker reported:

Castro then launched into a4 discussion of the U.S:.

political scene saying he expects no change in

Washington's foreign policy even if there is a

change in administrations after the 1964 presidential

élections. "I am sure it will -be a fight between

Castro said. . .3/ 7

: After the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis, CIA's
covért operations, then designated as Project Mongoose, wete halted
on Octobér 30, 1962. ‘ Castro seemed to be aware of this decision in
his November 1963 interview with the reporter Jean Daniel.

On the ether hand; raids by Cuban exile groups could not be
so éasil¥ controlled. However, after exile raiding boats fired on
a Russian ship off the coast of Cuba in Spring 1963, the FBT,
reportedly acting on Robert Kennedy's orders, started 4 crack-down
cn thé U:S. based operations of the exilé groups. Mechanisms #ére
devised; however, to avoid FBI ¢rack-down on the CIA operations. .

In June 1963, a decision was reached to step up various
cévert operations dpainst Cuba, including sabotags operations designed
to encourage dissident groups inside Cuba, to worsen economic ¢ondi-

tions i the country, and to cause Cubans to doubt the ability of the

Castro ‘regime to defend the country.

Perhaps this decision prompted CIA to renew contact with
a highly placed Cuban, code-named AMLASH, who previously had
indicated interest in assassinating Castro and in toppling the
regime. ;
In late August 1963, AMLASH was in Brazil and there met with
CIA case officers. Although before this meeting CIA's interest in
AMLASH may have been to gain intelligencé and to ctiltivate him as an
asset fdr covert operations, the case officers learned that AMLASH
himself was interested primarily in attempting an “inside Job" against
Castro and was aWaiting a U.S. plan of Action, A message from CIA.
Headquarters analyzed the contatt by Siiggesting AMLASH did not
séém intérested in routine intelligence missions and should be dir-
ected toward recruiting cohorts for sabotage and “more serious
matters on an orderly basis.": The case officer testified he was
aware of this analysis. ‘
There is no direct évidence that Castro was aware of
thesé meetings with CIA, but there is veason to believé hé wad:
Shortly after the meeting, CIA received information
from another source to the effect that Castro was aware of AMLASH'¢
general sentiments. The case officer éould not tecali receiving this
information, but he knew that AMLASH had been rather openly anti-
communist: ,
: More importantly, on Septéinber 7, 1973, Castro gave an

improniptu threé hour interview with AP téporter Daniel Harker and

warned agaiast the U.S. “aiding terrorist plaris to eliminate Cuban

as the occasion for his tirade. The connection between Castio's
- . *

warning and the AMLASH meeting may only be coincidental. Nevertheless,
AMLASH had proposed.a terrorist plan to eliminate Cuban leaders}
and, according to an informal briefing by a current CYA analyst of
Cuban affairs, Castro is prone to resort-to subtle nuances, such
as the choice of the Brazilian Embassy,-to put his statements in
context.

Similarly Mr. Récea has céneluded: "There can be no
question from the Facts sutrotriding the Castra appearance, which
had not been expected, and his agreément to the inkerviéw, that this -
évent répresented a more-thén-ordinety attempt to gét 4 tiessagé én’
thé récord in the United States." (Nemotandum for DC/OPS, May 23,
1975.)

According to Harker, Castro went on to say the "United
States ieaders would be in danger if they helped in any attempt to
do awdy with leaders of Cuba . .. We ate prepared to fight: them and
atiswet in kind: ‘United States leaders should think that if they
are aiding térrorist plans to eliminate Gubah ‘Leaders, they

Such raids, however, would not seem to justify Castro's
threat: Objectively the raids ¢annot be considered "plans to eliminate
Cuban leaders." AMLASH's proposal was, The raids would not

him everything he needed (telescopic sight, silencer,

that President Kennedy had béen assassinated: Because
of this fact, plans with subject changed and it was de-
Gided that this. Agency eéuld have no part it the assassi-
nation of a government leader (including Castro) and
it would not aid subject in his attempt. THis included
the following. "We would not furnish the silencer, nor
scope, nor any money for dirétk assassination;

: furthermore, we would not lift a. finger to help subjéct

escape from Cuba should he agsassinate Castro.

The case officer took exception to thé statements of
fact edrtained in rhis document. First, he pointed out Fitzgerald
wa fot at the November. 22 meeting, but was in’tead in Washington.
After repeated questions, he finally denied he had given AMLASK the
assuvance of “all the money he wanted:"" He testified AMLASH never
asked for money. He and Fitzgerald had, however, assured. AHLASH
of all the support he needed; and money could be considered part
of that support.

The case officer said he and Fitegerald never discussed
a connection between. thé AMLASH operation arid the assassination of
President Kennedy. Therefore, he thought the document's statement
that plans changed because of Kenriedy's assassination does not
ateurately describe the situation. He further said that there was
ne assiixance, to aid AMLASH'S escape. The case officer felt the
document was a summary drawn from the AMLASH file; attributing

as an assassination plot. No other ‘docunients mention escape plans

quoted portions of this 1965 document were cut out of whole cloth.
Arid; if he ig correct, many at the Agency, who had later responsi-
bility for at least .a portion of the opération, were acting on very
erréneousg information if they relied on this document

Two other events occurring in the October-ilovember 1963
time period deserve mention in this discussion of U.8.-Cuban
rélations. The first is that talks betvieeh the Cuban délegate to
thé UN, La Chuga, and a U.S. delegate, William Atwood, were proposed
by the Ctibans on Septémber 5. After discussions about the. lecation for
such taiks and Atwood's expressions of U.S. interest, La Chuga told
Atwood Gr October 28 that "Havana dign't see exactly hov a talk
vould be useful now; but he would be glad to maintain continious
contact." Oi November 29, La Chuga again’ inqiiired of Atwood about
U.S: intérest in talks. aa

Sécondly, the FrencH repetter, jean Daniel, had a brief
interview with President Kennedy on October 24 before setting off on
ait assignment in Cuba. At that meeting, the President expressed his
feeling that Castro had betrayed the revolution. "

Daniel travelled to Cuba but got no hint of a similar
meeting with Castro. Then on November 19, the dav after the Presi-

report of this meeting “When Castro heard the News" describes
Castro's reaction to word of the assassination. Significantly,
after word of Johnson's succession to the Presidency reached Castro,
he asked: "What authority does he exercise over the CIA?"

O£ course Castro was well aware of the U.S. program
of covert operations against Cuba: In public Speeches; he repeatedly
attacked CIA operations; although he rarely distinguished between
CIA operations and‘ those of exile groups operating on their own.
Président Kennedy's speech of November 18 would have reinforced
his belief that the U.S. was committed to his overthrow.

The Select Committee attempted to determine whether Castro
had actual knowledge of the AMLASH operation either because AMLASH
himself was a double agent or because Cubdn/Soviét penetration of
the CIA's Cuban operations would have given him such information.

This brief investigation has not yielded a definitive
answer. ‘However, the following facts indicate astro could have
known of the operation. First, Castro's Statement on September 7

‘indicate the U.S. was pogsibly

that “events of ‘the last few days’
aiding terrorist groups’ plans to elimindté the leaders of the

employees of a Cuban Embassy suspected AMLASH was on sétte Top Secret

business. Fourth, CIA learned that Cuban Embassy employees wete

Knowledge of covert operations generaliy must be dis
tinguished from knowledge of specific operations. The members and
btatt 6£ the Warren Commission knew. Kennedy's policy toward Cuba
and knew CIA was involved. Allen Dullés; a member of the Warren
commission and former DCL, was completely familiar with operations
conducted until his departure from the CIA in November 1961. He
could have assumed that those operations continued.

The more difficult questioh is who knew of assassination
attempts against Castro and who knew of details of the AMLASH
opération. ‘John MeCone, then DCI, had been briefed about Previous |
assassination plots but denied knowledge of the AMLASH opetation.
Allen Dulles probably knew CIA had engaged in past attempts to kill
Castro but there is no reason to believe he krew of the AMLASH

operation.

* McCone testified he “had not related" assassination plots
agdinst Ca8tro involving the Mafia with Kennedy's assassination.
MeCone further testified that Allen Dulles was in a position to
brief the Warren Commission generally on "any activities in the
CIA" that might have been relevant to the investigation.

Allen Dulles, my predecessor; was a member of the
Warren Commission, and it seeined only natural

that if there were any activiti in the CIA

“The Select Committee's interim Report "Alleged Assassination

Plots Involving Foreign Leaders" discusses at length who knew of
CIA's assassination plots against Castro. So far as has been
determined knowledge of plots involving the Mafia were known by
a number of government officials outside CIA. For example, Hoover
prepared a memorandum dated May 10, 1962, in which he recounted a
private meeting he had with Attorney General Kennedy that day.
Hoover noted: ,

Maheu had been hired by CIA to approach Gian-

canna with a proposition of paying $150,000

to hire some gunman to go into Cuba and kill

Castro. He. further stated that CIA admitted

having assisted Maheu in making the bugging

of Las Vegas.
A copy of this memorandum was disseminated to Messrs. Tolson,
Belmont, Evans, Sullivan, and DeLoach. Although these senior
Bureau officials were in various capacities involved in the assass-
ination investigation, the Committee has uncovered no evidence that
the Warren Commission was ever informed of these plots, There is no
indication in the documentary record made available to the Committee
which even suggests that any Bureau official considered these plots
in connection with the assassination. Indeed, FBI documents do
not again reference these plots until February 1967

However, there is no evidence that the AMLASH operation --

far more relevant to thé Kennedy assassination than these earlier

plots because it was underway in Fall 1963 -- was known outside CIA.

* Similarly, CIA and FBI materials reviewed by the Committee do
not reflect that the Bureau ever inquired during the course of the
assassination investigation as to the details of the agencies’ Castro
assassination plots or, more specifically, whether such plots were

of President Kennedy's speeches as an indication of Kennedy's

was relevant to Kennedy's assassination. _ ew £
~ Questioned why he did not think ‘it important to give
material about assassination plots to the Warren Commission, Helms
indicated the Commission could have relied on public knowledge that
the United States wanted "to get rid of Castro."

I don't recall that I was either instructed

or it occurred to me to cover with the Warren

Commission the precise details of the Agency's

operations not because I made-a significant

judgment not to do this, but . . . -my recollec-

tion at the time was that it was public knowledge that

the United States was trying to get rid of Castro. -*/

Helms’ assumption that early covert actions against Cuba

which included assassination attempts "must have occurred to!
(Dulles)" is paradoxical to Helms’ inability to recollect whether a
1963 plot which he authorized and which had a least chronological
relevance to Kennedy's.assassination "occurred" to him. When
questioned why, in both positions of liaison with the Warren
Commission and DDP, Helms did not inform the Warren Commission,
Helms narrowly defined his position with the Warren Commission,

Sen: Morgan. .. . (in 1963) you were not...

just an employee of the CIA. You were in the to

echelon, the management level were you net?

Helms. Yes, I was Senator Morgan

plot against Castro?

Helms. I was aware that there had been efforts made to
get rid of him by these means.

Sen. Morgan. . . . you were charged with furnishing the
Warren Commission information from the CIA, information
that you thought was relevant?

Helms. No sir, I was instructed to reply to inquiries from
the Warren Commission for information from the Agency. I

was not asked to initiate any particular thing.

Sen.:Morgan. . . . in other words (if) you weren't
asked for it, you didn’t give it.

Helms, That's right, sir.

. Both Helms and the case officer who met AMLASH have
testified that no relationship existed between the AMLASH operation
and the Kennedy assassination. Both.seemed to suggest: there was
no reason for informing the Warren Commission about the operations
-- the thought never crossed their minds. Helms testified as follows:

Q. Now, after President: Kennedy was assassinated in
November 1963, and after it became known to you that

the individual, Lee Harvey Oswald, was believed very
breadly to have done the shooting, that Oswald had had some
activity in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee :

did you hold any conversations with anybody about the
possibility that the assassination of President Kennedy
was a retaliation by Oswald against the activity, the talks
and plans to assassinate Castro? :

A. No. fI don't recall discussing that with anybody. 1
don't recall the thought ever having occurred to me at the
time. The first time I ever heard such theory as that
enunciated was in a very peculiar way by President Johnson

Q. ‘Iam not asking you about a story, Ambassador. I

am asking you whether or not there was a relationship
between Oswald's contacts with the: Cubans and his support
for the Castro government, his attempts in September

1963 to get a passport to Cuba, to travel to Cuba, his
attempts to penetrate anti-Castro groups. Did the connec-
tion ever enter your mind?

A. I don't recall its having done so.

about any Link between the AMLASH operation and Kennedy's assassination;

however, he also testified he assumed that after the November 22
meeting with AMLASH the ‘whole Cuban operation was going to be
*

reassessed after what happened to President Kennedy."

Questioned if he ever made any link in his own mind
between the AMLASH operation and the Kennedy assassination, the AMLASH
case officer replied "none whatsoever" and suggested "that all the

; public theories" have distortedthe context of ‘the 1963 AMLASH

operation. The Case Officer insisted the AMLASH operation was
not an assassination plot and therefore there would be no reason
to make any connections:

I have to preface what I have to say by saying

that (the AMLASH operation) was not an assassina-
tion plot, so there would be no reason why we

would be connecting Kennedy's assassination with
this assassination plot. (AMLASH operation) was

not an assassination plot, it was not conceived as
an assassination plot . . . so there was really

in the context of the time the fact that this was
not an assassination plot conceived as an assassination
plot, there was really no reason to connect this one
particular operation with the tragedy of President
Kennedy.

* AMLASH Case Officer Testimony, 2/11/76, p. 76

**AMLASH Case Officer Testimony, 2/11/76, p. 87. With regard to his
reference to "public theories," it is interesting to note the

he now know that Oswald was pro-Castro.

standing, it-does not seem credible that those at CIA knowledgeable
of the operation did not at least suspect there might be a relation-
ship. Furthermore, there is some’ evidence to suggest that affirmative
actions may have been taken to prevent those investigating the
assassination from learning of the AMLASH operation. ,
For example,.CIA files on AMLASH contain only the
briefest report of the November 22 meeting with AMLASH. The case
officer identified the document in the file as the report he prepared,
but he could not explain why the type of the third page is dramatically
lighter than that on the first.two pages. He explained its failure
to mention the poison pen device by saying Fitzgerald probably
ordered him to avoid mention of it in the report. Indeed, although
the case officer's testimonyestablished the facts about the device, no
existing document at CIA except for the 1967 1.G. Report, mentions it
Moreover, there is the documentary evidence, contradicted by
the case officer's testimony, that CIA terminated the AMLASH operation
specifically because of the Kennedy assassination. The 1967 1.G. Report
and the case officer's testimony before the Select Committee point
to the existence of a cable from CIA Headquarters to the case officer
on the morning of November 23, ordering the case officer to break off
contact with AMLASH and return to Headquarters. Neither the staff
of the Committee nor the staff of the E.G. in 1967 could locate this
cable. The contents of such a cable might support the previously
referenced 1965 summary of the AMLASH operation, which states the
AMLASH "situation changed" when it was learned the President had been

assassinated.

Furthermore, the organization of CIA's investigation of the
assassination and ‘its work with the Warren Commission precluded dis-
closure of the AMLASH operation. The case officer testified he knew
of no CIA ‘investigation of a connection between the AMLASH operation
and the assassination.

The AMLASH operation was the responsibility of the Special

Affairs Staff headed by Desmond Fitzgerald. Although Mr. Fitz-
gerald was nominally within the Western Hemisphere Division of the
DDP and so answered to the head of that Division, J. C. King,
Mr. Fitzgerald often worked directly with Mr. Helms especially on
sensitive projects. For example, minutes of White House meetings
in 1964 on Cuban operations show Mr. Fitzgerald's presence but not
Mr. King's.

Evidence available to the Select Committee is conflicting as
to what Mr. King knew of the Cuban operations and assassination plots.
The case officer did not know if Mr. King knew; but it seems fair to
assume. that Mr. King did not know of the AMLASH operation. For example,
in a February 4, 1964 memorandum to AMLASH's case officer, King
itemized intelligence requirements for AMLASH. This at least suggests
that King was unaware of the September 1963 decision not to use
AMLASH for intelligence and suggests he was unaware of the AMLASH
operation. The case officer did not feel such a conclusion can be
reached merely from the memorandum, but he did not recall receiving it.

In any event the staff of SAS apparently was not put in direct
contact with the Warren Commission. Mr. Angleton testified that “point

of record" for the Warren Commission's contact with CIA was Mr.

HW 50955 DocId:32423526 Baye 63


Raymond Rocca of Angleton's staff. Rocca described himself as
chief_of research for matters of interest to the Warren Commission --
primarily Oswald's defection to Russia. Rocca had a staff of three
whe assisted him in research. One conducted research on the Soviet
services. . Another followed all FBI developments forwarded to CIA.

And another handled Oswald's relationship to the DeMohrenschildts (a

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 64


a
couple close to Oswald who were part of the Russian community oe
Dallas) and he followed overt references to Oswald and the Soviet
services.

Rocea said the Mexico City aspects of the investigation were
handled by Mr. King and his desk chief, Mr. Jack Whitten, the latter
usually reporting directly to Mr. Helms. ‘Helms, according to Rocca,
was the major liaison with the Warren Commission and conducted any
negotiation with Dulles or Rankin.

Consequently, SAS was not involved in the day-to-day work on
the assassination although, according to Angleton, it might respond
to requests from Helms or Rocca. Thus, except for Helms, CIA
personnel knowledgeable of the AMLASH operation were not in direct
contact with the Warren Commission.

However, SAS, it would seem, was the most logical office to
be working on the.case in view of the fact that Oswald's activities
since at least August 1963 had revolved around Cuba. For instance,
he headed a one-man Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans.

The FBI report of this sent to CIA was routed first to SAS, Counterin-

telligence on November 15, 1963. Oswald attempted to join, and then

argued with, members of an anti-Castro group. The CIA received a
message about this on November 22, 1963, through SAS from the WAVE
station in Miami. CIA's response to the staff request for WAVE's files
on Oswald was that there are none.

Indeed, the whole question of Cuban intelligence's role in the
assassination could only have been analyzed by SAS's counterintelli-
gence division -- a self-contained counterintelligence operation that
was not under Mr, Angleton, CIA Chief of Counterintelligence.

Whether intentional or not, CIA's exciusion of SAS from day-to-
HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 65 .

significance, for it denied the Warren Commission ready access to

the CIA division with the most direct knowledge of both pro-Castro and
anti-Castro activities, of the activity of Cuban intelligence, and

of CIA's work with a high-level Cuban who planned to assassinate Castro.

Finally, on a document which apparently is a biography of AMLASH
and which mentions his contact with CIA is written, "Dec 1963, Not to
leave this officer per [the case officer's] orders.*' All documents
in this file are filed chronologically and this document appears with
others bearing a December 1963 date. It probably was the top document
in the AMLASH file in December 1963.

The case officer testified that he did not recall giving such an
order and he did not think such an order unusual. He testified that
Fitzgerald indicated the AMLASH operation was very sensitive. Never-
theless, he conceded that a request for the file would, by virtue. of
this order, requiré that he be consulted before the file could be given
out. It certainly seems possible that the order was given because
Rocea and others investigating the assassination were requesting SAS
files.

Indeed, CIA personnel working on the investigation of Kennedy's
assassination were almost immediately concerned with the connection be-
tween Oswald and KGB and other Soviet personnel in Mexico City. On
November 24, Mexico City station cabled all known contacts of certain
Soviet personnel there. Among those contacts mentioned in the cable
was AMLASH. Since all such names were presumably traced through CIA
files, it seems likely that CIA personnel . investigating the assassina-

tion would have requested all files on AMLASH.

MW 5U955 Dockd:32423526 Page 66


of course, there are no documents indicating such a request was made
or indicating the AMLASH file was turned over to CIA investigators
However, from the handwriting on the top document in the AMLASH file,

one may infer that the investigators did not receive his file.

3, Mexico City Investigation

On September 25, 1963, Oswald left New Orleans by bus and
travelled to Mexico City, arriving there at 10:00 a.m. on Friday
September 27. He left Mexico City on the morning of October 2
and travelled by bus to Dallas area, where he lived until the
assassination. ;

After the assassination, intensive investigation by the FBI
and by Mexican authorities produced little information about
Oswald's activities while in Mexico City. The investigation
determined the bus he took, the passengers on the buses (whom the
FBI interviewed), his arrival and departure times, and the hotel
he stayed in. One person interviewed by the FBI recalled seeing

Oswald at the hotel when he left for Dallas and another saw him eating

lunch at a restaurant near the hotel. Otherwise, all information

about. Oswald's activities in Mexico City has come from the CIA
and from documents furnished by the Cuban government to the Warren
Commission. Thus, although Oswald spent about five and a half
days in Mexico City, CIA was thé principal source of information
about his activities there.

On the surface, the information only indicated Oswald was in
Mexico City. to obtain a visa to Russia with a stop-over in Cuba --
travel requiring he obtain the approval of both governments.

it was this information which brought Oswald to CIA attention
before ‘the assassination.

On October 8, 1963, the Mexico Station relying on this information
reported to headquarters that Lee Oswald had been in contact with
the Soviet consulate.

Later in October, CIA Headquarters passed this information

with some background material from its files to the Navy, State
Department and FBI; and ‘the Mexico Station made a similar distribu-
tion, including the background information it received from Head-
quarters, to liaison contacts in Mexico City. Passing this informa-
tion to these three agencies ended CIA's responsibility in the matter.

Since Oswald was an American citizen and since FBI was the responsible

agency, there seemed to be nothing further CIA could do.

-the CLA did obtain photographs of an American~looking male, in
Mexico City at the time Oswald was there. The station reported his
description to Headquarters, and asked for a photograph of Oswald
to compare with the photograph of this man. After the assassination,
the Station sent the photograph to Dallas and simultaneously
realized from television pictures, the individual was not Oswald
CIA to this day maintains it does not know who this unidentified
individual is. ,

In any event, after the assassination CIA concentrated most of
its efforts on Soviet Embassy personnel in Mexico City who may have
contacted Oswald and on other alleged contacts of Oswald there.

The great mass of material the CIA holds on the assassination
has precluded exhaustive analysis of the thoroughness of its
investigation in Mexico City. The Select Committee staff, operating on
the assumption that information received by CIA immediately after the
assassination,» probably the most reliable, analyzed this information

.closely. The staff attempted to determine what, if anything, was done

to pursue the leads contained in this information.

It must be remembered that both CIA Headquarters and the station
in Mexico City were operating under tremendous pressures after the

assassination and were receiving a great deal of irrelevant informa-

tigating the assassination, but only to note the unresolved leads.
‘Furthermore, ‘the Warren Commission staff travelled to Mexico
City and was given access to files there and at Headquarters. The Committe.
staff did not attempt the difficult and tedious job of determining
precisely what documents the | Commission staff actually read or what
documents it had access to. . There are summaries of the documents
the Warren Commission staf€ reveiwed in Mexico City and from these
summaries it seems the staff did not review many of the Station's
files; but these summaries are not necessarily accurate or complete.
In any event, the Select Committee's review of CIA files on
Mexico City yields a different picture of Oswald's visit there than
that painted in the publie version of the Warren Report. Moreover,
these documents disclose unusual activity by both the Soviets and

Cubans in Mexico City, which may or may not relate to the assassina~

tion, but.are, in the least, coincidental with it.

Oswald went to the Soviet Embassy on September 27, sometime
after arriving in the city.

He visited the Cuban Consulate in the afternoon asking for a
visa and indicating he had previously been to the Soviet consulate.
He dealt with a Mexican employee of the Cuban Consulate named Sylvia
Duran. She attempted to determine whether the Soviets had granted
a visa and learned they had not. She told Oswald he could not get
a visa to Cuba for travel on to Russia unless he had the Russian visa

first. This is substantiated by the documents furnished by the Cuban

ments not seen by the Warren Commission staff.

government.
a
The next morning Oswald apparently visited the Soviet Consulate
again and then went to the Cuban Consulate. He had to return to the
Soviet. Consulate later in the day to give the Soviets his "address"
which the Cubans had.
' There is no explanation for why Oswald had to get his address
from the Cubans, nor is it known whet fr it'was his address in the “
United States or in Mexico City. However, in 1967 Sylvia Duran
reportedly said that she had sexual
relations with Oswald. She denied this in 1963 when interrogated
by Mexican authorities.
Either on this day or the previous day, Oswald allegedly got
into an argument with the Cuban consul, Asque. This fact was initially
brought out in the interrogation of Duran by Mexican authorities
immediately after the assassination. It was substantiated by Oswald's
letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington of November 9, 1963,
in which he complainecabout the attitude of Asgue. However, in mid-
1964, it was reported that Oswald had also told Asque that he
intended to shoot Kennedy. A 1967 article in the National Inguirer
- and the Mexican newspaper, Novedades, reports an interview by a
British journalist, Comer Clark, with Castro in which Castro said
Oswald told Asque that he planned to shoot Kennedy. .
Oswald may have met with the Soviet Consul and KGB agent, Yatskov,

while in Mexico City. Oswald may also have met Vice-Consul and KGB

agent Kostikov; Oswald's letter to the Soviet Embassy refers to a

* The Warren Commission Report tends to suggest Oswald did not
contemplate assassination until a mid-November slight by Marina.

HW 50955 Dockd:32423526 Page 71


7°

discussion with "Comrade'Kostin." Oswald easily could have been
confused or could have forgotten Yatskov's name, so there seems to
be no significance in the fact he met Yatskov. Kostikov is believed
to have been in the KGB's 13th Department, specializing in sabotage
and assassination. However, Kostikov, as part of his “cover was
responsible for issuing visas and CIA developed no evidence that
Oswald's contact with Kostikov was other than for the purpose of
obtaining a visa.

Nothing is known about Oswald's activities on September 29°
or 30 -- although his visa application furnished by the. Cubans in-
dicates he wanted to travel to Cuba on September 30. The Cuban
documents show his application was-not approved until October 27 and
then only on the condition that he have a Soviet visa.

On October 1, Oswald again contacted the Soviet Consulate
about approval of his visa application. He was told there was no
further information but a telegram had been sent to Washington. .

CIA developed no further information in Mexico City about Oswald
until the assassination, But shortly after the shooting in Dallas
the CIA learned at least one Cuban and one Communist Bloc official
in Mexico City wepertedty said something to the effect that they knew
“almost before “Kennedy."" This possibly means word of Oswald's
threat against Kennedy, expressed to Asque, had spread throughout
the Communist Bloc establishment in Mexico City before the assassina-
tion.

After the assassination CIA received a report from a source,

later determined to be prone to exaggeration, that a reporter in

an

Mexico ‘said the Cubans had met Oswald at a restaurant on ‘the out-
skirts of the city during his visit. The Mexican reporter denied
the story to FBI investigators. Employees of the restaurant were
interviewed and, after being shown pictures of Oswald and various
Cuban officials, stated they could not recall seeing them at the
restaurant.
The day after the assassination Mexican authorities arrested
Sylvia Duran, the person Oswald contacted at the Cuban Consulate
Her arrest was strongly protested by the Cubans. Even if Cuba had
no involvement with Oswald, the Cubans would be concerned about
U.S. suspicions. In any event, the Cuban Ambassador met with
Duran and reviewed what she had told the Mexicans. He then summarized
what she told him in a report he sent to cuba. Despite this report
the Cubans remained concerned about allepations Duran might tell somethinc
about "money" ‘and Oswald. Only after the Cubans were sure chat she
hadn't, did they decide it was safe to act on the information they
had.
Shortly after the assassination, CIA learned of unusual activi-
ty on flights to Cuba. First, it was reported that a Cubana airline
‘ flight from Mexico City to Cuba in late afternoon on November 22 was
delayed some five hours in order to take on an unidentified passenger
who arrived in a small aircraft and who boarded the Cubana flight without
passing through customs. No further information was ever received by
CIA and there is no evidence that any further investigation was ever
made.
Second, an American of Cuban birth (referred to herein as the
Cuban-American) was reported to have travelled from Tampa to Texas

where he crossed into Mexico on November 23. On November 25, he arrived

HW 50955 Dockd:32423526 Page 73


in Mexico City and departed on a late evening flight to Havana
on November 27. He was the only passenger on the Cubana airlines
flight which had a crew of nine.

Information available to CIA also indicated that Soviet couriers
were engaged in “unusual! travel between New York, Mexico City, and
Havana both before and immediately after the assassination.

CIA drew no conclusion about this unusual activity.

3. Major Deficiencies in CIA's Investigation

a. Nossenko. :

In repeated testimony before the Select Committee, Mr. James
Angleton, who was head of CIA counterintelligence for 20 years,
emphasized the strange case of the defector Nossenko as a basis for
his concern about Warren Commission findings. Nossenko, a high level
KGB officer, defected to the U.S. in early 1964. Among other things,
he told a story of KGB's belief that Oswald was unstable and of KGB's
resultant disinterest in Oswald during his stay in Russia. Nessenko
claimed to have reviewed the complete KGB dossier on Oswald shortly
before his defection and assured interrogators that KGB had no connec-
tion with Oswald.

Mr. Angleton testified that neither he nor other CIA personnel
responsible for Nossenko's interrogation believed him to be telling
the truth -- in Mr. Angleton's parlance, Nossenko lacked bona fides.
Current CIA counterintelligence officials, who strongly disagree
with Mr. Angleton's policies generally, now assert that Nossenko

is bona fides.

HW 50955 DocId:32423526 Paye 74

ye


%

Rive:
Thus there is a difference in opinion between the "count tha tigence
experts as to the reliability of Nossenko's story.

If Nossenko is not bona fides but is instead a plant, then there
is a very troubling question as to why he defected and as to why
nis story exonerates the-KGB from a role in the assassination. Per-
haps his defection was designed to give CIA incorrect
information on many aspects of the .
KGB's operation -- in which case his story about Oswald could still
be true. .However, there seem to be inconsistencies between his
knowledge of the Oswald case and the known information about Oswald.
For example, he claimed to have reviewed the entire KGB file on
Oswald, yet he had no knowledge of Oswald's visit to Mexico City
other than the bare fact that he went there. He did not tell
interrogators, what surely must have been in Oswald's file, that
Oswald met Yatskov and Kostikov -- both KGB agents. In any event,
the Nossenko defection remains as mysterious now as it was in 1964.

b. Pursuit of the Cuban Connection

With ‘substantial evidence pointing to Cuban involvement, in the
assassination, CIA would logically have been expected to use its
resources to conduct a vigorous investigation of that connection.

did not happen.

The Mexico City Station informed Headquarters immediately after
the assassination that the Mexican government, like CIA, knew that

Oswald had met with Sylvia Duran at the Cuban Consulate. It

. - oa :

further cabled that the Mexican authorities planned to arrest and inter-
rogate Duran. Upon learning this Mr. Karamessines, then assistant to
DDP Helms, ordered Mr. Whitten of the Mexican desk of the Western
Hemisphere Division to telephone the Chief of Station on an open
line to call off the arrest. The telephoned order was too late
for Duran had already been arrested. However, Whitten did not agree
with the order and wrote a memorandum for record stating that he
carried out the order despite his personal objection to it

Later that day, a message from Headquarters cautioned Mexico
City Station about the interrogation of Duran because "it could
jeopardize U.S. freedom on the whole question of Cuban responsibility."
Neither Mr. Karamessines nor Mr. Whitten have been questioned about
this order, but Mr. Angleton testified he was-umaware-of—it-and cannot
understand why it was issued.

More importantly, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Thomas Mann,
apparently was at this time extremely interested in investigating
the role of the Cubans. CIA cables from Mexico reveal-he was
exerting pressure on CIA, FBI and State Department personnel to
investigate the Cuban connection. He proposed that Mexican authorities
arrest Maria Louisa Caleron, a Cuban consulate employee, and the
Cuban Consul Mirabil. The Chief of Station cabled headquarters about
this pressure and warned of the "flap potential" of the Ambassador's
continuing along his line of investigation. The Chief of Station is
now dead so he cannot explain the meaning of his cable. The FBI
representative in Mexico City who sat in on meetings with the Am-

bassador and Chief .of Station testified that he was not aware of

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 76


any CIA reluctance to pursue Cubdn involvement; ‘and, ‘he’ expressed
surprise that the Chief of Station sent such a message to Head-
quarters. Moreover, Director McCone's calendar reveals he met with

Ambassador Mann and Mr. King on December 13, 1963 in Washington.

“The Select Committee has not yet been able to obtain records of this

WW 50955

meeting.

Indeed very little is known about the actions of the Cuban
diplomatic/intelligence personnel in Mexico City either before or
after the assassination.

Unlike the Soviet KGB personnel, Cuban intelligence officers were
not closely watched by CIA. Maria Louisa Calderon, who was alleged
to have been in contact with Oswald, moved her residence on the
afternoon of the assassination and moved into the Cuban Embassy after
the arrest of Duran. She returned to Cuba on December 13

Furthermore, CIA undertook a major review of its Cuban policy
immediately after the assassination. In early December, Head-
quarters first approved and then called off several operations
against Cuba. CIA's Florida station ("WAVE") complained about
the confusing orders, but Headquarters assured WAVE that everything
depended upon the high level review of Cuban/Caribbean policy.

Indeed White House documents of January 1964, note that orders
had been issued in early December 1963 delineating the types of
operations that could be conducted pending final decision by the
President as to future Cuban policy. CIA has not yet given the staff
access to its files on this review process

Throughout January, February, and March, review at the White
House level continued. Notes of discussions at these meetings are

quite detailed, but the AMLASH operation was never mentioned by

Docld:32423526 Page 77


name, nor so far as we can determine, by even a general description.
There, is no reference in these notes to the events of the Fall of
1963, although almost every other CIA operation is detailed.

In November 1964, AMLASH was again in. contact with CIA through
an intermediary and the White House staff was duly informed of this.
However, the staff was only told that AMLASH had been working for
CIA since 1961 and had provided valuable information. ‘The staff
was not told that CIA had met AMLASH in’ connection with a coup or
assassination attempt.

Memoranda for Record prepared by Director McCone of his
meetings with President Johnson from November 22, 1963 through
January 31, 1964, were reviewed by the staff of the Select Committee.
There is no mention in. those memoranda of the AMLASH operation or
the possibility that CIA plots. against Castro prompted him to re-
taliate. ,

In. 1967, Mr. Helms orally briefed President. Johnson on the CIA
1.G. report on assassination.. Helms‘ handwritten notes prepared for
the briefing do not refer to any activity after mid-1963 although
the I.G.'s report detailed the AMLASH operation as an assassination

- plot. As previously mentioned, Mr. Helms has testified he did

not regard the AMLASH operation generally as an assassination plot.

ce. -Special Affairs Staff Information on Cuban Groups

4s mentioned previously, CIA was engaged in a variety of covert
operations against Cuba. At Headquarters, the Special Affairs Staff
was. responsible for Cuba. The WAVE station in Florida actually car-
ried out the operations. WAVE had at least two major ties to the
Cuban exile community. First, it employed exiles in CIA-controlled
operations against Cuba. Cuban exiles were used as members of agent
teams landed in Cuba and as the crews of boats and aircraft supporting
operations. . Necessarily, WAVE personnel were actively recruiting
Cuban exiles for these operations and probably had a great deal of
information about Cuban exile groups.

Second, WAVE apparently had responsibility for liaison contact
with the two “autonomous groups." Both of these groups had extensive
contacts in the Cuban exile community.

Despite WAVE's potential for assisting in the investigation of'
the assassination -- especially regarding Oswald's connection with
Cuban exiles and allegations he was seen in the company of Mexicans
or Cubans -- WAVE was not directed to give such assistance

Although the Warren Commission requested FBI to furnish what in-

formation it held on various Cuban groups, it made no similar request

of CIA. The Select Committee has not been able to learn why the
Commisssion did not make such a request’ -- particularly significant

in view of the fact that FBI's response noted CIA might have an
operational interest in Cuban groups. In any event, a large and possibly
fruitful area of investigation, the CIA's ties to Cuban groups, was

not investigated by the Warren Commission or the, CIA.

d. The Cuban-American

As mentioned previously, CIA learned that the Cuban-American
erossed the border from Texas into Mexico on November 23. CIA knew
that the border had been closed by Mexican authorities immediately
after the assassination and reopened on November 23, so such a
crossing was itself cause for investigation. The Cuban-American -
arrived in Mexico City on November 25, He stayed in a hotel until the
evening of November 27, when he departed on a late evening Cubana
airlines flight to Havana, using a Cuban "courtesy visa‘! and an
expired U.S. passport. He was the only passenger on that flight, which
had a crew of nine.

In March 1964, CIA received a report that a source alleged the
Cuban-American had received his-permit to enter Mexico on November 20
in Tampa, Florida. The same source also said the Cuban-American was
somehow "involved in the assassination." There is no indication
that CIA followed-up on this report.

The FBI did investigate this individual after receiving CIA's
report of his unusual travel. The FBI's investigation terminated
after publication of the Warren Report, because the Cuban-American
was then in Cuba and so outside the FBI's jursidiction.

The FBI’s reports on the Cuban-American are confusing and
zucuuplLete but they are the only available information about him.  sne
following information is taken from those reports.

The Cuban-American applied for a U.S. passport at the U.S. Consul
Office in Havana on June 2, 1960. He presented proof that his mother

was an American citizen although she moved to Cuba with her parents

HW 50955 DoclId:32423526 Page 80


when she was eight months old. She married the:¢
father, a Cuban national in 1939 and the Cuban-American was born
-in 1940. His mother, in documents submitted with his application

for passport indicated she planned to remain in Cuba. On July 13
1960, the Cuban-American was issued a passport, but it was only valid
until January 25, 1963, the date he would become 23 years old

The Cuban-American requested Cuban authorities to permit him to
return to Cuba on May 15, 1962. The Cuban-American's cousin said the
Cuban-American had spent several weeks in Cuba and apparently he did
travel there sometime after May 15, 1962.

In August’ 1962, the Cuban-American married an American woman,

11 years his elder. They lived in Key West until June 1963, when
they moved ‘to Tampa.

In August 1963, his wife moved back to Key West because of marital
problems. His wife and others characterized the Cuban-American as
pro-Castro.

The Cuban~American allegedly told FBI's sources that he had origin-
ally left Cuba to evadegititicary service, but Selective Service
records disclosed that he registered for cheMratt on July 29, 1969,
at Key West -- shortly after his arrival in the U.S. He was
classified 4-F on February 23, 1962, because of a language barrier

“and because he had a physician's letter stating he had grand mal
epilepsy. Nevertheless, some sources told FBI that the Cuban-
American had returned to Cuba in 1963 because he feared being drafted.
Others attributed his return to his worry about his parents or about

his own health.

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 81


It was also reported to FBI that the Cuban-American had a brother
in the Cuban-military who was studying in the Soviet Union.

On November 17, 1963, according to several sources, the Cuban-
American was at a get-together at the home of a member of the Tampa
Chapter of the Fair Play -for Cuba Committee, where color slides
of Cuba were shown.

[T]here was some talk about [the Cuban-American} having
been at the residence for some time waiting for.a tele-
phone call from Cuba which was very important. It was
understood that it all depended on his getting the ‘'go
ahead order" for him to leave the United States. He

indicated he had been refused travel back to his native
Cuba . x}

On November 20, 1963, the Cuban-American obtained a Mexican tourist
card at the Honorary Consulate of Mexico in Tampa. He crossed the
border into Mexico at Nuevo Laredo on November 23. Apparently
because the Cuban-American was not listed as the driver of any
vehicle crossing the border that day, FBI concluded he crossed in
a privately owned automobile owned by another person.

On December 10, 1963, at the regular monthly meeting of the Tampa
-FPCC, a woman told the group that she had telephoned Cuba at 5:00 a.m.
and learned the Cuban-American had arrived there safely via Texas and
Mexico. On January 16, 1964, the same woman reportedly said he had
borrowed $190 prior to his leaving for Mexice.

On September 3, 1964, a source who told FBI that he was acquainted
with the Cuban-American said he borrowed $150 for his travel but
repaid only $25. Another source reported that as of September 1964, the

Cuban-American was not working in Cuba but spent a great deal of time

playing dominoes.

President Kennedy made several public appearances in Tampa on

The preceding was the extent of the FBI's and on investi-
gation. So far as’ we can determine, neither FBI nor CIA told the
Warren Commission about the Cuban-American's strange travel. Warren
Commission files contain an excerpt of the FBI's check on
the Cuban-American at the Passport Office, but nothing else. In
responding to the Commission's request for information on the Miami
chapter of FPCC,.FBI mentioned the Tampa chapter had 16 members in
1961 and was active in May 1963. The FBI response did not mention
the Cuban-American or the November and December 1963 meetings.
Moreover, a possible connection between Oswald and the Tampa
chapter of FPCC was already indicated. Oswald applied to V. T. Lee,
national president of the FPCC, for a charter for a New Orleans
chapter. Lee wrote Oswald on May 29, 1963, suggesting Oswald get
in touch with the Tampa chapter, which V, T. Lee had personally
organized. Thus, the suspicious travel of this individual coupled
with the possibility that Oswald had contacted the Tampa chapter
certainly should have prompted a far more thorough and timely
investigation than FBI conducted and the results should have been
volunteered to the Warren Commission, regardless of its failure to

request the information.

THE FBI'S ASSASSINATION INVESTIGATION

Preliminary Discussion
The FBI's investigation of the assassination was a massive
effort. Literally thousands of leads were followed by hundreds
of agents, many of whom during the days, immediately following
the assassination worked round the clock. The investigative
files total over five hundred and ninety volumes of materials.
Although theSoumittee reviewed FBI materials in areas
where allegations of disclosure or ‘investigative difficiencies
had been advanced, existing limitations of personnel and time
precluded Committee review of the Bureau's entire investigative
effort. Rather, than randomly selecting for examination a
limited number of other substantive investigative areas, the
WFomni tree directed the staff to review documents and examine
Bureau employees to determine whether there were any limitations
placed on the assassination investigation, or whether the
Bureau withheld evidence from the Warren Commission. the
Gomméttee began this aspect of Bis investigation with the
impression -- subsequently confirmed -- that the Warren
Commission had not been informed of the CIA's attempts on
Fidel Castro's life. Whether knowledge of these attempts,
or existing Bureau activities, or the Bureau's relationship
with the Commission, is likely to have affected the process
"by which information flowed from the Bureau to the Commission

or.the Bureau's assassination investigation, is discussed in

in next three sub-sections of this chapter. The remaining
sub~sections consider certain aspect of the Bureau's investigative

efforts in Dallas, Mexico City, and New Orleans.

(a) The internally admitted investigative deficiencies in
“the Bureau's’ handling of the pre-assassination Oswald
case : :

Immediately after the assassination, J. Edgar Hoover
instructed that a complete analysis be made of “any investi-
gative deficienciés in the Oswald case." By memorandum dated
December 10, 1963, Assistant Director J. H. Gale (Inspection
Division) reported that there were a number of investigative
and reporting delinquencies in the handling of the Oswald case

as follows:

Oswald should have been on the Security
Index; his wife should have been interviewed
before the assassination, and investigation
intensified --. not held in abeyance -- after
Oswald contacted Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

In the paragraph immediately preceding the section of the
report which sets forth Mr. Gale's recommendations for disci-
plinary actions, he observes:

Concerning the administrative action recom-
mended hereinafter, there is the possibility
that the Presidential Commission investigating
instant matter will subpoena the investigating
Agents. If this eccurs, the possibility then
exists that the Agents may be questioned con-
cerning whether administrative action had been
taken against them. However, it is felt these
possibilities are sufficiently remote that the
recommended action should go forward at this
time. It appears unlikely at this time that
the Commission's subpoenas would go down to the
Agent level.

to which Mr. Hoover noted: "In any event such gross incompe-

tency cannot be overlooked nor administrative action postponed."

HW 50955 Dockd:32423526 Page 86


eo

The following addendum to Mr. Gale's report was written

by Assistant Director Cartha D. DeLoach:

L recommend that the suggested disciplinary
action be held in abeyance until the findings
of the Presidential Commission have been made
public. This action is recommended inasmuch as
any “leak” to the general public, or particularly
to the communications media, concerning the FBI
taking disciplinary action against its personnel
with respect to captioned matter would be assumed
as a direct admission that we are responsible for
negligence which might have resulted in the x
assassination of ‘the President. At the present
time there are so many. wild rumors, gossip, and
speculation that even the slightest hint to out-
siders concerning disciplinary action of this
nature would result in considerable adverse re-
action against the FBI. 1 do not believe that
any of our personne? will be subpoenaed. Chief
Justice Warren has indicated he plans to issue
no subpcenas. There is, however, the possibility

.that the public will learn of disciplinary action

being taken against our personnel and, therefore,
start a bad, unjustifiable reaction,

immediately below which Mr. Hoover noted: "I do not concur."

On December 20, 1963, 17 Bureau employees (5 field investigative

agents, 1 field supervisor, 3 special agents in charge, 4 headquarters

supervisors, 2 headquarters section chiefs, 1 inspector, and 1 assis-

tant director) were disciplined (i.e., censured and/or placed on pro-

bation) for “shortcomings in connection with the investigation of Os-

wald prior

of some of

to the assassination." Although the transferring

these agents was discussed at that time, certain

transfers were held in abeyance until the issuance of the Warren

Commission"

I.
One of the investigative shortcomings idéntified by

Assistant Director Gale was the failure to include Oswald's

name on the Security Index.* Indeed, of the’ seventeen agents
supervisors, and senior officials who were disciplined, not a

single one believed that Oswald met the criteria for the Secu~

ob Te
rity Index. In this regard AssistantaDirector Alan Belmont

noted in an addendum to Mr. Gale's, 12/10/63 memorandum that:

It is significant to note that all of. the
supervisors and officials who came into con-
tact .with this case at the seat of government,
as well as agents in the field, are unanimous
in the opinion that Oswald did not meet the
exiteria for the Security Index. If this is.
so, it would appear that the criteria are not
sufficiently specific to include a case such
as Oswald's and, rather than take the posi-
tion that all of these employees were mis~
taken in their judgment, the criteria should
be changed. This has now been recommended
by Assistant Director Gale.

Mr. Hoover made the following handwritten notations next to
Mr. Belmont's addendum: "They were worse than mistaken";
"Certainly no one in full possession of all his faculties can

claim Oswald didn't fall within this criteria."

* The Security Index and the criteria pursuant to which
names are selected for inclusion are discussed in detail on
pages 195-199 of Tab D of the Committee's Domestic Report.

With respect to the Oswald case, however, it is important to
understand that under the procedures then in effect, the inclu-
sion cf Oswald on Security Index would not have resulted in
the dissemination of Oswald's name to the Secret Service.

HW 50955 Dockd:32423526 Page 88


aw
On September: 24, 1964 -- the same day the Warren Commis-
sion's report was officially released ~-- Assistant Director

William C. Sullivan wrote:

In answer to the question as to why Lee
Harvey Oswald was not on the Security Index,
based on the facts concerning Oswald which
were available prior to his assassination ‘of
the President, it was the judgment of the
agents handling the case in Dallas and New
Orleans. The Dallas field supervisor and
the SAC in New Orleans as well as supervisors
at the Seat. of Goverment that such facts did
not warrant the inclusion of Oswald in the
Security Index. The matter has, of course,
been re-examined in the Bureau and Mr. Gale
by memorandum 12/10/63 expressed the opinion
that Oswald should have been placed on the
Security Index prior to 11/22/63. The
Director concurred with Mr. Gale's opinion
and administrative action has been taken.*

Mr. Hoover's handwritten notations on the above-quoted Sullivan
memorandum were with respect to the Bureau personnel who failed
to include Oswald on the Security Index, “They could not have
been more stupid,” and with respect to administrative action,
“And now that the Bureau has been debunked publicly I intend
to take additional administrative action."

Special Agent Hosty testified before the Warren Commission
on May Z, 1964, He had previously requested to talk to
Mr. Hoover, and he learned from Assistant—Direster Alan Belmont
on the morning of May 6, 1964, that he would be allowed to see

the Director later that day. According to SAHosty, the

that~E-hed nothing to worry about. Fr racca, ‘this is exactly
what_S& Hosty recounted to SB@ Gordon Shanklin upon his return
to Dallas.** Mr. Hoover's version of the meeting differs con~
siderably from S&°Hosty's. According to the Director:
[I] discussed with him the situation

which had devéloped in Dallas . . . and

of embarrassment which had been caused. aad
On September 28, 1964 -- some four days after the issuance of
the Commission's report -- eight ef the Bureau employees against
whom disciplinary action had been taken in December of 1963
were again censured and/or put on probation (ana some this time
transferred) for reasons identical to those that led to action
being taken against them in December 1963. In addition to the
above eight, three other employees who had not been disciplined

as a result of the Oswald case in December 1963 were disciplined

as follows:

1) A Special Agent in Dalias was censured
and placed on probation for failing to
properly handle and supervise this matter;
2) An inspector at FBI HQ was censured for
not exercising sufficient imagination and
foresight to initiate action to have Securit
Index material disseminated to Secret Service;
3) An Assistant. to the Director at FRI HQ
was‘censured for his overdll responsibility
in this entire matter.

In a memorandum disseminated to senior bureau officials on
October 12, 1964, Mr. Hoover noted:
There is no question in my. mind but that we
failed. in carrying through some of the most
salient aspects of the Oswald investigation.
Tt. ought to be a lesson to ail, but I doubt
if some even realize it now.
J. Edgar Hoover did not believe that the fact of discipli-
nary action would ever become known outside the Bureau, It did
not until October 1975, Neither the testimony of FBI personnel
nor the materials made available to the Commission suggest
the slightest investigative deficiency in the Buréau's pre-assassina-
tion Oswald case. Indeed, the record gives just the opposite impres-
sion, However, the documentary record made available to the Committee
reveals that Bureau officials were continually concerned with the
possibility that the FBI might be regarded as "responsibie for
negligence that resulted in the assassination of President Kenneedy

because of pre-assassination investigative deficiencies in the

Oswald case."*

(b) ~The Bureau's: perception of the Warren Commissi nd Ohradbersary.

Not only was the Bureau subjected to its first major public
exiticism in years for its handling of the pre assassination case;
A majority of Americans were skeptical of the Bureau's stated in-
vestigative findings that Oswald was the assassin and that he acted
alone. The Warren Commission itself noted in its report that:
“Because of the numerous rumors and theories, the public interest
in insuring the truth Was ascertained could not be met by merely 1
adopting the reports on the. analysis of Federal or state agencies." 4

Assuming, arguendo, that the Warren Commission reported either
“that the Bureau's handling of the pre assassination Oswald case
was deficient in some manner, the FBI would have been open to em-
barrassment and criticism and charged with responsibility for the
assassination. Given this possibility and J. Edgar Hoover's known
hostility and established reactions to either criticism or embarr-
assment (be it personal or of the Bureau), it is not at all sur-
prising that from its inception Mr. Hoover, and therefore the Bureau,
perceived the Commission as an adversary. ;

J. Edgar Hoover had, by November 23, 1963, informed President
Johnson of the Bureau's preliminary investigative findings: viz.,

(2)

that Oswald was the assassin and that he acted alone. Ina

November 9, 1963,° memorandum, Mr, Hoover recounts a telepho:

versation he had that day with President Johnson:

The President called. and asked if I am
familiar with the proposed group they are
trying to get to study my report - two from the
House, two from the Senate, two from. the courts,
anda couple of outsiders. . I replied that I
had not heard of that but had seen reports from
the Senate Investigating Committee.

The President stated he wanted to get by
just with my file and’ my report. I told him
I thought it would be very bad to have a rash
of investigations. He then indicated the. only
way to stop it is to appoint a high level comm-
ittee to evaluate my report and tell the House
and Senate not to go ahead with the investi-
gation. I stated that would be a three-ring
circus,

ve

I advised the President that we hope to
have the investigation wrapped up today but
probably won't have it before the first of the
week as an. angle in Mexico is giving trouble -
the matter of Oswald's getting $6,500 from the
Cuban Embassy and coming back to this country
with it; that we are not able to prove that
fact; that we have information he was there on
September 18 and we are able to prove he was
in New Orleans on that date; that a story came
in changing the date to September 28 and he
was in Mexico on the 28th. I related that the
police have again arrested Duran, a member of
the Cuban. Embassy; that they will hold her two
or three days; will confront her with the orig-
inal informant and will also try a lie detector
test on her.

The President then indicated our conclusions
are: he is the one who did it;. . . whether he
was connected with the Cuban operation with

HW 50955 Dockd:32423526 Page 93

” money we are trying te nail down. I told
him that is what we are trying to nail
down; that we have copies of the corres-
pondence; that’ none of the letters dealt
with any indication of violence or assassi-
nation; that they were dealing with a visa
to go back to Russia.

On November 29, 1963, President Johnson issued the executive
order establishing the Presidential commission. Bureau documents
veflect that each time Hoover received word that a particular person
was being considered for the Commission or its staff, he asked to
be informed as to “what the Bureau had" on the individual. Although
derogatory information pertaining to members and staff was brought
to Mr. Hoover's attention, the Bureau has informed the Committee
staff that there is no documentary evidence which indicates that

(3) gyitdye ME aera,

. . : . - Tae NT ant
such information was ever disseminateda Wor rn vee

On December 10, 1963, Hoover informed Assistent—Director Alan

Belmont that he would be "personally responsible for reviewing every
piece of paper that went to the Warren Commission.'' Hoover also
designated Inspector James Malley -- who had previously cosupervised
the field investigation in Dallas along with SAG Shanklin -- as the
Bureau liaison with the Warren Commission. In a memorandum re-

counting the December 10 meeting during which Malley was briefed

(3) The Committee and the Bureau defined their terms, such that
“dissemination” includes informing the person himself of the derog-
atory information. Additionally, in order to ensure the protection
of individual privacy, the Committee. directed the staff not to
request access to any derogatory information.

as to his new assignment, the Director wrote,

I told Mr. Malley that I wanted him to
establish the closest and most amiable
working relationship with Mr. Rankin. I told
him that I had personally: known Mr. Rankin
quite well since he had served as Solicitor
General under Attorneys General Brownell and
Rogers.

I also alerted Mr. Malley that there were
indications that the Chief Justice, who headed
the Presidential Commission, was endeavoring
to find fault with the FBI and certain inform-~
ation had been leaked by the Chief Justice to
Drew Pearson which was critical of the FBI's
functioning in Dallas prior to the assassina-
tion.

I told Mr. Malley and Mr. Belmont that the
Chief Justice has now demanded all of the so-
ealled "raw' reports upon which the FBI report
of the assassination was predicated, and in
doing so the Chief Justice had characterized
the FBI report as being in “skeleton form."

I stated the Chief Justice had further added

in his statement. to the press: "In order to
evaluate it we have to see the materials on which
the report was prepared."' I stated that this
statement by the Chief Justice I felt was en-
tirely unwarranted and could certainly have been
phrased better so as not to leave the impression;
at least by inuendo, that the FBI had net done

a thorough job.*

On January 28, 1964, Lee Rankin met with Hoover at the Commiss-
ion's direction to discuss the allegation that Oswald was.an FEL
informant. According to a Hoover memorandum of January 31, 1964:

Rankin stated that the Commission was
concerned as to how this matter. could be re-
solved, and it was for this reason that they
asked him to see me. He stated that the
Commission did not desire to initiate an in-
vestigation on the outside. . . as it might
appear the-Commission was investigating the FBI.

LI commented to him that I had’not appreciated

what I interpreted as carping criticism by the

Chief Justice when he referred to the Bureau's

report originally furnished to the Commission as

Throughout the Warren Commission's existence, Mr. Hoover was

‘kept informed.on a daily basis by Alan Belmont as to (1) the internal
Commission meetings and decisions; (2) the areas in which the Commiss-~
ion was requesting information or further FBI investigation, and (3)
: : (4)
the materials which the Bureau intended to provide to the Commission.
On various occasions, Mr. Hoover learned that the Commission members
and/or staff members had stated that they were impressed with the
testimony of Bureau personnel and the investigation conducted by the
Bureau. His handwritten notation on an April 4, 1964, memorandum
succinctly states his usual response to such complimentary remarks:

I place no credence in any complimentary

remarks made by Warren nor the Commission.

They were looking for FBI "gaps" and having

found none yet they try to get sympathy.

While complimenting the Bureau for ‘its
cooperation, the President's Commission, by
letter dated 3-26-64, forwarded what purports
to be 30 questions (by actual count there are
52 as some of the enumerated questions have
more than one part) to which they request a
reasoned response in reasonable detail and
with such substantiating materials as seem
appropriate. :

The questions are those of a cross-examin=
- ing attorney and it is evident that this is a
cross-examination of the FBI or a part of it
in the case of the assassination of President
Kennedy.
Mr. Hoover noted on the memorandum, "Their so-called compliments of
the Bureau's work are empty and have no sincerity."

Similarly, upon being informed that the Commission intended. to
send two of its staff members to Mexico City, the Director “expressed
concern as to how lawyers on the Commission could spot gaps in our

6
investigation."

As is more fully discussed in subsection (c), supra, Special
Agent Hosty met with Hoover the day after Hosty's Warren Commission
testimony. On that occasion,’ Mr. Hoover mentioned that "the Warren
Commission would exonerate the FBI completely” and that indications
were that "the Commission would vote five to two in the Bureau's

(7)

+The Commission did not "exonerate the FBI completely” and,

in fact, criticized certain aspects of the FBI's handling of the
Oswald pre assassination case and the Bureau‘s failure to inform
the Secret’ Service of Oswald's presence in Dallas, Texas. For
example, the Commission concluded that the "FBI took an unduly
restrictive view of its responsibilities in preventive intelligence

‘work, prior to the assassination.

Cc) ..The Bureau's Reaction to the Warren ission Report

Upon receipt on September 25, 1964, of a copy ofthe Warren
Commission's Report, the Director noted: "I want this carefully
reviewed as it pertains to FBI shortcomings by Gale. chapter 8
tears us to pieces." On September 29, 1964, Mr. Hoover, after
reading a Washington Post article captioned "Praise is Voiced for
Staff Engaged on Warren Report," directed that the Bureau's files on
the 84 staff members listed in the article "be checked." By memo-
randum dated October 2, 1964, the Director was informed that
“Bureau files contain derogatory information concerning the following
individuals and their relatives."

On September 30, 1964, Assistant Director Gale pre-
sented ne EES NTE ROS etor Clyde Tolson with a memorandum that

reviewed the Commission Report "as it pertained to FBI shortcomings."

(1) On November 8, 1966, memoranda were furnished to Marvin Watson,
Special Assistant to President Johnson, at his request, setting forth
background information -- including derogatory materials -- on seven
private citizens who wrote unfavorable articles concerning the Warren
Commission findings. A February 3, 1975, FBI memorandum which dis-
cusses these memoranda and their dissemination in 1966 to the White
House recounts:

No information was developed or furnished to
the White House concerning immoral conduct on
the part of the seven above listed critics of
the Warren Commission with the exception of the
information furnished regarding
[identity of individual deleted for reasons of
privacy. ]

The memorandum is- captioned "Shortcomings in handling of Lee Harvey
Oswald matter by FBI personnel." Gale wrote:

The Commission has now set forth in a very
damning manner some of the same glaring weak-
nesses for which we previously disciplined our
personnel such as lack of vigorous investigation
after we had established that Oswald visited

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

Gale notes instances where the testimony of FBI agents makes the
Bureau look ridiculous and taints its public image." These instances
include, inter alia, the following:

One’ agent testified that conditions in the
Dallas police station at the time of .detention
and interrogation of Oswald weré not "too much
unlike Grand Central Station at rush hour, may-
be like Yankee Stadium during the World Series
games." It is questionable whether the agent
should have described conditions in such an ed-
itorializing and flamboyant manner but rather
should have indicated conditions were crowded.

More importantly, Gale's memorandum reveals a dichotomy between the
Bureau's "public position" and what Bureau officials regarded as the
truth:

The Commission report indicates that we did not
have a stop on Oswald's passport with the De-
partment of State and did not know Oswald applied
for a passport in June 1963, to travel to Western
European countries, Soviet Union, Finland and
Poland. This is another specific example of how
this case was improperly investigated. The same
personnel are responsible for this example as
were previously criticized for not using appro-
priate techniques and making a more vigorous and
thorough investigation, to determine with whom
Oswald in contact or whether he had intelligence

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 100


oa assignment. The Bureau by letter to the
. Commission indicated that the facts did not
warrant placing a stop ‘on the passport as
our investigation disclosed no,evidence that
Oswald was acting under the instructions or
on behalf of any foreign Government or in-
strumentality thereof inspector feels it
was proper at that time to take this “public”
position. However, it is felt that with
Oswaid's background we should have had a stop-
on his passport, particularly since we did
not know definitely whether or not he had any
intelligence assignments at that time.
[emphasis added.

Not surprisingly, Gale states in the “observations” section of this
memorandum:

We previously took administrative action
against those responsible for the investiga-
tive shortcomings in this case some of which
were brought out by the Commission. It is
felt that it is appropriate at this’ time to
consider further, administrative action against
those primarily culpable for the derelictions
in this case which have now had the effect

of pub ly embarrassing the Bureau. [emphasis
added.

After reviewing the aforementioned Gale memorandum, Assistant

Director Alan Belmont forwarded a one page memorandum to Clyde Tolson
on October 1, 1964. Belmont argued that

I think we are making a tactical error by
taking this disciplinary action in this

case at this time. The Warren Commission
report has just been released. It contains
eriticism of the FBI. We are currently taking
aggressive steps to challenge the findings of
the Warren Commission insofar as they pertain
to the FBI.(2) It is most important, there-

(2) These “aggressive steps'' are discussed in an October 6, 1964,
memorandum from Cartha DeLoach to John Mohr, discussed, infra.

fore, that we do not provide a foothold

for our critics or the general public to
serve upon to say in effect, ‘See, the
Commission is right,.Mr. Hoover has taken
strong action against personnel involved

in this case and thus admits that the Bureau
was in error:'

Mr. Hoover disagreed with Belmont's observations, writing:
We were wrong. The administrative action
approved by me will stand. I do not intend
to paliate actions. which have resulted in

forever destroying the Bureau as the top
level investigative organization.G)

Geeta - pthobsd -)

Bureau records reflect that on or about October 1, 1964, a
senior Bureau official instructed Inspector James Malley (who had
handled the Bureau's liaison with the Committee) to telephonically
contact Commission General Counsel J. Lee Rankin and inform him that
“he did the Bureau a great disservice and had out-McCarthyed
McCarthy." A memorandum dated October 2, 1964, reflects that this
request was dutifully carried out.

On October 6, 1964, Assistant Director Cartha D. DeLoach for-
warded to Assistant Director John Mohr a memorandum captioned
"Criticism of the. FBI Followitig the Assassination of the President."

DeLoach wrote: ;

The criticism concerning the FBI and its

role in events surrounding the assassination
of President Kennedy raises three questions

(3) Mr. Tolson also disagreed with Mr. Belmont. In
an addendum to the Gale memorandum Tolson wrote: "Most of
the administrative directions with respect to the Security
Index, the prompt submission of reports, etc., and not the
Oswald case per se."

which merit consideration at this time.
(1) What is the public image of
the FBI at the present time?

Certainly, it cannot be denied that the
public image of the FBI has been affected
in certain areas by the criticism made of
the Bureau and its role in the events taking
place prior. to the assassination of the
President. It is believed this situation
reached one stage during the days immediately
following this event and was climaxed by Dallas
Chief of Police Curry's, statements which left
the, implication this Bureau was seriously dere-
lict in discharging its responsibilities as an
intelligence agency.

The second stage, the most acute,
followed the issuance of the Warren Report

While there is admittedly no absolute way
to assess'a public image, it is believed the
image of the FBI improved steadily since the
week following the assassination, and it im-
proved immeasurably up until the release of
the Warren Report. At the time we suffered
a rough setback. Following the release of the
Director's testimony, we have been well on the
toad back to good prestige. There is every
indication this improvement will continue if
we follow our current program regarding this
situation.

(2) What has-been done to counteract this
criticism of the FBI?

Immediately following the assassination, we
undertook a program designed to eliminate the
misunderstanding as to the statutory respon-
sibilities of the Secret Service and the FBI
which existed among the uninformed. . . -Fvery
appropriate medium such as the news media, radio
scripts, FBI tours, correspondence, speeches and
police training was used to clear the air con-
cerning our responsibility.

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 105



loa.

- . For the more educated group, those who
were not necessarily biased, and who were
aware of the statutory authority of the FBI
we furnished full explanations for our actions
prior to the assassination with respect to Lee
Harvey Oswald. This was designed to convince
them that this Bureau did not fail to properly
evaluate the information available on Oswald
prior to November 22, 1963, and that, in light
of the facts available and the authority granted |
within which to act, we were not derelict in
disseminating pertinent information. to proper
authorities.

woe Ke

(3). What, should be our future course in
this matter?”

The liberal press, with the exception of
the "New York Times," and its friends will
continue to make a determined effort to place
the FBI on the defensive; however, it is not
felt we should engage in any prolonged debate
with them. By keeping the argument going,
we are diverting public attention from Secret
Service and the State Department and their
culpability.

oR OK

The Director has said that "nothing is more
devastating to a smear than an offensive of

real outstanding accomplishments."' Our attention

and energies should be directed toward this end
in the coming months.

At the bottom of the last page of this DeLoach memorandum, Mr.
Hoover made the following handwritten notation:
The FBI will never live down this smear which

could have been so easily avoided if there had
been proper supervision and initiative.

MEXICO CITY

The information developed by the Bureau's investigation in
Mexico is discussed in détail in part two of the preceding sece
tion “The CIA'S Role in the Investigation." The fol-
lowing section discusses certain facts which taken together
give rise to the. issue of the adeqiiacy of the supervision and

Responsibility for the investigation in Mexico City was
corifused. . Both the State Department and the FBT had claim to
supervising it. ,

One of the major areas of investigation soon after Kennedy's
assassination was an allegation of a Nicaraguan named Gilberto
Alvarado Ugarte. Alvarado walked into the American Embassy in
Mexico City on November 25, 1963, and alleged that he had been at
the Cuban’ Consulate on September 18, 1963 and had observed Oswald
teceive $6,500 from a consulate employee. Alvarado eventually
admitted that he had fabricated the allegation: The Warren
Commission reveiwed Alvarado's original claim and concluded it was

gravity of Alvarado's allegation and requested that .the investiga-
rion of Alvarado's claim be given the highest priority. J. Edgar
Hoover shared Mann's concern over the Alvarado allegation noting.

Ambassador Manu may be one of the pseudo-

investigators, a Sherlock Holmes; but he

has made a lot of statements which, if ttue,

throw an entirely different light on the

whole picture. *

In apparent response to Hoover's stated concern; and the
Ambassador's request Assistant Director William C. Sullivan,
Domestic Intelligence Division, instructed Supervisor Lawrence
Keenan to proceed to Mexico City where he was to “direct and
coordinate" the investigation. However, in a memorandum to Alan
Belmont dated November 27, 1963, Sullivan wrote:

Supervisor Lawrence Keenan, in complying
with the Director's request; has been
selected to go to Mexico to direct and
coordinate our entire investigation there
and to pursue it vigorously until the de-
sired results are obtained, **

Mr. Keenan's presence in Mexico City was short lived. He
arrived on November 27, and returned to FRI headquarters on December
lL, 1963. A Sullivan to Belmont memorandiim of 12/3/63 reflects
that once Alvarado admitted he had fabricated his story, the
Ambassador “advised that it was no longer necessary for Kéenan

to stay." Sullivan's previous statement that Keenan was “selected

to go to Mexied to direct and coordinate the entire investigation

ttiere and pursue it vigorously until the desired results are

obtained, wo cannot be reconciled unless the thorough investigation
and desired results were the "breaking" of Alvarado. .

Indeed, CIA documents reflect that Agency's confusion as to
the role Keenan was to play. On November 26, 1963, the Mexico
City station cabled Helms:

Believe FBI in Mexico, as.does station, has

all information needed to investigate Mexican

desirable that FBI send officer to Mexico to

investigative efforts in New Orléans: However, our preliminary
examination has revealed certain factS which give rise to the

igsue of the adequacy of the investieation conducted in that

city, and sugpest the need for more deteiled review.

The Warren Commission's Vepore et:

id moved from

following as reasons for the move:

that Marina had sugsested that he go to
New Orleans since he had been born there.
Marina has testified that the real reason
behind har suggestion vas that she nted
him to get out of foun bacanse of the

There is no indication in FRI documents or the Commission's

record that Oswald was in New Orleans on any eceasion hatween

that there was no record of another’ Oswald arrest, and that the
New Orleans Police Department, in fact, had no information on
Oswald prior to August 9, 1963."

Oswald distributed FPCC handbills in the vicinity of the
U.S.S. Wasp on June 16, 1963, and, subsequently, in downtown New
Orleans, on August 9 (on which o¢easian he vas arrested), and
August 16, On August 17, he appeated briefly on a radio program,

During a staff interview on Pecember 1, 1975, a New Orleans

resident familiar with the Cuban community in thet city, -un-
equivocally asserted that in the summer of 1963 Oswald associated
with various Federal agents in New Orleans. We specifically

identified an inspector who was then with the TSNS Border Patrol

Station in New Orleans and an inspector who was then with the
United States Customs Service. Althcugh this I&NS inspector sub-
sequently testified that he had neithet met nor spoken with Oswald,
he recalled that he "may" have seen Oswald on one occasion passing

out handbilis near Jackson Square in New Orleans, The inspector

also informed the Committee that I&NS in 1963 had some resporsi-

oa
bility for surveilling certain Cuban groups in New Orleans.

Although the inspector could not recall the dates these: eurveillances
were in effect, he believes they had been reauested by the Depart-
ment of Justice. The former Customs inspector had not heard of
Lee ilarvey Oswald (under that name or any of his known aliases)

Although the name {a Tulane University

professor] does not appear in tha Warren Commission Report
materials available at the Archives veflect that the Commission
was provided with certain FBI reports containing information on
the professor developed diiring the asaassination investigation,
A brief review of the Bureau's handling of allegations of an
alleged Oswald acquaintanceship with the professor is instructive.
in that the Committee finds it exemplary of Ene FBI's investiga-
tion of persons with whom Oswald was suspected of having been in
contact. \

On ‘November 27, 1963, the New Orleans FRI field office learned
that sometime in late 1962 some FPCC literature had been found in

the street in the 1200 or 1300 block of Pine Street, New Orleang,

near the residences of two Tulane University prof sors, one of
whom was the professor referenced above.” The teletype frow the
FRL's New Orleans field office, pursuant to which this information
was disseminated to headquarters, noted “investigation being con-
ducted to determine any possible agsoctation with Oswaid.**

On November 30, 1963, New Orleans Police Captain James Arnold
informed SA John Quigley that this professor “had be&én mentioned

ak
as being possibly affiliated with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee."

recalled that Oswald mentioned during the interview that somé of
ees
the meetings of the FPCC had been held on Fine Street. According

to SA Quigley's report on the Arnold interview:

Arnold asked Oswald if [the professor] was a
member of the FPCC. Oswald did not Bive a
verbal answer to this question, but Captain
Arnold said he gathered from the expressions
appearing on Oswald's face and from the words
he uttered at that time, which he could not
recall at this time, thet Oswald knew or was
acquainted with [the professor], He said he
attempted to pursue this further, but Oswald
refused to admit any knowledge of [the pro-
fessor] or ever having been at [the professor's]
home. *

On November 29, SA. Milton Kaack interviewed Lt, Francis Martello
of thé Hew Orleans Police Department, who along with Captain Arnold
was presonk at the August 9 arrest interview of Oswald, According

te Kaack's report, Martello stated:

When questioned, by Martello about, Fair Piay

of the meetings of the FPCC ware held on

evaded the question and appeared to Martello

to have a nervous reaction, Martello ad-

vised during interview he asked Oswald if

he knew [another Tulane University professor].

Oswald refused to answer this question. *

On December 2, 1963, John Rice, Chief of the New Orleans
Seeret Service office, spoke with assistant special agent in
charge, Sylvester, of the New Orleans FRI field office, ** Riée
then related that Charles Steele -- the person photographed with
Oswald passing cut literature in front of the International Trade
Mart Building -- recalled Oswald having told him that soméone at
Tulane University had given him this literature. Rice also tre-
counted a Secret Service interview with Dean Andrews, in which
Andrews recalled Oswald having stated that he vas “patting 625 a
day to do this fi.e., pass out Frc literature]. According to
a subsequent December 6, 1963 vrepert, on Deceriber 3; 1963, the
FBI réquested that the Seorét Service rot intervLew [the professor} .***

having known Oswald." He stated that. "he never tnew of th
existence of a FPCC chapter’ in New Orleans and never had any
connection in any way with any so-called left who organizations ."*
This cursory interviéw apparently satisfied the FBI that

the professor-had not had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.

The documients made available to the Committee fail to reflect

that any of the professor's friends or Pine Street néighbors were
ever interviewed by the FBI, Nor do these doctiments providd any

THE.RECEIPT AND DESTRUCTION OF THE. NOTE WHICH CSWALD PERSONALLY
DELIVERED TO THE FBL'S DALLAS FIELD OFFICE "

iminary Discussion
On or about July 2, 1975, Thomas Johnson, of the. Dallas

Times Herald, advised recently retired Dallas SAC Gordon Shauklin

that an individual, whose identity he would net reveal, had told
him that Oswald had visited the FBI office in Dallas sometime

prior to the assassination; that Oswald left a note -- allegedly
threatening in nature -- for the Agent who had been handling

the Bureau's investigation of Oswald; and that neither Oswald's
visit nor the note was reported prier. to or following the arsassina-
tion of President Kennedy. Shanklin suggested that Johnson should
contact Deputy Associate Director James Adams. ;

On July 7, 1975, Johnson met in Washington, D. C.,. with
Adams and Director Kelley repeating the aforementioned allega-
tiong: The Attorney General was advised of, the allegatiotis on
July B: 1975, and informed that the Bureau intended to conduct
an inquiry regarding them.

Ori July 8, 1975, a conference was held in Director Kelley's
offices. In attendance, in addition to Mr. Adams, were Gordon
Shanklin (former SAC Dallas), i Theodore Gunderson (SAC Dallas),
the headquarters agent presently assigned to the assassina-
tion cage, and Harold Bassett (Assistant Director in Charge of

f. ak
im Lo . el
the Inspection Division). The handling of the investigation

was discussed, and Bassett was assigned personal responsibility
for directing it.

The Bureau's initial file review did not develop any inform-
ation indicating that Oswald had ever visited the Dallas Office
of the FBI or that he had left a note. Interviews of personnel
assigned; in 1963, to the Dallas field office did establish that

(1) Lee Harvey Oswald did, in fact, visit the office

some two or ‘three weeks prior to the assassination:

(2) That Oswald asked to see SA James Hosty; and upon

being informed that he was not in, left a hote for Hosty

(3) That the note was destroyed after the assassination.
However, as to certain of the most basic facts, the evidence
developed by the Bureau contairis sharp conflicts. The FBI's
investigation failed to establish:

() whether the note was threatening in nature;

(2) at whose instruction the ndté was destroyed.

Each of these questions raises important issues. If the note tras
threatening in nature, then the FBI would have been on notice
that Oswald was capable of violence. If the orders to destroy
the note emanated from FBI headquarters, the inference that

there might have been orders to destroy other pie

es of dvidence
is stronger than if the note had been simply destroyed for

entirely personal reasons by egents in tle Dalles field office.

llowever, neither the review of the Bureau's investigative file,
nor the sworn testimony of Bureau personnel alleged to have know-
ledge of the delivery of the note and its subsequent destruction
has allowed the,Gommittee to resolve any of the above noted factual
discrepancies. “The Committee has also not received a satisfac-
tory explanation as to the reasons why the existence of the
nete was not discussed internally in the Bureau, or at the
Dallas field office during the assassination investigation.

Rather than’ attempting to draw conclusions Erom an eviden-

tiaty record replete with factual discrepancies, th “Committee

decided that it would make the entire record available to the
public for its review. Section cB infra,summarizes this record,
highlighting those areas where discrepancies exist. The. materials
relating to the investigation in this area will be made available
under separate cover.

(@) The wording of the note

Approximately one week or ten days prior to November

22, 1963; Osviald appeared at the reception desk in the Callas
Field office and asked to ses Hosty. After being informed that
Hosty was not in, Oswald left an envelope with a note inside.
On the envelope appeared the name SA Hesty. The envelope was

not sealed and the note was partially sticking cub. The recep-



whe : wee

tiohist read the, note and according to her recollection it
vead as follows:

Let this be a warning, I will blow up the

FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you

don’t stop bothering my wife.

Signed -- Lee Harvey Oswald.
Sometinie later in the day the receptionist: personally gave the
note to Hosty. 4/

Hosty recalled the note's wording as:

If you have anything you want to learn, about me.

come talk to me directly. If you don't cease

bothering my wife, I will take appropriate action

and report this to proper authorities. 5/

Hosty's supervisor -- Kenneth Howe --~ who claimed to have
seen the note, said that he seemed to recall it contained sdme
kind of threat but could not remember specifics. 6!

Aside from these three persons -- the receptionist, Agent
Hosty, and Agent Howe -- no one else who was interviewed by the
Bureau admitted having seen thé note, Some indicated they under-
stood that the note contained a threat; however, this was hear-

say knowledge, having come primarily from conversations they had

had with the receptionist.

Hosty had placed the note in his workbox -- where it
remained until the day of the assassination.“ Hosty partic-
ipated in an interview of Oswald at the Dallas Police Department
on the day of the assassination and returned to the Field Office
about an hour later, at which time he was called into ShankLlin's

office; Howe was in the office along with Shankiin; one of them

displayed the threatening note and asked Hosty to explain its

8
- contents. 2!

By Hosty's account, he told them he had interviewed Marina
Oswald and Mrs. Paine on Noveriber 1, 1963; and that when he parti-
cipated in the interview of Oswald at the Dallas Police Depart-

ment, Oswald, upon learning his name, commented that he was the

i Hosty initially stated that he did not recall any signature
on the note and in fact thought it was from the subject of a

case he had handled who had made a complaint alleging his civil
rights had been violated and upon his interview of this individ~

‘ual’s' wife she furnished a different version cf the allegations,

completely wiping out the civil rights complaint. (Hosty affidavit,
7/17/75) “Subsequently, after being informed by Bureau officials
that he had interviewed the above referenced subject in June,

1963, Hosty stated in his affidavit of September 22, 1975,

“lin that] the interview took place in June, 1963, [it seeus]
inconceivable that I would think that this was from [the civil
rights subject]."

one who was talking. to and bothering his\wife -- that if the

Agent wanted to know something about Oswald he should have
comé and talked to Oswald himself. a
At this point, Hosty claims that Shanklin ordered him to
prepare a memorandum setting forth the information regarding
the note and his interview with Marina Oswald and Mrs. Paine.
He stated that he did prepare such a memorandum, three or ‘four
pages in length, and delivered it to Shanklin on the even-
jing of November 22, 1963.42
Agent Howe said that it was he wha found the note in Hosty's
workbox very soon after the assassination of President Kennedy.
- He stated that he took the note to Shanklin's office, bue had
no recollection where the note may have gone or who way have

According to Hosty, approximately two hours a
been pronounced dead on November 24, Howe told him that Shanklin
wanted to see them. Hosty claims that upori arriving in

Shanklin denies having any knowledge of Oswald's visit to

the Dallas Office or of Oswald's leaving a rote there. He main-

_tains- that he did not issue any orders to destroy the note. In

fact, he claims that he had no knowledge of this entire matter
until July 1975.42/
The personnel who were assigned to the Dallas Office in

November 1963, and who have admitted personal knowledge of the

~ Oswald vieit and ucte, ‘all have denied having any knowledge that

the facts of this matter were brought to the attention of FBI
Headquarters.

However, William Sullivan, who was an Assistant Pirectecr at

» the time of the assassination, has stated that he discussed the

Oswald case many times with Shanklin, and that Shanklin men-

‘tioned on one occasion that "he had an internal problew invelv-

ing one of his Agents who had received a threatening message

“from Oswald because the Agent was investigating Oswald." Sulli-

van recalls that Shanklin seemed disinclined to discuss the

matter other than to say he was handling it as a pérsonnel problem

21, 1975, before the Subcommittee en Civil and Constitutional Rights

Som TOP SECRET

Tt is hoped thar the preceding report sufficiently conveys
the preliminary nature of the subcommittee's investigation and
the fact the subcommittee has not been able to develop a complete
evidentiary record in the timé available to it. Where conflicting
evidence was received, the subcommittee has attempted to set forth
both sides in its: report so that the evidence may speak for itself:
Resources did not permit the subcommittee to hear from every witness
whose name arose during the investigation. In certain cases, time
constiaints ‘necessitated that testimoriy be taken prior to the receipt
of all relevant agency materials.

The subcommittee believes that the preliminary nature of its
inquiry precludes the issuance of findings arid conclusions.
However, the subcommittee also believes that disclosure of the
evidence developed to date is necessary. Thus, this discussion
is meant merely to highlight those questions which have arisen during
the course of the investigation: for which the subcommittee has not
received an adequate answer,

Tt is apparent that the Warren Commission's findings were

affected, at least in tone if not in substance, by the FBI
fear the Commission «ould criticize its performance prior te the
assassination. For example, the Bureau by letter to the Commission

indicated that the facts did not warrant placing a shop on Oswald's

HW 50955 DocId:32423526 Page 145


yee

ing under the instructions
or at the behalf of any foreign government. Yet internal FBI
tiemorarida reveal that this was only a "public posture," that
FBI concluded Oswald's background should have caused FBI to request
a stop on his passport, and that disciplinary action was taken
against the agents responsible for this “investigative deficiency."

The Bureau assured the Commission that it had no reason to
believe Oswald was a threat to the Presidént; yet some twd weeks
prior to the assassination Oswald delivered a note; claimed by some
FBI employees to be threatening in tone, te the FBI's Dallas field
cffice; The FBL also knew some Five wéeks before the assassination
that Oswald had been in contact with an alleged KGB sabotage and
assassination case officer in Mexico City; yet it did not know what
Oswald discussed with them, and did not vigorously push its local
agents. to interview Oswald about the meetings. For these failures,
the Bureau also censured certain of its supervisory personnel

The fact that the Bureau had determined that there were
serious investigative failures in connection with its pre-assassina-~
tion Oswald case, was never disclosed to the Warren Commission.
Indeed the documentary record reflects it was the Bureau's "public
position” that this case was "properly handled.”

It is also clear that knowledge of CIA assassination plots
generally, and of CIA's AMLASH operation in particular: would
have focused a great deal of Commission attention on Oswald's

Cuban conhections. Indeed Commission documents reveal its coneérn

with the subject of political assassination generally, in its

and other foreign leaders. ;

Moreover, CIA provided the Commission, and the subcommittee,
with detailed accounts of KGB's Department 13 -- a department
specializing in sabotage and assassination. Knowledgeable CIA
personnel told the subcommittee that they had “second-hand”
information that this Department had hatched plots to assassinate
foreign leaders in.the early 1950s, including a plan to kill)
President-elect Eisenhower during a visit to Korea. However, these
CIA analysts also noted the primary niission of the 13th Department
had changed in the late 1950s to one of preparation for sabotage
in the event of war. They could not subscribe to any theory that
the 13th Department was given a mission of dssassinating President
Kennedy. ;

They -were also asked to analyze Oswald's apparent contact
with the Soviet Vice-Consul Kostikov, an alleged 13th Department
case officer, during Oswald's trip to Mexico City. The analysts
testified that Oswald's contact with Kostikoy and Oswald's: sub-
sequent actions did not conform to the known operating methods of
the 13th Department. Their informed. opinion was the same as that
rveactied by CIA analysts in 1964 -- Oswald was not given a mission
by the KGB to assassinate President Kennedy.

Nevertheless, even the limited amount of evidence the sub-
committee has uncovered in the Guban area raises the issue of
whether the eviderice excluded from the Commission's review would

have affected its findings that Oswald acted alone. Only days

after the CIA met with AMLASH in Brazil and learned of his plan
to enlist U.S. support to topple the Castro regime and to "eliminate"
Castro, Castro met with a U.S. reporter at the Brazilian Embassy
in Havana for three hours, talked of U‘S. leaders supporting
terrorists plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, and threatened
retaliation. He warned the stiuation could lead to a crisis
worsé than the missile crisis of October 1962. Despite this
warning, CIA continued to plot with AMLASH.. Indeed AMLASH asked
for and received the assurance of a senior CIA official that
President Kennedy was fully in support of his intended action

AMLASH was not given thé final assutances he requested -- a8
poison pen device and the promise of a weapons drop (including
vifles with telescopic sights) -- until the very day of the
assassination. However, two days before then, he was telephoned
and told that there would be a meeting on November 22 and that
it was the meeting he requested.

Jean Dahiel, the French reporter, on November 19 to discuss
President Kennedy and his policies may have been e product of his

alarm over Kennedy's strongly anti-Castro speech on November 28 in
Miami. Castro's decision to spend the day with Mr. Daniel on
November 22, especially in view of Daniel's great difficul yin
getting any interview with Castro cannot be explained. Even Daniel,

not privy to the details of CIA plots against Castvo, realized the

Moreover, the CIA uncovered but did not pursue tantalizing
leads which suggested the possibility of Cuban involvement or prior
knowledge in the assassination. It learned that a Cubana Airlines
flight to Cuba on the afternoon of the assassination had been
delayed five hours awaiting an unidentified passenger who arrived
ina light plane, bypassed customs, and rode in the cockpit of
the Cubana aircraft.

It learned that a Cuban-American had left Tampa, where Fresi-
dent Kennedy had made public appearances only four days before the
assassination, travelled to Mexieo on the day after the assassina-
tion, and flew to Cuba as the only passenger on a late evening
flight on November 27, using an expired passport. CIA later re-
ceived an-allegation that this individual was "involved" in the
assassination.

FBI's investigation of this same Cuban-American was also far
from adequate. It was terminated without any conclusion because
the Cuban-American had returned to Cuba. There is no evidence
that the significant FBI reports pertaining to the Cuban-American
which pre-dated the Commission's termination, were provided the
Warren Commission.

The Warren Commission was not given the details of CIA's covert
actions against Cuba. The Commission may not have realized that
CIA's Cuban operations were specially compartmented within CIA
under the Special Affairs Staff and that it bad vot been in contact

with any members of this section.

SAS also directed the activities of the CIA’s WAVE station

some information by WAVE evidencing Oswald contacts with residents
of this Cuban exile community, about Oswald there is no record
of CIA having ever directed WAVE to obtain further information
about Osviald or about various Cubans whose names arose in the course
of the Warren Commission investigation. Indeed, the FRI wrote the

Commission noting that CIA had an operational interest in some

Cuban groups the Commission had inquired about, but the Commission
did not pursue the implicit suggestion that CLA he asked to provide
information on these groups. Although the FBI interviewed some Cuban
exiles connected with CIA operations, neither these individuals

Appendix A

REVIEW OF CLASSIFIED AGENCY AND WARREN COMMISSION MATERIALS

(A) FBT
The FBI has an extensive and efficient data retrieval

system. Each filed document is indexed and serialized. “An abstract
of every document is prepared and filed separately by author and

subject. The system ensures that it is virtually impossible te

destroy the record of a document's exd. stence once that document has_

been filed. However, the Committee is not itself allowed to use
this data retrieval system; it has béen required to make requests
to the FBI and vely upon a good faith compliance. Thus. gaining
access to FBI materials was a tedious and time consuming project.

Unlike the CTA, the Bureau did not make its Oswald and

assassination investigation files available en tosn for review. This

necessitated a series of lengthy Committee document requests.

the Bureau reviewed its files and produced documents responsive to’
the request. In those areas where general document requests would ~
have required an inordinate review of Bureau documents, the Committee

virtually requested access to abstracts of the documents, After

reviewing the abstracts, the Committee selected certain authorizing

documents to be reviewed in their enti

ety, and such documents

were requested by the Committee and produced by the FBI. However,
even the use of abstracts has not allowed the staff to familiarize
itself with FBI materials in other than the few areas to which it
decided to direct Attention. This inability to review even the
velevant FBI documentary record in its entirety should be considered

in evaluating the staff's conclusions and recommendations.

The CIA granted the staff free dccess to three major

(By CLA

files related to the assassination of President Kennedy: the
Agency's "201 file" on Oswald; the files of the Mexico City
Station on Oswald and the assassination investigation; a file of
materials CIA developed because of the Garrison investigation.

Shortly after the assassination Mr: Rocea of the CIA's
Counterintelligence staff was designated the “point of record’ for
then existing CIA's work on the assassination investigation.
Rocca attempted to collect all their existing documents on Oswald and
the assassination and he had those documents, or copies, put into
Cswald’s "201 file." Rocca also attemoted to put into the
the "201 file” all later documents received or generated
by CIA. . Thus the "201 file" on Oswald now has approimately 56 file
folders containing the CIA's pre-assassination documents on Oswald,
documents generated during the Life of the Warren Commission. and .
miscellaneous documents (including books and articles) collected
by the Agency over the past twelvé and one half years relating to
the assassination.

The Mexico City station maintained a smiliar file on
Oswald until 1967 when all its holdings were transferred to CIA
headquartets. The Mexico City Station files fill six large file
Folders.

Since New Orleans District Atterney Garrison made many

Legations telating to,CTA in the course of his investigation

the CLA Office of Security cpened a File on the Garrisen investiga-

tion. That file contains, for the mest part, books and articles

. The sheer size of these files precluded detailed examina-
tion and analysis of each document. The Select Committee staff
concentrated on documents received or prepared in the first few
weeks after the assassination, although it reviewed all documents
prepared during the course of the Warren Commission investigation.

In addition te these files. the Sélect Committed recuested
access to a number of other CIA files, such as those on AMLASH,
those containing Director MeCone's memoranda of conversations with
President Johnson, and those on certain individuals whose namés

Assassination files of the military intelligence agencies --

Navy, Army, and Air Force intelligence -- are considerable. For

the most part, tney are merely duplicate copies of material other
agencies prepared and turned over to the Warren Commission. AlL
three agenices have, with one exception, furnished the staff with

all preassassination documents on Oswald. The Office of Naval
Intelligence (ONI) invoked the third-agency rule and did not give

the staff a copy of any pre-assassination document in its file
which was originated by a third apency but did furnish a lish of

all third-agency documents it acquired between May 1962 and

December 1963. ALL three agencies se the staff access to al

entirety immediately after the assassination by senior State and
Defense Department officials. :

NSA maintains it has no materials pertaining to Oswald, the
assassination, or the cast of characters (American. Soviet, and Cuban)
that were identified by Committee document requests, aside from a
few relatively unimportant documents it furnished. NSA has stated
that it, unlike the other intelligence agencies, has no existing file
on Oswald or the assassination.

The staff interviewed Dr.‘Tordetla, who wae Deputy Director of
NSA in 1963. He stated NSA developed no significant information
relating te the assassination. This statement wae confirmed by Mr.
Angleton of CIA.

(D) SECRET S

The Secret Service -- unlike the CIA and the FBi -- is
not an intelligence agency. It is charged with protecting certain
government officials; (most notably, the President), visiting
dignitaries and Presidential candidates. The Service's protective

research files contain information only on persons who are

presently tegarded as potential threats to the safety of the pro-
tected individuals. Thus, with the exception of the Limited number
of documents pertaining to thet Agency's limited participation in

the assassination investigation, there is little relevant material in

Secret Service files.

The staff reviewed what the Secret Service represented as

HW 50955 Docld:32423526 Page 157 **



1st

all materials pertaining to the esinetion, the subsequent

investigation, and the Warren Commission. Aside from reports dealing
with Presidential protection and the actions of individual agents in
Dallas on November 22, 1963, these materials primarily supplement FBI
reports. They do, additionally, reflect the Service's limited

role in the assassination investigation and reveal. specific instances
where the Service's investigation was terminated at the Bureau's
“request.

Ite is worth briefly noting that the Secret Service did not
have certain documénts one would expect them to have. For example,
there were neither materials pertaining to Warren Commission
proceedings as such, nor memoranda reflecting internal meetings or
discussions relating to Warren Commission testimony by Secret Service
personnel. Additionally, although FBI documents make reference te
Warren Commission related meetings attended by Secret Service
representatives, the Service's files contain no documents which even
refer ta these meetings. .It is also surprising that there is no
formal report of the Service's forty-five minute interview of Marina
Oswald on November 23, 1963 -- the first post assassination interview
of Marina by any Federal agency.
The “absence” of materials is not, in itself, sufficient to

give rise to the inference that documents were not provided to the
Committee. Tt is ef concern, however, and the staff requested a

written cesponse from the Service assuring it that the materials the

staff reviewed are all they ever had

The staff reviewed all documents at 1 & NS on Lee and Marina
Oswaid. Invoking the third agency rule, I & NS refused to allow the
staff to examine FBI documents. However, it did provide a Listing
of these FBI materials.

(F) State Department

The staff reviewed selected materials in State Department
files pertaining to.Lee Harvey Oswald and Marina Oswald. Most of
these documents in State's files were generated elsewhere. The State
Department generated materials relating te: (1) Oswald's applica~
tions for passports; (2) Oswald's defection to and return from the
Soviet Union; and (3) Marina Oswald's admission to the United States

There are significant questions raised by the State
Department's handling of the Oswaldg. For example, with a stop"
on Lee's passport file after his defection, Department procedures
should have precluded the automatic reissuance of the passport Oswald
obtained in July 1963. Other questions surround State's decision

tc allow the Oswalds to return from the Soviet Union (and even finance

the trip) after Oswald's announced defection. However, the Committee
did not pursue these questions; since all this information was available
to the Warren Commission.

An understanding of the information that was made available
to the Commission is a prerequisite te any determination that
evidence was withheld. Although limited resources preeluded a

Appendix B

Were There Connections Between Oswald and U.S. Intelligence

I. Agencies Other Than the FBI

The Warren Commission investigated the charge that Oswald

had in some way been an agent for the U.S. Government and concluded
Thus, close scrutiny of the records of the Federal
agencies involved and the testimony of the responsible
officials of the U.S. Government establish that there
was absolutely no type of informant cr undercover re-
lationship between an agency of the U.S. Government
and Lee Harvey Oswald at any time. (WR 327)

Nevertheless, Warren Commission critics have continuously
asserted such a relationship existed. For example, it has been
claimed that Oswald was an agent for military intelligence and
defected to the Soviet Union at its instigation; or that Oswald
was likewise an agent for CIA. Such allegations often cite the
rather unusual circumstances of his defection to Russia, his
ease in returning to the United States, and the apparent lack
of interest in him by U.S. intelligence prior to the assassination.

Indeed these were unusual circumstances and there is no
satisfactory explanation for them. For example, despite evidence
that the Navy, FBI and State Department were extremely interested
in and did determine the precise date and place Oswald would return

to the United States he was not interviewed by FBI until three

weeks after his return, and even. then was not questioned in detail

HW 50955 DocId:32423526 Page 162


169

as to his activities in the Soviet Union.

‘The subcommittee received testimony from a former CIA émployee~
claiming to have read a CIA report of a debriefing of a re-defector
who had been in Minsk and who was either a corporal or captain
in the Marines. The subcommittee reviewed the cases of other re-
defectors noting many were debriefed by CIA as well as FBI. And,
CIA documents disclose that at least some at CIA had, prior to
Oswald's return, proposed he be debriefed.

Because of CIA's interest in re-defectors and because of the
testimony indicating a possible debriefing of Oswald, some CIA
debriefing of Oswald after his return would be expected. Neverthe-
less, the subcommittee has not been able to locate evidence of a
CIA debriefing. The Oswald file at CIA contains no record of any
contact; the records of the Domestic Contacts Division (the CIA
Division which the former CIA employee alleged to be the originator
of the report he saw) denies having any record of a debriefing. At
the subcommittee's request, CIA reviewed its data base on Minsk
and stated it could locate no information which it could attribute
to Oswald. ;

The limitations and restrictions under which the subcommittee

has operated has not allowed it to definitively resolve the question

One CIA employee did recall reading a report about Oswald's
stay in Minsk. He thought he saw it after the assassination. He
was shown copies of the three known FBI reports summarizing its
interviews of Oswald but could not positively identify any as
the report he saw; however, he indicated one report might have been
the one he saw. Assuming CIA’s denial of such a debriefing is correct
the only explanation for his recollection is that he saw some version
of information on Oswald, such as his diary, which CIA acquired
after the assassination.

HW 50955 Doold:32423526 Page 163


of whether Oswald was in any capacity employed by U.S. intelli-
gence. The extreme compartmentation of information within CIA
makes it possible for CIA to employ agents without centralized
clearance and without records retrievable by anyone other than
knowledgeable CIA employees. Indeed CIA's compartmentation permits
only the Director to have access to all information about all
Agency relationships with agents. However, Director McCone in
1964 denied, under oath, that Oswald was in any way connected with
CIA. He remains the only person qualified to make such a flat
statement.

And there is nothing in any of the CIA's files the subcommittee
staff reviewed which suggests Oswald was employed by CIA. More-
over, present CIA officials state they have found nothing, after
an extensive search to indicate.he was so employed.

Furthermore, from the time of Oswald's defection. to Russia in
1959 until after the assassination, procedures required CIA be
informed of the names of all agents used by any U.S. intelligence
agency. ‘This procedure obviously was necessary in order to avoid
two agencies using the same individual. For example, Army intelli-
gence was required to clear with CIA the name of any agent it
intended to use. ; CIA is not aware of any agency's circumvention of
this procedure. So, if Oswald were employed for foreign intelligence
purposes by an agency other than CIA, there should be a record of
such employment at CIA. CIA has informed the subcommittee that

it has no such record.

Discussion: Alleged Oswald FBI Connections

A. The 1964 Allegation.

On Wednesday, January 22, 1964, J, W. Rankin received a
call from the then Attorney General of Texas, Waggoner Carr.
Mr. Carr stated that he had recieved on a confidential basis
an allegation to the effect that Oswald was an undercover agent
for the FBI since September 1962 and that he had been paid
$200 a month from an account designated as No. 179. Carr
indicated that this allegation was in the hands of the press and
defense counsel for Ruby and suggested ‘that his information
came ultimately from District Attorney Henry Wade, although he
stated that he had not discussed this matter with Wade.

Rankin immediately informed the Chief Justice of these
allegations and a meeting of the Commission was called for

. 5:30, Wednesday, January 22, 1964. Rankin then laid out the
allegations for the attending members. In response to Senator
Cooper's query as to how the Commission could test "this kind
of thing,’ Rankin responded:

It is going to be very difficult for us_to

be able to establish the facts in it. TI am

confident that the FBI would never admit it, and
- I presume their records will never show it.

On Thursday; January 23, 1964, J. Lee Rankin reviewed
a Secret Service Report which summarized an interview of
Houston Post reporter Alonso Hodkine. Hudkins had told
the interviewing Secret Service agents on December 17, 1963
that Allan Sweatt of the Sheriff's Office had an "opinion"
that Oswald was being paid $200 a month by the FBI. Hudkins
also told the Secret Service that Oswald's alleged informant
number was "S172". -

On Friday, January 24, 1964, Rankin and Chief Justice
Warren met at Commission headquarters with Texas Attorney
General Carr, Dallas District Attorney Wade, Assistant Discrict
Attorney Alexander, Leon Jaworski and Dean Storey. They were
informed’ that the sources for the Oswald informant allegations
were several reporters, including Hudkins.

On Friday evening, January 24, 1964, Rankin was informed
that the Secret Service had also interviewed Allen Sweatt regarding
the Oswald informant allegations. Sweatt stated that he received
the allegation from Alexander. He also mentioned Houston Post
reporter Hudkins as a source of the information.

All of the above was presented to the full Commission on
Monday, January 27, 1964. The transcript reflects the concern

of the Commission members with this allegation, and their

desire to avoid offending Hoover and the appearance of accusing

the FBI. Various possible approaches for “running down”
the allegations were discussed. It was decided that Rankin
would inform Hoover directly of these allegations, and allow
the FBI the opportunity to refute the allegations.

Rankin discussed Hudkin's allegation that Oswald was
an FBI informant with James Malley, FBL liaison to the Warren
Commission, on February 7, 1964. . Hudkins was interviewed
by FBI agents on February 8, 1964. He stated that a government

Oswald was on the payroll of either the FBI or CIA with voucher

and no more than $225 a month." Hudkins further stated that

in Dallas and was told that an FBI agent (who was still in the
building) had been trying to locate him. Hudkins met with
two FBI agents, immediately thereafter, and told him that
"$172" had been fabricated. Hudkins testified that he, Hugh
Aynesworth and William Alexander "made-up" the informant story

means of determining whether any of their telephones were
being tapped. According to Hudkins, within thirty minutes of

this conversation an FBI agent from the Houston office (whom

B. MORE RECENT ALLEGATIONS

On January 22, 1964, the allegation that Oswald was an
FBI informant was brought to the attention of the Commission

by Texas officials. John McCone swore that Oswald “was not

an agent, employee, or informant of the CIA . . .* Hoover
swore that "a search (of FBI records). . . discloses that
Oswald was never an informant of the FBI. . ."**Similar

affidavits of Special Agents Shanklin, Clark, Hosty, Carter,
Brown, Howe, Manor, Fain, Quigley, and Lynn were also submitted
to the Commission. ***
More recently, in sworn Committee testimony Special Agents
Hosty and DeBrueys unequivecally denied any Bureau relation-
ship with Oswald. Although the staff is not permitted to physically

teview raw FBI files, in response to specific ponmittee

documents indicating that Oswald was ever a Bureau “source,
informant, agent or asset."
On April 29, 1964 Walter Jenkins, Special Assistant to
President Johnson, informed Assistant FBI Director Cartha
sed
DeLoach that a close personal friend had spoken with an
FBI agent that had assisted in the investigation of the
Oswald case and that the agent had stated that Oswald was
definitely an FBI informant and that Bureau files in Washington
was definitely prove this fact. Jenkins added that the agent
hadalso told his friend that he had been transferred from
New Orleans to Dallas as a result of getting into difficulty
eke
with a woman in the French Quarter. At the close of the
memorandum pursuant to which DeLoach recounted Jenkins

statements for Associate Director John Mohr, DeLoach recommends:

*eJenkins declined to divulge his friend's identity to
the FBI. In that the Committee did not receive the FBI reports
which discuss this matter until March 3, 1976, the staff attempting
to contact Jenkins for the first tiem on March 4, learned
from his attorney that he was under a "doctor's care" and
his health precluded the Committee's directly contacting him.
The attorney agreed to supply the Committee with a doctor's
statement verifying the above, and further agreed that Mr.
Jenkins would answer written interrogatories from the Committee.

‘*ekMemorandum from C. D. DeLoach to J. Mohr, 4/30/64.
According to DeLoach, Jenkins stated that "there was no
question in his mind regarding the falsity “of this allegation,
and Jenkins had previously informed his friend that" this was
an old rumor . . ., and that the FBI had branded it as being
completely false.”

Despite the fact that this matter has been

tied down as being false, it is considered desirable

to review personnel files of agents in Dulles to

find out if any of the Agents have been trans-

ferred there from New Orleans for a type of disciplinary

problem as desribed above. If there is such an

Agent he should be interviewed vegarding this

matter.

The subsequent review of Dallas field office personnel
files revealed that one agent had been transferred from New
Orleans in May, 1958, following misconduct while attending a
night club in the New Orleans French Quarter, and a second

- agent was similarly transferred in May 1960 following an

*

allegation involving himself and a female FBI employee.
:

These agents were personally interview by the Special Agent
in Charge of the Dallas. field office, J. Gordon Shanklin
and the Assistant Special Agent in Charge Kyle Clark.
They categorically denied ever telling anyone outside the
Bureau the reason for their transfer and they similarly

eke
denied telling anyone that Oswald was an FBI informant,

On May 6, 1964 DeLoach orally informed Jenkins of the
Bureau's investigative findings, noting that the Bureau would
not pursue this matter further unless Jenkins subsequenity
chose to reveal his friend's identity.

On January 17, 1976, the Committee staff interviewed

a former FBI agent who had been assigned to the Bureau's Kansas

City field office when Hosty was transferred there from Dalias
in September, 1964. This ex-agent is positive that Hosty told
him that both Hosty and the’ Dallas agent who had handled the
Oswald case prior to Hosty [i.e., John Fain] had attempted to
develop Oswald as a potential security informant ("PSI"). - More
specifically, the agent quoted Hosty as stating:

that Oswald had been a PSI (Potential Security Informant)

for an older agent who reitred just before Hosty moved

to the Dallas office. Hosty told us that his older agent

had had no contact with Oswald, and that one of the last acts

the older agent did before he reitred was to deactivate

the Oswald file as a PSI. Hosty commented that as

part of his effort to reopen the Oswald matter, he left

notes at Oswalds' apartment, urging him to get in touch

with the FBI.- I recall Hosty commenting that although

he had listed Oswald as a PSI, he had not had any
contact with him.*

This former agent also advised that Hosty made similar
remarks to certain other FBI agents then stationed in Kansas
City. The Committee has talked to two agents; neither one

recalis Hosty ever stating that Oswald was a PSI.
