Visit of Cuben Elle Victor Espinosa

Le seer ae

In accordance with our conversation yesterday I have set
forth below a report on the visit of Victor Espinosa.

& Veneruelan Christian Democratic friend of mine, Valmore
Acevedo, called me from New York City yesterday morning to ask
4@8 @ personal favor that I receive a Cuban exile Living there
who had something “amazing” to tell me. When I expressed mild
Skepticism, Acevedo urgently repeated his request and I agreed,
Within a surprisingly short time the Cuban, Victor Espinosa,
arrived at my office (he said he had taken the plane inmedi-
ately). Espinosa gave his address sud telephone mmber as
follows: 415 East 52nd Street, HA 1-7875. A summary of his
statements follows.

Espinosa has been involved in Cuban liberation activities
for many years, He opposed Batista and opposes Castro. He is
mot a member of the March 13 Movement, but has long been very -
close to many of its leaders, including Cubelas, Espinosa wes
trained by CIA, in both Louisiana and Guatemala, and was one
of those who was sent into Cuba prior to the Bay of Pigs, He
plans to become an American citizen. in August of this year,
He admires the United States and American strength and compee

, tence in many fields. He asked a New York acquaintenance of
“a2. Rbs for the name of someone in the Department involved in
Latin American affairs, He was told Acevedo knew such an _
sffictal, Espinosa asked Acevedo (without, he claims, reo”

wealing his story), and the latter called me,

A little earlier this year Espinosa received a request
from one of his reliable Cuban contacts in Europe, asking that
he come there quickly, Espinosa went to Miami, obtained falas
Cubsen papers, and went to Paris, There, apparently in the
Presence of the Cuban Ambassador to France, he met one of the.

top security" man of the Castro rezime, who lad come to Paris
for that purpose, During various neetings, beth in France end.

in Spain (which Espinosa entered illegally), Espinosa was in-
formed that there is a plan to overthrow the Cestro regime
and to kill Castro and some of his main leaders, The plot is
ed by Cubele@ and some of the March 13 Movement, plua (I be-
lieve) some military officers, They must move very quickly
because more and more people are learning of the plot and
there is growing risk cf exposure, They are anxious to have
some coordinstion, or at least cor ::ltation, wich responsible
Acaricans, They are not confident that they could win an all-
out fight against the Castro forces, and are thinking more in
terms of taking contrvl for a short time (perhaps only a few
hours), killing Castro and-his wost: effective men (thus 9 o>
ruining the Castro movement forever), and then trying to hold
out for as long as feasible, It is esgential that they know
what, if anything, the Americans might do to help, now and/or
later, when the coup is attempted. Also, they wished to alert
the United States Government to what was being planned.

running out, Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,
cautiously asking whether there has been some “response”,

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off. Meanwhile,
the Cubsn who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to
return, Espinosa keeps waiting to hear whether the Americans
will play ball with the Cubelag group. The plot has lasted
for ovey 18 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very
goon no matter whether the Americans "play ball" or not, Ons
reason is that they almost have to go ahead now, for tie plot
will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless,

spinosa also referred to a jeweler by the name of

teppdd Ano (spelling?), located at 47th Street, in New York
City. Teppeklino worke for CIA and has frequent contact with
the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris, The Ambassador regularly dis~
poses of jewelry and other valuables made available from Cuba,
He does this through Teppéllino, However, the latter fools
— Yor example, the Ambassador agrees to sell for $80,000.

‘eppeliino informs CIA the price is $110,000, and, quietly
pentces the difference, On the other hand, Teppeliino and
CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for
CIA, but the Ambassador does know,

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous
situation of the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level
official in the United States Government unless he receives
at least some reply from CIA.

Comment:

Espinosa was not overly tense aud did not indulge in hise
trfonics, but I felt he was quits determined to puch thie
matter further if he did not get some response within the very
near future, I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reii-
ability on the basis of this one conversation, However, if *

id to guess at thie point I would be inclined to accept mo
what he said sbout actuel events, Sut of course thera are
@ll sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocation,

In accordance with what we agreed on, while Espinosa wae
