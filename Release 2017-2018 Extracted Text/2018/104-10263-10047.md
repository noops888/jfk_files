In Spain (which Espinosa entered Illegally), Espinosa was In-

formed that there is a plan to overthrow the Cestro regime

and to kill Castro and some of his main leaders.

The plot 1s

ied by Cubelad and some of the March 13 Movement, plus (I be-

leve some military officers.

They must move very quickly

becmuse more and more people are learning of the plot and

there is growing risk of exposure. They are anxious to have

some coordination, or at least con iltation, wich responsible

Araricans.

They are not confident that they could win an all-

out fight against the Castro forces, and are thinking more in

terms of taking contrul for a short cime (perhapa only a few

hours), killing Castro and his most effective men (tius

ruining the Castro novement forever), and then trying to hold

out for an long as feasible.

It is essential that they know

what, 1f anything, the Americans might do to help, now and/or

Inter, when the coup 1a attempted.

Also, thay wished to alert

the United States Government to what was being planned.

Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,

cautlously asking whether there has been some "response"

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off. Meanwhile,

the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to

return.

Espinosa keeps waiting to hear whether the Americans

will play ball with the Cubela group. The plot has lasted

will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

Espinona also referred to a jeweler by the name of

Teppellino (spelling?), located at 47th Street, In New York

city.

Teppe)kIino worka for CIA and has frequent contact with

the Cuban Ambassador, in Parie.

The Ambassador regularly dia

poses of jewelry and other valumbles made available from Cuba.

He does this through Teppellino. However, the latter fools

sa. for example, the Ambassador agrees

to sell for $80,000.

Teppelino Informa Can tha price 1a $110,000, and, quietly

pockets the difference.

On the other hand,

TeppelIlno and

CIA think the Cuban Ambanador does not know he is working for

CIA, but che Ambassador does Inow.

Espinown fu determined to bring the very dangerous

thia was not the sort of thing we got into.

However, I added

that I would see to it that someone called him. I further

Bald that, unofficially, I had enjoyed talking wich him.

by this, lowever, I doubt very much that he will wait longer

then swo or three days more before making another attempt to

bring this situntion to a head.
