MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Management Staff (U)

FROM: Frederick C. Randall (C)
Chief, IMS Privacy and Information
Action Group

1. (U) On 24 March 1978, I was interrogated
for one and one-half hours by Mr. Harold Leap and
Mr. Dan Hardway, staff members of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations. |_I answered all questions
truthfully. Immediately prior to being introduced
to the HSCA staff members, I was shown a copy of
the attached letter to the Committee giving permission
for. me to be questioned, and a copy of the attached
letter from the DDCI which discusses security
procedures. I asked for and received copies of the
two documents. Prior to the 24 March interrogation,
I was told by SA/DO/O that my personnel files had
been made available to the Committee.

2. (U) After being asked questions regarding
my CIA career, it became apparent that the staff
members were trying to establish that personnel
assigned to [came FO the early 1960's
had knowledge of an alleged. CIA connection to Lee
Harvey Oswald. I was asked when I first heard of
the assassination of President Kennedy, when I first
heard of Lee Harvey Oswald, etc. I-was asked to supply
many details of the organization, personnel, and
operation of the during the period of
my tour there -- from 1961 through 1965.

3. (8) In the context of my previous assign-
ment to the former Domestic Operations Division
beginning in 1965, I was asked twice in a most
forcible fashion whether. I knew Howard Hunt, to which

also asked if I was employed in the section of the
* Domestic Operations Division which handled covert :
action activities targetted against. the United States.
I.replied that CIA does not run CA operations against
- U.S. targets.

4. (U) Although I had heard a rumor that the
interrogation was based on allegations by a former
finance clerk assigned to the ia the staff
members would not provide me with any information
regarding the purpose of their investigation or of
their lead. The New York Times article of 27 March
1978, attached, reports the Wilcott allegations
together with the information that the lead came from
Philip Agee, and that Wilcott was represented at a
committee hearing by Agee's attorney.

5. (U) Although CIA has been an easy mark for
anyone looking for a cheap headline during the past
three years, my reaction to this situation is ‘that
the rights of many Americans, including current and
former employees of CIA, are being violated by the
procedures of this investigation. I can easily draw
a conclusion from the Times article that the HSCA is
unwittingly performing destruction work conceived by
Agee and his backers. I also wonder how any investi-
gation can be based on such flimsy evidence. #-reseft’

my,,permission.”” Finally,.1.do not like. being shown
an unclassified letter. concerning.me (I am under’ |
cover), which had already been sent to the Congress

without my knowledge. “

6. (C) I have asked that any notes made by
Mr. Leap and Mr. Hardway that are taken from the CIA
Headquarters building. use my alias, Frederick
Reynolds. I hope that this request is carried out.
