was terminated without prejudice in July 1966. On 23 July 1962

VECIANA was interviewed, at his request, by Mr. Harry. Real from

the DCD New. York office.

VECIANA asked Real to arrange a meeting

with a senior CIA officer to discuss

Alpha-66's plans to

assassinatc

Castro and to request CIA's assistance (U:S. $100,000; 10,000 Cuban

pesos; 48 hand grenades). There is no indication that this request
