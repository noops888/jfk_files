and also requested four MI rifle$ with adapters. for grenades plus
eight grenades. The COS did not: encourage VECIANA and subsequently
checked. with an Embassy officer who reported that VECIANA had made
similar "wild-eycd" proposals to him. On 23 November 1961 the
Miami News published a report of an unsuccessful attempt by Antonio
VECIANA to kill Castro. VECIANA reportedly had arranged to
assassinate Castro and. Cuban. President Osvaldo Dorticos on $ October
-in Havana, but the bazooka-he was using-failed to fire.
