The Attorney General

NOTE:

The Attorney General, on 8/8/75, and the Deputy
Attorney General, met with Associate Director Nicholas P. Callahan,
Assistant Director VW’, Raymond V/annall, and Inspector John B. Hotis
to discuss the request of the Senate felect Committee for the identities
of sources utilized to effect Cointelpro activities. The Attorney General
indicated prior to discussing this problem, which relates to the over-
all confidentiality of 781 sources, with fenator Church, Chairman of
the Committee, he desired to be furnished information which would
enable him to insure himself there were no Cointelpro activities of a
scandalous or infamous nature which at a later date could cause em-
barrassment to the Department, The attached memorandum was
prepared during the period 8/8-12/75 by personnel of the Internal
Security Branch of the Intelligence Division. it represents a careful
review of all Cointelpro actions where results were known. It is
pointed out in the majority of authorized Cointelpro actions results
were not recorded. Also, because of the wide variety of Cointelpro
actions, results in many areas are not subject to measurement, For
example, there is no way of determining how many individuals left the

Comuunist Party as a result of our documented mailings relating to
£oviet anti-semitism,

David Hilliard. This commnication, matled September 17, 1969,

_ would question the death of BPP member "Brother Michael Baynhem,"
who it was believed committed suicide and would raise the question ~
-of possible responsibility on the part of national BPP leaders for
the suicide. The letter would also be prepared in a manner to
cause suspicion that, Jackie Spicer, a BPP leader in Detroit, was —
the author ef the letter and thus cause disruption in the BFP.

On September 19, 1969, an informant advised the receipt
ef the letter by Detroit BPP personnel convinced thea that Jackie
Spicer and Anite Hartman (also BPP member) wrote the letter, As a
result, Frank Meyers of the Detroit Chapter contacted BPP Netional
. Headquarters on Septesber 18, 1969, to ao advise them. As a result,
Meyers was told to stay away from Spicer since she was probably a-.
police informant and the letter had come from the police through her.-

At a BPP meeting held September 18, 1969, a decision was
- made te confront Spicer regarding the letter and consequently, she
and Anita Hartmen were purged from the Datroit BPP group.

in February, 1971, the Seattle Office advised that the
zollowing action was taken to discredit Michael Thomas Justesen
and Clayton Van Lydeprar asong their fellow New Leit associates.
During December, 1570, in connection with the “Seattie 3” trial,
it was apparent that the defendants and their attorneys were
under the impression that the Government intended to uncover
other indgormants in addition to the one who was surfaced vor
testimoay. (Zhe “Seattle 6" is u name coined by aews nedia to
describe eight persons indicted py a Federal Grand Jury at
Seattle, Washington, on April 16, 1970, for violation
or the anti~riot law aud conspiracy to destroy Covernneat
property.} Although there was general speculation that one
of the defendants was a Government informant, this was not
true. The Government had no othex informants to uncover.
koliowing the declaration of « mistrial in the case, ax
anonymous call was made to Defense Counsel JeSirey Steinbora.
(the mistrial was declared as 2 result ot actions by 2 detendant
who was cited ior contempt.) ‘dhe auonymous caller oifered to
help stelnborn in defense of the case but releted a fear that
Steinborn's phone might be bugged. Steinbora was instructed ta

noted that Pitkin handled the Government's case concerning the
UWSeattlo 3,° and aiso received considerable publicity ia 19790
in connection with an expose oi police corruption beicre the
Federal Graod Jury.) The anonymous calicr advised hihi that

(Justesen was in fugitive status at the time and Van Lydegralts
whereabouts were not known.) In reality neither was an informant.
United States Attorney Pitkin was not aware of the above action.

AS a result, Steinborn conironted Pitkin a Yew nonths
later and warned that disclosure during any tuture trial that one

Government's case. Fitkin denied any knowledge that the FEE might
have an undisciosed informant within the “Seattie 8." Information

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Operations (83CIo)
concerning allegations by Gamuel Adason Jaffe that vindictive
actions taken by the FBI have prevented him from obtaining or
keeping a job in the new a field, Accerding to the 10
representative, Jaffe reported that he had a pleasant relationship
with Special Agents of the FBI during the time he had furnished
information regarding Soviet intelligence matters; however, he
detected a coolness of these FBI Agents towards him after his
return from Hong Kong in 1968. He attributed thig coolness to
his being "fingered" by Soviet defector Oleg V. Penkovskiy, who
allegedly reported that he sew Jaffe's name om a plece of paper
on the desk of a Boviet intelligence officer. Upon learning
this, the FBE fett that Jaffe was a double egent, Since his
return from Hong Kong he cannot hold a job and believes the

PBI is the cause of his predicauent. The former Special Agent

of the FBE advised that the 8SC10 representative told him he _

is looking into this satter to determine if Jaffe's statements -
are true and to determine if some controls could be created —
so that the FaY could not be vindictive in similar situations.c

’ to information from a former 819 officer currently residing in

the West, Jaffe in about 1961, while in Moscow, waa reeruited —
by the Committee for State Security (KGB). Our investigation
regarding thie allegation has failed to either substantiate

or refute this allegation. Jaffe, however, in 1963 reported

‘to our New York Office that while in Moscow, he was approached

in what he considered an attempt at recruitment by the S18.

INTERVIEW OF \SPECIAL AGENT EARL M. PETERSEN
BY SSC STAFF ER

Special Agent (SA) Earl_M. Petersen was interviewed
at the San Diego office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) on July 31,1975, by U. S. Senate Select Committee (SSC)
Staff Member Lester Seidel. The interview began at 10:05 A.M.
and ended at 11:35 A.M. Assistant Special Agent in Charge
(ASAC) Arthur G. Barger was available nearby for consulta-
tion. He was not consulted during the interview.

Prior to the interview, SA Petersen had been
advised by San Diego FBI officials that FBI Headquarters
had waived the employee agreement not to furnish informa-
tion for the purpose of this interview. He was advised
that he had a right to counsel but that the FBI was unable
to provide private counsel for him.

SA Petersen was advised that he would not be
required to answer questions that might divulge the identity
of any FBI source; that would reveal information relative to
sensitive methods and techniques; or information which
originated with other agencies, including foreign intelligence
agencies.

SA Petersen was advised that the interview was to
involve only the COINTELPRO as it applied to the Black Panther
Party (BPP) (see appendix).

Staff Member Lester Seidel identified himself to
SA Petersen and stated that he was not warning SA Petersen
of his rights as the interview was such that such a warning
was not required. He advised SA Petersen that he did not
have to talk to him and that any information furnished was
on a voluntary basis. He stated that information furnished
to him would be handled with discretion.

Mr. Seidel: Were you in charge of the
COINTELPRO in San Diego from
March, 1968 through October, 1968?

SA Petersen: This was possible but the
dates the program was assigned
to me are not recalled.

Mr. Seidel: What was the name of the squad
to which you were assigned at
that time?

SA Petersen: The Security Squad.

Mr. Seidel: Who did the squad investigate? -

Was it groups such as US, Inc.
(see appendix) and the BPP?

SA Petersen: Yes, such groups as US, Inc.,
the BPP, and the Nation of
Islam (NOL) (see appendix).

Mr. Seidel: And possibly splinter groups?

SA Petersen: Yes, groups that would form
and disband and which could
possibly be called splinter
groups.

How long have you been in
the Bureau?

Twenty-four years as of
June 25, 1975.

Where have you been assigned?

In Boston, Baltimore, New
York, Tampa, and San Diego.

The Bureau has indicated that
you were a coordinator of the
COINTELPRO in San Diego. As
such, what were your duties?

The duties for the most part
consisted of preparing letters
to the Bureau asking for
authority to take some specific
action in the program; awaiting
the reply from the Bureau; and
then, if any action was taken,
to advise the Bureau of the
results of such action. It

is noted that many of the re-
quests to take specific action
were turned down by the Bureau.

Were you the focal point of
the program?

Yes, in the sense that any

idea for action to be taken

in the program was trans-

mitted to the Bureau for
approval by me and if approval
was received, it would be re-
lated to whomever had suggested
the activity. I would then
report any results to the Bureau.

Mr. Seidel: Did you get heavy pressure from
Bureau officials to take action
in this program?

SA Petersen: Not any more than any other
case, and I had a number of
other cases assigned to me
at the time the COINTELPRO
was assigned to me.

Mr. Seidel: beta type of things did you
iO
SA Petersen: I do not recall at this time

any specific action taken in
the program. I do recall that
a Black Panther leader, Walter
Wallace, was removed as leader
of the party in San Diego. I
believe it was suspected that
he might have cooperated with
the FBI. This could have been
accomplished by interviewing
him where the interview could
be seen by other party members.
If the Agents shook his hand,
smiled, and acted like he was
a friend, it might plant the
seed of suspicion in the minds
of other BPP members. I do
not recall specifically whethe
this happened but at any rate,
Wallace was not trusted and
was removed as leader of the
party.

Mr. Seidel: Could such a thing get Wallace
killed or injured?

I do not see how it would
because there would be no way
anyone could determine whether
or not Wallace was, in fact,
cooperating with the FBI. He
was probably removed by the

BPP as a precautionary measure.

I cannot recall whether or

not Wallace was removed while

I was coordinator of the program.

Was COINTELPRO successful?

IT was not too impressed with
its success in San Diego while
I had it assigned to me be-~
cause it was a new program

and it took some time to get
it established and working.
Most of the success was probably
due to information obtained
regarding criminal violations,
mostly local in nature, which
was furnished to local law
enforcement officers, causing
the arrest of BPP members.

This would have been done
whether or not we had a
COINTELPRO. It was necessary
to prepare a letter to the
Bureau asking authority to

take action and then wait

for a reply authorizing the
activity. Many times suggested
COINTELPRO activity suggestions
would be turned down.

Mr. Seidel made available Xerox copies of Bureau
letters captioned, "Counter-Intelligence Program; Black
Nationalist - Hate Groups," dated August 25, 1967 and
March 4, 1968. These were read by SA Petersen, who said he
could not specifically recall reading the letters.

Mr. Seidel: Was contact with the police
formal or informal?

SA Petersen: Contact was personal or telephonic
contact and at one time, informa-
tion furnished to individual officers
was confirmed by letter to the
Chef of Police. It is not re-
called if this was the policy
during the time COINTELPRO was
assigned to me.

Mr. Seidel: What happened to SA Roy Burns?

SA Petersen: He was transferred to the Butte,
Montana Field Office.

Mr. Seidel: Did he do anything wrong? I
understand Agents were sometimes
transferred to Butte as a disci-

plinary measure.

SA Petersen: SA Burns wanted to be transferred
to Butte and requested the trans-
fer. The Special Agent in Charge

there and may have helped SA
Burns get moved there. .

Mr. Seidel: Were the BPP and US, Inc. both

SA Petersen: , I believe SA Burns had it then.

Mr. Seidel: What were the cartoons?

SA Petersen: I recall seeing them but do not

recall any specific cartoon.

Mr. Seidel: Do you think anything done in
COINTELPRO could have had a
reaction causing someone to kill
an individual in the other group?

SA Petersen: Because of the extreme antagonism 1
between the two groups, anything
we did would have had about the
same effect as a gnat biting an
elephant. I do not think COINTELPRO
had that kind of impact.

Did you ever supervise any techni-

surveillance of the BPP in San
Diego?

No. I don't recall anything like
that being done here.

How would you feel about writing
a letter to a wife saying her
husband was sleeping with various
other women if the husband was a
BPP leader?

I would hesitate to do this
because it might break up a
family. If the facts were true
and this might cause the BPP
leader to be less effective, it
would probably be a good counter-
intelligence move.

I am referring to Page 91 of a

BPP COINTELPRO summary which
indicates that a BPP leader was
living with a white girl and an
anonymous letter was written to
others in the BPP saying that this
individual was living with a white
girl, Do you recall anything about

I believe that leader could have
been Kenneth Denmon in San Diego.

Diego was teaching children to
hate and kill police officers.
They planned violent criminal
acts and were making plans to
take over the established govern-
ment at the first opportunity.

If a leader of such a group could
be discredited and removed, it
would help to keep the group from
becoming stronger, as they would
have to select a new leader, and
he would have to get the group
reorganized. Denmon had many
additional weaknesses which could
be used in a counter-intelligence
program.

Do you recall a letter being sent
to BPP Headquarters saying a
leader of the BPP was cooperating
with the police in Los Angeles?

I do not recall such a letter.

Do you recall some cards being
sent to San Diego from Los Angeles
saying, "Ron Karenga is impotent"?

No, I do not recall such cards.
Ron Karenga was a leader of US,
Inc., not the BPP.

Do you recall that cartoons were
to be sent to BPP members to dis-
eredit the leaders?

I recall the cartoons but do not

recall whether they were set to
BPP members.

to see such restrictive legislation
passed that at some time in the
future when we might be faced
with violence-prone organizations
trying to take control of the
government, we would be unable to
properly handle our responsibility
for the internal security of the
United States.

Thank you for your cooperation.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
Formerly Known As
Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby
George Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing
black people to take control of the life, politics and destiny
of the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program
to end the oppression of the black people but since early
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercommunal
Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California,

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. S, Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order, Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change
the American Government by any means necessary but that
ultimately such change will be through armed violence,

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's continued ettraction to violence persist.
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been
arrested in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor, Newton failed to appear on these charges
and is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and
three were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-~sponsored
dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974,

Also Known As
"US", Incorporated

"US" was chartered by the State of California as
a@ non-profit corporation in September, 1966, with offices
at 8211 South Broadway, Los Angeles, California. The
corporation alleges that "US" is primarily an Afro-
American cultural organization.

During the spring of 1968, however, a source
advised that MAULANA RON KARENGA, true name RONIE MC KINLEY
EVERETT, Founder-Chairman of "US", published a booklet
entitled "The Quotable Karenga", in which he talked of
revolution, black power, and condemned Christianity for the
plight of the black man.

In this booklet, KARENGA stated "...You must have
a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The
cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.
...The revolution being fought now is a revolution to win
the minds of our people. If we fail to win this, we cannot
wage the violent one. ...When the word is given, we'll
see how tough you are. When it's 'burn', let's see how much
you blow up. And when it's 'take that white girl's head
too', well see how tough you are..."

The above source advised that "US" members are
required to study and memorize this booklet. "US" members
are also assigned Swahili names which they use in lieu
of their given names.

A second source advised that KARENGA had i
spoken at various meetings in Los Angeles at which time he
talked of creating an "US" army of 1,000 men, obtaining
weapons and ammunition, guerrilla warfare tactics, and
revolution. KARENGA also stated "The only way to get
life is to take a life and as we get stronger, we will
take what we want from the white man's United States."
He also stated that if the police killed any "US" members,
the "US" organization would kill somé of them.

APPENDIX CONTINUED

The first source above advised that KARENGA
also stated that race riots throughout the country
were not riots but were actually revolts or revolutions
and that the black people were going to win their
freedom by violence, if necessary.

A third source advised that KARENGA stated
that a revolution would take place in the future and
that no one can believe in black revolution without
believing in armed conflict because the two go hand in hand.

A fourth source advised in August, 1974, that the
US Organization has been evicted from its headquarters at
4302 South Crenshaw Boulevard, Los Angeles, and because
of lack of funds, has been unable to locate a new meeting
place. The organization has terminated all public meetings.

NATION OF ISLAM (NOI)
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION
EXTREMIST MATTER

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a black nationwife
organization headquartered at Muhammad's Temple #2, 7351
South Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, Elijah
Muhammad, self-styled "Messenger of- Allah" and divinely
appointed leader of the black race in America, was ieader
of the NOI until his death on February 25, 1975, at which
time his son, Wallace D. Muhammad, became Supreme Minister
of the NOI. The NOI seeks a separate black nation, espouses
its own version of the Islamic Religion, and has considered
all "whites" to be devils; however, Wallace D. Muhammad
in an interview published in "Muhammad Speaks", March 21, 1975,
same being a weekly and the official NOI newspaper, stated
there would no longer be stress put on the white people's
status as "devils"; that whites have "begun to reform" and
"The past is the past until it is dug up. We will not
dig it up." NOI official policy instructs members to obey
laws of the United States that do not conflict with NOI
laws; to defend NOI officials, property, women, and them-
selves at all costs, if attacked; and to disarm any
attacker and use the attacker's weapon against him.

The NOI body is broken down into: 1) the Fruit of
Islam (FOI); an all male military-type group, to which
instruction in judo and karate is given, and which has as
its mmission security of officials, membership, and property
of the NOI, and enforcing discipline in the NOI; and 2)
the Muslim Girls Training (MGT), an all female quasi
military-type group which has as its mission homemaking and
child guidance in accordance with NOI teachings.

NOI activity is widespread among black inmates in
many prisons in the United States. In recent years internal
dissidence and difficulties with rival.Muslim groups and
other adversaries have produced considerable violence, some
involving physical confrontations and-acts of violence with
law enforcement agencies.

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT
(SA) LAWRENCE F. WIRICK BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

On July 31, 1975, at 11:45 a.m. Mr. Lester Seidel
of the United States Senate Select Committee (SSC) interviewed
SA Lawrence F, Wirick at the San Diego Office of the FBI.
No Advice of Rights was furnished SA Wirick and it was not
necessary for the interviewee to consult with an FBI representative.
The interview was terminated at 12:50 p.m. and as’ best recalled
included the following discussion in the form of questions and
answers

Seidel: You understand that this is an informal interview
and is in connection with the Bureau's COINTELPRO
as it relates to the FBI investigation of the BPP?

Wirick: Yes, but for what purpose is the Senate conducting
this survey?

Seidel: To aid in formation of new legislation so that the
FBI and other Government agencies will have more
definite guidelines to follow.

Wirick: I believe the Congress already through lack of
i information, isolated instances and some hysteria
has ~ enacted too many restrictive laws that prevent
the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting
the law abiding element of our society from the
"bad guys".

Seidel: (He was in general agreement) Did you_handle the
COINTELPRO from 1970 through March, 1971?

Wirick: Yes, but I believe the BPP ceased to function locally
about November or December, 1970. As I recall my
function was to write a progress type letter regarding
progress which described the illegal activities of
members of the BPP and to report that this information
had been furnished local police agencies but information
generally emanated from confidential informants.

Seidel:

Wirick:

What type of illegal activities and did your program
in any way instigate illegal activities on the part
of the BPP?

Criminal acts committed by local members of the BPP

are what I was referring to. I don't believe it was
ever necessary to instigate any illegal acts or in

any way entrap BPP members in criminal acts. The
majority of local BPP members were thieves, narcotics
addicts, lazy, unemployed and were hero worshipers of
the BPP in Oakland, California. They wanted to emulate
the Oakland organization, but their own dishonesty,

et cetera, was a constant source of turmoil amongst
the local group.

I recall, date unknown, information was received
regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denmon), one time
head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit
cards.

Information was received that Walter Wallace

(Walter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that

he and his wife, Velma, were stealing to get money

for narcotics and that Velma's mother was also involved
in local thefts.

All above information was furnished local law agencies
and local arrests were made. Furnishing the

above type of information is a function and responsibility
of the FBI.

The BPP in San Diego was very effective in causing
their own problems and their own extinction and their
criminal activities were not restricted to the examples
I've given.

Seidel: Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast
Program?

Wirick: Wo, not to my knowledge. I recall that soon after
the Breakfast Program was started that other members
of the BPP accused Ken Denmon of stealing money from
contributions made to the Program.

On second thought I believe we did disrupt the BPP
Breakfast Program in that we received complaints

from several dairys and bread companies, et cetera,

that they had been approached by BPP members with
veiled threats of extortion if they did not donate
quantities of food,et cetera,to the BPP Breakfast
Program. The FBI and local police investigated and

I believe as a result their practices were discontinued,
but the investigation failed to establish a prosecutable
offense of extortion.

Seidel: Did you have any connection with distribution of
"cartoons" depicting BPP members as compromising each
other, et cetera?

Wirick: No, but I have seen "cartoons" in the BPP newspaper.
Have you ever seen or read copies of the BPP newspaper?

Seidel: No

They featured "cartoons" showing the "pigs" (police)
being killed, stabbed, et cetera. I believe I recall
seeing some "cartoons" showing how the BPP would kill
the “honkies" (white people). They were similar to
the propaganda leaflets used by the Nazis against
American troops before an attack, The articles in the
BPP newspaper were even more foul.

Did the COINTELPRO promote disserion between the BPP
and the US Group (see Appendix page)?

Not to my knowledge. As I recall there was never

any need to. They were constantly at odds with each
other and on a gang type basis were trying to eliminate
each other, I believe Sylvester Bell, a San Diego BPP
member was killed by an US Group member and John Savage,
ee local BPP member was killed by an US Group
member,

In Los Angeles two other BPP members, names not
recalled, were allegedly killed by US Group members.

I believe this led to the popular saying in Southeast
San Diego section where most blacks live that the score
(game) was, "US 4 - BPP 0".

What do you think of the merits of a proposal to
spray shipments of the BPP newspaper with a noxious
acid so that readers would be confronted with a vile
odor when attempting to read the paper?

Wirick:

After thought, no. Because the paper itself was

so vile and anti-white that the odor would never

stop BPP members from reading same. I've always
hoped that a large segment of the population,
especially the "do~gooders" could or would experience
the nauseous reaction I have felt after reading the
illiterate, foul-mouthed, anti-white, anti-Government,
BPP paper. I think everybody should read a copy of
the BPP paper so that they will know the type and
character of BPP members,

What do you think about anonymous letters sent to
spouses of BPP members saying the husband was sleeping
with a white girl, et cetera?

Most wives of the members I recall were also BPP
members and/or common-law-wives. Many BPP members

did have liaison with white girls but I doubt if

such a letter would bother most spouses of BPP members.
However, such a letter might be of value under certain
circumstances, example: the stories that were spread
during World War II which were not necessarily all true
regarding Hitler, Mussolini, General Patton and others.

In your opinion was the COINTELPRO of any value?
Should it be changed? Do you have any suggestions
for changes, or should it be eliminated completely?

Yes, as I recall, it acted as a progress letter of the
BPP, its direction, its dissen¥ion, its change in
leadership, and indications of its slow local demise
because of the character of the local BPP members, and
as a summary of its activities for FBIHQ. I recall that

we made certain requests to conduct some types
of counterintelligence against the BPP, but I
do not recall that the Bureau ever authorized any
counterintelligence act which might be productive.

Ghange? COINTELPRO is not being utilized to the
best of my knowledge and has not been for some time.

I believe that in about two or three years Congress
will be frantically asking the FBI why we did not
furnish them intelligence, advance knowledge of a
demonstration, a riot and other civil unrest and
elimination of the COINTELPRO has been another step
in the direction of placing the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies in a position where we cannot
react to the activities of groups such as the BPP
which have been formed with the main purpose

of overthrowing the United States.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Staff Member Seidel identified himself to Mr.
Baker, stating that the interview would be in the form of
an informal discussion and that information furnished by
Mr. Baker would be placed in a memorandum for the SSC.
Mr. Seidel stated that he did not intend to use the names
of individuals interviewed in his memorandum. He stated
that Mr. Baker did not have to talk to him, and that any
information he furnished would be furnished voluntarily.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker was a supervisor
with the San Diego Office of the FBI from sometime in 1968
through April, 1971.

Mr. Baker advised that he was a supervisor of the
security squad but could not recall if the dates mentioned
by Mr. Seidel were correct. :

Mr. Seidel inquired as to the nature of matters
supervised by him, to which Mr. Baker replied that matters
such as investigation of the Communist Party (see appendix),
the Socialist Workers Party (see appendix), the Black Panther
Party, US, Incorporated (see appendix), the Nation of Islam

see appendix), Espionage, Sabotage matters, and other investi-
gations were conducted on the squad supervised by him, which
consisted of from 12 to 15 Special Agents.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker
supervised the COINTELPRO.

Mr. Baker advised that he did supervise this pro-
gram which was initiated by FBI Headquarters and not on the
field office level. He stated that as he recalled, a letter
was submitted either monthly, quarterly or semi-annually.
The letter was submitted by a Special Agent whose case load
was such that he could take the time to prepare the letter.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Special Agent
Roy Burns was more of a young, eager, type Agent.

Mr. Baker replied that this was not true but
that Special Agent Burns had been assigned the COINTELPRO
case because his case load was such that he was able to
handle the program. :

Mr. Seidel inquired whether Special Agent Roy
Burns was transferred to the Butte Office of the FBI for
disciplinary reasons.

Mr. Baker replied that Special Agent Burns was
originally from Washington State and had wanted to be trans-
ferred to that area. :

Mr. Seidel asked if the Bureau encouraged Agents
to participate in disruptive programs and then rewarded them
financially for their efforts.

Mr. Baker replied that the Bureau had an incentive
award program, and if an Agent did a good job in any field, he
could get recognition through an incentive award. Mr. Baker
stated that he could not recall any award being given as a
result of GOENTELPRO activity.

Mr. Seidel asked Mr. Baker if he could recall any
information concerning the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP.

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that the operation
of the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP was followed through
sources. They advised that some of the BPP officials were
stealing money from funds which were to be spent on the
breakfast program. The breakfast program was served at a
local Catholic church. Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that
an official of the Catholic church in San Diego was contacted
regarding the priest in charge of the church where the break-
fast program was being held, who was reportedly an alcoholic.
Mr. Seidel was advised that the priest was transferred from
the church.

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel asked what Mr. Baker's definition of
the COINTELPRO was.

Mr. Baker replied that the COINTELPRO was a
disruptive type program.

Mr. Seidel stated that the FBI had apparently
written a letter regarding a white girl friend of Kenneth
Denman, a BPP leader in San Diego. He inquired as to why
this letter was written.

Mr. Baker stated that Denman was considered one
of the stronger leaders of the San Diego Branch of the BPP,
and if it was possible to keep him from becoming a strong
leader, .it would be disruptive to the party. The fact that
Denman was living with a white girl was considered derogatory
toward him by BPP members in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether such activity.
would have been taken against a leader in an organization
such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
(see description) if the leader of such a group had been
living with a white woman. Would such a letter be appropriate?

Mr. Baker replied that he did not feel that such a
letter would be appropriate in this case because this organi-
zation involved a religious leader and our program was not
directed at religious groups but was directed toward black
militant and extremist groups.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker recalled
individuals in the BPP named Tate, Wallace, Denman and Bell.

Mr. Baker stated that he could not recall anything
specific about any of these individuals, except what he had
previously stated concerning Denman. He said he could recall
the names but nothing more concerning these individuals.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then mentioned an incident wherein the
San Diego Office of the FBI had furnished information to the
Los Angeles Office of the FBI for transmission to local auth-
orities concerning a group of BPP members from San Diego who
were traveling to Los Angeles to attend a funeral.

Mr. Baker stated that he could recall that such an
incident occurred and that information was furnished stating
that BPP members from San Diego would be carrying concealed
weapons. He said he thought the furnishing of this information
resulted in some of the BPP members being arrested in Los

Angeles.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker could
recall someone from the FBI in San Diego visiting the mother
of a girl who was an alleged member of the BPP in San Diego,
and whether the FBI went to the mother to put pressure on
another member of the family.

Mr. Baker stated that he vaguely recalled such a
case but could not recall the details and could not be
certain this had occurred.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether the FBI had any
technical surveillances on the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Baker stated that he knew of none and added that
such coverage was not needed in San Diego because there were
good sources in the BPP who could furnish excellent coverage.
Mr. Baker stated that he believes he would have known of any
such installations covering the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker knew of San Francisco
using any such techniques against the BPP.

Mr. Baker replied that he believed that San Fran-
cisco had used such techniques.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then asked why such techniques were
not used in San Diego if they were used in San Francisco.

Mr. Baker replied that such techniques were not
needed in San Diego due to the good source coverage of
party activity. : :

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether there was a
cr peeina between US, Incorporated, and the BPP in San
Diego.

Mr. Baker replied that US, Incorporated, head-
quarters were in Los Angeles. There was a power struggle
between the two groups for membership of blacks and much
travel occurred by US, Incorporated, leaders from Los
Angeles to San Diego and Mexico, and from San Diego to
Los Angeles. There were considerable conflict between the
two groups.

Mr. Seidel asked whether Mr. Baker recalled
Ron Karenga.

Mr. Baker replied that he did recall Ron Karenga
as being the Los Angeles leader of US, Incorporated.

Mr. Seidel asked whether Mr. Baker recalled some
cards stating "Ron Karenga is impotent" which were printed
in Los Angeles and some of which might have been sent to
San Diego.

Mr. Baker replied that he does not recall these
cards but this could have been correct.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker recalled some cartoons
being drawn concerning the BPP.

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that there were
two or three cartoons prepared depicting strife between US,
Incorporated, and the BPP.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then stated that these cartoons were
prepared by the Bureau Laboratory.

Mr. Baker stated that he did not recall.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that US, Incorporated,
and the BPP were led by and made up of people with extensive
eriminal records, and because of this and their general
demeanor, the FBI did not really have to provoke or dis-
rupt them because they kept themselves in a constant state
of turmoil. He stated that Special Agents connected with
the COINTELPRO did not devote much time to the program be-
cause of heavy case loads of other matters and because they
assisted in working criminal matters such as bank robberies
and other criminal violations.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that a great deal of
time was spent by the Special Agents working with their
sources because they had to be extremely careful that they
were protected. If a crime was planned and a sowce had
knowledge of it, the source would try to keep the crime from
being committed. If it was not possible to prevent the crime,
the source might be forced to participate, and if arrested, a
problem would becreated in attempting to get the source out
of jail and still conceal his identity as a source.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Mr. Baker as to the names of
the Agents he dealt with in Los Angeles and San Francisco in
connection with COINTELPRO,

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that Supervisor
Albert Clark had something to do with the program in San
Francisco, and in Los Angeles he dealt with Supervisor Richard
Bloeser and Bill Knowland.

Mr. Seidel asked Mr. Baker if he was acquainted

Mr. Baker stated that Richard Held was assigned

knew him at that time. He stated that he is aware that
Richard Held is now the Special Agent in Charge of the
Chicago Office of the FBI.

Mr. Seidel stated to Mr. Baker that he was going

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
Formerly Known As
Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby
George Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing
black people to take control of the life, politics and destiny
of the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program
to end the oppression of the black people but since early
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercommunal
Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. 8S, Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order, Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change
the American Government by any means necessary but that
ultimately such change will be through armed violence,

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been
arrested. in Gakland, California, for threatening police officers, ©
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor, Newton failed to appear on these charges
and is now a local fugitive, Additionally, one died and
three were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored-
dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

Title 50, U. S. Code, Section 781 (Internal Security
Act of 1950) stated that, as a result of evidence adduced
before various committees of the Senate and House of Representa~
tives, Congress found the existence of a world communist
revolutionary movement, whose purpose is to establish a
conmunist totalitarian dictatorship in the world's countries
through the medium of a world-wide communist organization.
Communist action organizations in various countries endeavor
to carry out the objectives of the world communist movement
by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by
any means. The communist organization in the United States -
the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) - pursuing its stated objectives,
presents "a clear and present danger to the security of the
United States." The Subversive Activities Control Board,

‘ established by Section 791 of the above Act, found the CPUSA

to be a communist action organization, This finding was

upheld by the United States Supreme Court in June, 1961, The
CPUSA has continued to be an arm of the international communist
movement dominated by the Soviet Union, The CPUSA, in its
dependence on the Soviet Union, has never knowingly adopted a
position contrary to Soviet policy. Its leaders frequently
confer with Soviet leaders to receive guidance and direction
on the policies the CPUSA is to follow. There has been no
evidence that the primary aims of the CFUSA, as they conform
to Soviet objectives, have changed over the years.

NATION OF ISLAM (NOT)
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION
EXTREMIST MATTER

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a black nationwife
organization headquartered at Muhammad's Temple #2, 7351
South Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Elijah
Muhammad, self-styled "Messenger of Allah" and divinely
appointed leader of the black race in America, was leader
of the NOI until his death on February 25, 1975, at which
time his son, Wallace D. Muhammad, became Supreme Minister
of the NOI. The NOI seeks a separate black nation, espouses
its own version of the Islamic Religion, and has considered
all "whites" to be devils; however, Wallace D. Muhammad
in an interview published in "Muhammad Speaks", March 21, 1975,
same being a weekly and the official NOI newspaper, stated
there would no longer be stress put on the white people's
status as "devils"; that whites have "begun to reform" and
"The past is the past until it is dug up. We will not
dig it up." NOI official policy instructs members to obey
laws of the United States that do not conflict with NOI
laws; to defend NOI officials, property, women, and them-
selves at all costs, if attacked; and to disarm any
attacker and use the attacker's weapon against him.

The ‘NOI body is broken down unto: 1) the Fruit of
Islam (FOI), an all male military-type group, to which
instruction in judo and karate is given, and which has as
its mmission security of officials, membership, and property
of the NOI, and enforcing discipline in the NOI; and 2)
the Muslim Girls Training (MGT), an ali female quasi
military-type group which has as its mission homemaking and
child guidance in accordance with NOI teachings.

NOI activity is widespread among black inmates in
many prisons in the United States. In recent years internal
dissidence and difficulties with rival Muslim groups and
other adversaries have produced considerable violence, some
involving physical confrontations and acts of violence with
‘law enforcement agencies.

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY

The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a revolutionary,
Trotskyist-communist organization, which is headquartered in
New York City. Its purpose, as stated in its Declaration of
Principles, is the overthrow of the U. S. Government and the
institution of a dictatorship of the working class and the
eventual achievement of a communist society. It was founded
in 1938 and maintains close association with international
Trotskyist organizations as a "sympathizing" group, but it
denies formal membership in any foreign group to escape
application of the Voorhis Act, which regulates certain
types of organizations subject to foreign control. While
the SWP does not openly advocate the use of violence at the
present time to overthrow the U. S. Government, it believes
that eventual violent revolution in the U. S. is inevitable. i
Its objection to the current use of violence is based on the
ground that it believes violence is premature at this time.
The SWP seeks to precipitate a revolution when conditions
are ripe and to seize control of the revolution and to direct
it when it occurs.

Also Known As
"US", Incorporated

"US" was chartered by the State of California as
a non-profit corporation in September, 1966, with offices
at 8211 South Broadway, Los Angeles, California. The
corporation alleges that "US" is primarily an Afro-
American cultural organization.

During the spring of 1968, however, a source
advised that MAULANA RON KARENGA, true name RONIE MC KINLEY
EVERETT, Founder-Chairman of "US", published a booklet
entitled "The Quotable Karenga", in which he talked of
revolution, black power, and condemned Christianity for the
plight of the black man.

In this booklet, KARENGA stated "...You must have
a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The
cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.
...The revolution being fought now is a revolution to win
the minds of our people. If we fail to win this, we cannot
wage the violent one. ...When the word is given, we'll
see how tough you are. When it's 'burn', let's see how much
you blow up. And when it's 'take that white girl's head
too', we'll see how tough you are..."

The above source advised that "US" members are
required to study and memorize this booklet. "US" members
are also assigned Swahili names which they use in lieu
of their given names.

.A second source advised that KARENGA had
spoken at various meetings in Los Angeles at which time he
talked of creating an "US" army of 1,000 men, obtaining
weapons and ammunition, guerrilla warfare tactics, and
revolution. KARENGA also stated "The only way to get
life is to take a life and as we get stronger, we will
take what we want from the white man's United States."
He also stated that if the police killed any "US" members,
the "US" organization would kill some of them.

The first source above advised that KARENGA
also stated that race riots throughout the country
were not riots but were actually revolts or revolutions
and that the black people were going to win their
freedom by violence, if necessary.

A third source advised that KARENGA stated
that a revolution would take place in the future and
that no one can believe in black revolution without
believing in armed conflict because the two go hand in hand.

A fourth source advised in August, 1974, that the
US Organization has been evicted from its headquarters at
4302 South Crenshaw Boulevard, Los Angeles, and because
of lack of funds, has been unable to locate a new meeting
place. The organization has terminated all public meetings.

NFORMATION C CERNING

Attached New York teletype advises of infornation , A
from former Bureau Agent, who is a current informative asset, we
that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Cperations
(SSCIO) has bocome aware of Jaffets allegations that the FBI |
has taken actions which have prevented him from obtaining or
keeping a job in the news media field. Jaffe claims t his teg
association with Bureau Agents with regard to Soviet intel-

ligence matters cooled off after he was identified by a Soviet \
efector as cooperating with Soviet Intelligence and that the z
FBI has since deprived him from making a living in his profes- \
sion. The SSCIO is looking into Jaffe's situation to determine
if his allegations are true and if the FBI can be prevented

from taking such actions in other similar situations. &

BACKGROUND:

DATE OF REVIEW.

Jaffe is a former correspondent for ABC and CBS
who was a symbol number informant of the New York. Office tron”
. During this period, he fwrnished ingoraation
on his numerous contacts with Soviet nationals whom he met
through his assignment as a CBS correspondent at the United
Nations. In 1961, he joined ARC as i correspondent in
Moscow where he served until he was e 1965 following
the publication of an erticle uni to the Soviet Union.
He was then transferred to Nong Kong where he remained until
1968. Since 1968, he has worked for vard ious news media and
has acted as a free lance journalist. Following his return

Memorandum to Mr. W. OR, Vamiatl
Re: Samuel Adason Jaffe
105~28333

Soviet defector sang advised that Jaffe was

recruited by the KGB, in about 1962 while he was, in Moscow,
through his relationship with a Soviet female. [Soviet de-
fector "Shamrock" has confirmed that Jaffe wag approached but
does not believe the approach was_ ces le Jafife reported
to the New York Office in 1963 what he preted as a recruit-
ment effort, and he was extensively reinterviewed in 1969
concerning his association with KGB officers in Moscow. [There
is no information in Jaffe's file that he was evér reported on
by Col. Penkovskiy, as Jaffe reportedly has claimed. During
the interviews with Jaffe, he denied any overt actS helpful

to the KGB, although he admitted a continuing relationship with
several KGB officers. Both the New York and Washington Field
Offices came to the conclusion that Jaffe was a KGB agent while
in Moscow, but that there was doubt as to whether he continued
in that role after he was expelled.

Our relations with Jaffe were tempered by ['Samny' =']¥ Jyh)
allegation, and Bureau Agents in contact with him were circum:
spect in any dealings with him thereafter. Jaffe very likely
detected a change in the Agents! attitude which accounts for

his statement that he felt his relationship with them had

cooled off,

There is no evidence contained in Jaffe's file that
either New York or Washington Field or the Bureau has ever taken
any action which would affect Jaffe's livelihood. Following
his return from Hong Kong, Jaffe told his handling Agents that
he was experiencing difficulty in finding a job. He several
times mentioned his concern that bis association with the FBI
might be the reason. On each oecasion, he was assurcd that
the FBI had never divulged his confidential relationship and
would not do so any time in the future.y

Jaffe's file does disclose that during an interview
with Washington Picld Agents in 1969, he said that he had
learned frcm a British Inceliigence contact in Hong Kong that
his recall £rom that city was caused by his refusal to coop-
crate with CIA, Ue also rel.ted that he later mentioned this
to a CIA contact in Washington who responded that the British

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC); INTERVIEW OF ASSTSTANT

DIRECTOR IN CHARGELROBERT E. GEBHARDT. SBY
SSC STAFF MEMBER .

On Au ugust. 7,1 1; 1975, “Assistant Director Robert E. E.
Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los
Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of
the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by
Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of the .
interview, that is, the Cointel Program of the FBI as it
related to the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party
when Gebhardt was the Special Agent in Charge of the San
Francisco Division from 1970 to 1972.

The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,
and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any
Bureau representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau
representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas
of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters
of interview.

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt
was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther
Party investigation on a day to day basis being specifically
advised details of the investigation as it relates to the
Cointel Program. It was explained to Seidel that as Special .
Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein
over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had
many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

therefore, relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment
| of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the

day to day direction of the various matters under investigation,
including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was
encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,
Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for
such consultation to resolve any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC
when the electronic coverage ‘of the Black Panther Party and
the various officials at BBP 'was instituted and eventually
terminated. Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage
was already in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival, however, he
does recall receiving a phone call after the "Keith Decision"
was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of
the BPP and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.
The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the
discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the
intelligence type investigations should be completely removed
from the criminal investigations which investigations would be
looking. toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal
investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence
information is obtained from time to time which really has no
value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible
value with respect to the direction of the investigation. In
some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence
7 information may be obtained and in other types, very little.
i . Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is
made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be
a basis for an investigation which procedures would include
matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

: In some instances, in such security investigations
a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained
therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-
gence type investigations should not be removed from or
differentiated from criminal type investigations looking
toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an
outgrowth of the basic investigation.

: Gebhardt was asked if he. felt the Cointelpro was a™
separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation
and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the
overall investigation in any particular organization or
individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact
legislation which would set forth specific investigative
techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or
other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in
Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted,
and in reply to the question as to-why such legislation should
not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative
agency, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexi-
bility because no two investigations are exactly alike and the
circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be
related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should
assure the American public that questionable activity such
as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative
agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress
and the American people must rely upon the integrity and
honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the
FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,
hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees
and finally approved by the Senate. It was further pointed
out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with
the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention
of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and
if circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could not
contemplate’. at this time, wherein it was thought such
activities should be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal
approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.
Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with
this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were
relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI
and Congress. He was informed that a Senate Oversight
Committee was recently established and it was felt that this
was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

~3- ce

DocId: 32989640 Page 244


standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular

’ inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as
to our activities. He was informed that there should be
either a joint oversight committee between the House and
Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees
in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the
entities through which all information relative to the
activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be
regular consultation between these representatives and the
FBI.

Inquiry was’ made as.to Gebhardt's opinion relative
to the relationship between the Department of Justice and
the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's
opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be
a free flow of information between the FBI and the Department
of Justice.

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed
up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely
set up a structured oversight procedure of the activities
of the FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many
of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure
itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will
maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters
usually referred to as national defense, national security
or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations
must be based on the application of the facts toward a

4 particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique
that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal
statute, consultation with the Department of Justice should
be had in ail instances.

an informal discussion and that information furnished by
Mr. Baker would be placed in a memorandum for the SSC.

the Socialist Workers Party (see.appendix), the Black Panther
Party, US, Incorporated (see appendix), the Nation of Islam
(see appendix), Espionage, Sabotage matters, and other investi-
gations were conducted on the squad supervised by him, which

field’ office level. He stated that as he recalled, a letter
| was submitted either monthly, quarterly or semi-annually.
| The letter was submitted by a Special Agent whose case load
was such that he could take the time to prepare the letter.

Mr. Baker replied that this was mot true but
that Special Agent Burns had been assigned the COINTELPRO
case because his case load was such that he was able to
handle the program.

Mr. Seidel inquired whether Special Agent Roy
Burns was transferred to the Butte Office of the FBI for
disciplinary reasons.

Mr. Baker replied that Special Agent Burns was
originally from Washington State and. had hiisearll to be trans~
ferred to that area.

Mr. Seidel asked if the Bureau aeatabed Agents
‘te participate in..disruptive,programs and then rewarded them...
inanciaily for their efforts.

Mr. Baker replied that the Bureau had an incentive
award program, and if an Agent did a good job in any field, he
could get recognition through an incentive award. ‘Mr. Baker
stated that he could not recall any award being given as a
result of COINTELPRO activity.

Mr. Seidel asked Mr. Baker if he could recall any
information concerning the Free Breakfast Program of the’ BPP.

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that’ the operation
of the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP was followed through
sources. They advised that some of the BPP officials were
stealing money from funds which were to be spent on the
breakfast program. The breakfast program was served at a
local Catholic church. Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that
an official of the Catholic church in San Diego was contacted
“regarding the priest in charge of the church where the break-
fast program was being held, who was reportedly an alcoholic.
Mr. Seidel was advised that the priest was transferred from
the church.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel asked what Mr. Baker's definition of
the COINTELPRO was.

Mr. Baker replied that the COINTELPRO was a
disruptive type program.

Mr. Seidel stated that the FBI had apparently
written a letter regarding a white girl friend of Kenneth
j Denman, a BPP leader in San Diego. He inquired as to why
this letter was written, : .

Mr. Baker stated that Denman was considered one
of the stronger leaders of the San Diego Branch of the BPP,
«and if-it was possible to keep him from becoming a strong
leadér, it would be disruptive to the party. The fact that
Denman was living with a “white giri~was considered derogatory :--
towacd him by BPP members in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether such activity.
would have been taken against a leader in an organization
such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
(see description) if the leader of such a group had been
living with a white woman. Would such a letter be appropriate?

Mr. Baker replied that he did not feel that such a
letter would be appropriate in this case because this organi-
zation involved a religious leader and our program was not
directed at religious groups but was directed toward black
militant and extremist groups. —

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker recalled
individuals in the BPP named Tate, Wallace, Denman and Bell.

Mr. Baker stated that he could not recall anything
specific about any of these individuals, except what he had
previously stated concerning Denman. He said he could recall
the names but nothing more concerning these individuals.

Mr. Seidel then mentioned an incident wherein the
San Diego Office of the FBI had furnished information to the
Los Angeles Office of the FBI for transmission to local auth-
orities concerning a group of BPP members from San Diego who
were traveling to Los Angeles to attend a funeral.

Mr. Baker stated that he could recall that such an
incident occurred and that information was furnished stating
that BPP members from San Diego would be carrying concealed
weapons. He said he thought the furnishing of this information
resulted in some of the BPP members being arrested in Los
Angeles.

-. Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker could

~ recall-someone from the-FBIein«San Diego visiting the

of a girl who was an alleged member of the BPP in San

and whether the FBI went to the-mother to put pressure on
another member of the family.

Mr. Baker stated that he vaguely recalled such a
case but could not recall the details and could not be
certain this had occurred.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether the FBI had any
technical surveillances on the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Baker stated that he knew of none and added that |
such coverage was not needed in San Diego because there were . i
good sources in the BPP who could furnish excellent coverage. :
Mr. Baker stated that he believes he would have known of any ;
such installations covering the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker knew of San Francisco

using any such techniques against the BPP.
“Mr. Baker replied that he believed that San Fran- d

cisco had used such techniques. :

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT

Mr. Seidel then asked why such techniques were
not used in San Diego if they were used in San Francisco.

Mr. Baker replied that such techniques were not
needed in San Diego due to the good source coverage of
party activity.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether there was a
conflict between US, Incorporated, and the BPP in San
Diego.

Mr. Baker replied that US, Incorporated, head-

quarters were in Los Angeles. There was a power struggle
‘Between che two groups for membership of blacks and much
“travel occurred by US, Incorporated, leaders fromvbos=: 7-7-4. -.- acrid

Angeles to San Diego and Mexico, and from San Diego to
Los Angeles. There were considerable conflict between the
two groups.

Mr. Seidel asked whether Mr. Baker recalled
Ron Karenga.

Mr. Baker replied that he did recall Ron Karenga

Mr. Seidel asked whether Mr. Baker recalled some
cards stating "Ron Karenga is impotent" which were printed
in Los Angeles and some of which might have been sent to
San Diego.

Mr. Baker replied that he does not recall these
ecards but this could have been correct.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker recalled some cartoons
being drawn concerning the BPP.

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that there were
two or three cartoons prepared depicting strife between US,
Incorporated, and the BPP. ~

Mr. Seidel then stated that these cartoons were

Mr. Baker stated that he did not recall.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that US, Incorporated,
and the BPP were led by and made up of people with extensive
criminal records, and because of this and their general
demeanor, the FBI did not really have to provoke or dis-
rupt them because they kept themselves in a constant state
of turmoil, He stated that Special Agents connected with
the COINTELPRO did not devote much time to the program be~
-cause of heavy case loads-.of. other matters. and. because. they...
“egsistad in working criminal matters such as ~bank “robberies -
and other criminal violations. Hypa EEEESESSERESOSEEE IE

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that a great. deal of muekad
time was spent by the Special Agents working with their :
sources because they had to be extremely careful that they ©
were protected. If a crime was planned and a sow ce had
knowledge of it, the source would try to keep the crime from
being committed. If it was not possible to prevent the crime,
the source might be forced to participate, and if arrested,a
- problem would becreated in attempting to get the source out
of jail and still conceal his identity as a source.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Mr. Baker as to the names of
the Agents he dealt with in Los Angeles and San Francisco in
connection with COINTELPRO,

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that Supervisor
Albert Clark had something to do with the program in San ‘
Francisco, and in Los Angeles he dealt with Supervisor Richard
Bloeser and Bill Knowland.

On _ July 31,1925, at 11:45 am. Mr. Lester Seidel:

of the United States Senate Select Committee (SSC) interviewed

SA Lawrence F. Wirick at the San Diego Office of the FBI.

No Advice of Rights was furnished SA Wirick and it was not
necessary for the interviewee to consult with an FBI representative.
The interview was terminated at 12:50 p.m. and as best recalled
included the following discussion in the form of questions and

You understand that this is an informal interview
and is in comnection with the Bureau's COINTELPRO
as it relates to the FBI investigation of the BPP?

Yes, but for what purpose is the Senate conducting
this survey?

To aid in formation of new legislation so that the
FBI and other Government agencies will have more
definite guidelines to follow.

I ‘believe the Congress already through lack of
information, isolated instances and some hysteria
have enacted too many restrictive laws that prevent
the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting
the law abiding element of our society from the

"bad guys".

(He was in general agreement) Did you_handle the
COINTELPRO from 1970 through March, 1971?

Yes, but I believe the BPP ceased to fimction locally
about November or December, 1970. As I recall my
function was to write a progress type letter regarding
progress which described the illegal activities of
members of the BPP and to report that this information

‘ had been furnished local police agencies but information

generally emanated from confidential informants,

Seidel:

Wirick:

What type of illegal activities and did your program
in any way instigate illegal activities on the part
of the BPP?

Criminal acts committed by local members of the BPP

is what I was referring to. I don't believe it was
ever necessary to instigate any illegal acts or in

any way entrap BPP members in criminal acts. The
majority of local BPP members were thieves, narcotics
addicts, lazy, unemployed and were hero worshipers of
the BPP in Oakland, California. They wanted to emulate
the Oakland organization, but their own dishonesty,

et cetera, was a constant source of turmoil amongst
the local group.

I recall, date unknown, information was received
regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denmon), one time
head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit
cards,

Information was received that Walter Wallace

(Walter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that
he and his wife, Velma, were stealing to get money

for narcotics and that Velma's mother was also involved
in local thefts.

All above information was furnished local law agencies
and local arrests were made. Furnishing the

above type of information is a function and responsibility
of the FBI.

The BPP in-San Diego was very effective in causing

criminal activities were not restricted to the examples
I've given.

Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast
Program?

No, not to my knowledge, I recall that soon after -
the Breakfast Program was started that other members
of the BPP accused Ken Denmon of stealing money from
contributions made to the Program.

On second thought I believe we did disrupt the BPP
Breakfast Program in that we received complaints

from several daizys and bread companies, et cetera,

that they had been approached by BPP members with
veiled threats of extortion if they did not donate
quantities of food et cetera to the BPP Breakfast
Program. The FBI and local police investigated and

I believe as a result their practices were discontinued,
but the investigation failed to establish a prosecutable
offense of extortion.

Did you have any connection with distribution of

No, but I have seen “cartoons” in the BPP newspaper.

They featured "cartoons" showing the "pigs" (police)

seeing some "cartoons" showing how the BPP would kill
the “honkies" (white people). They were similar to
the propaganda leaflets used by the Nazis against
American troops before an attack. The articles in the
BPP newspaper were even more foul.

Did the COINTELPRO promote dissension between the BPP
and the US Group (see Appendix page)?

Not to my knowledge. As I recall there was never

any need to. They were constantly at odds with each
other and on a gang type basis were trying to eliminate
each other. i believe Sylvester Bell, a San Diego BPP
member was killed by an US Group member and John Savage,
another local BPP member was killed by an US Group
member,

In Los Angeles two other BPP members, names not ’
recalled, were allegedly killed by US Group members.

I believe this led to the popular saying in Southeast
San Diego section where most blacks live that the score |
(game) was, "US 4 - BPP 0", : :

After thought, no. Because the paper itself was

so vile and anti-white that the odor would never

stop BPP members from reading same. I've always
hoped that a large segment of the population,
especially the "do-gooders" could or would experience
the nauseous reaction I have felt after reading the
illiterate, foul-mouthed, anti-white, anti-Government,
BPP paper. I think everybody should read a copy of
the BPP paper so that they will know the type and
character of BPP members.

What do you think about anonymous letters sent to
spouses of BPP members saying the husband was sleeping
with a white girl, et cetera?

Most wives of the members I recall were also BPP
members and/or common-law-wives. Many BPP members

did have liaison with white girls but I doubt if

such 2 letter would bother most spouses of BPP members.
However, such a letter might be of value under certain
circumstances, example: the stories that were spread
during World War II which were not necessarily all true
regarding Hitler, Mussolini, General Patton and others.

In your opinion was the COINTELPRO of any value?
Should it be changed? Do you have any suggestions
for changes, or should it be eliminated completely?

Yes, as I recall, it acted as a progress letter of the
BPP, its direction, its dissension, its change in
leadership, and indications ‘of its slow local demise
because of the character of the local BPP members, and

‘as a summary of its activities for FBIHQ. I recall that

(SA) LAWRENCE F, ‘ERICK BY “
SSC STAFF MEMBER

we made certain requests to conduct some types
of counterintelligence against the BPP, but I
do not recall that the Bureau ever authorized any
counterintelligence act which might be productive.

Change? GOINTELPRO is not being utilized to the
best of my knowledge and has not been for some time.

I believe that in about two or three years Congress
will be frantically asking the FBI why we did not
furnish them intelligence, advance knowledge of a
demonstration, a riot and other civil unrest and
elimination of the COINTELPRO has been another step
in the direction of placing the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies in a position where we cannot
react to the activities of groups such as the BPP
which have been formed with the main purpose

of overthrowing the United States.

tion. He was not consulted during the interview.

Prior to the interview, SA Petersen had been
advised by San Diego FBI officials that FBI Headquarters
had waived the employee agreement not to furnish informa-
tion for the purpose of this interview. ‘He was advised
that he had a right to counsel but that the FBI was unable
to provide private counsel for him. aoe

SA Petersen was advised that he would not be
required to answer questions that might divulge the identity
of any FBI source; that would reveal information relative to
sensitive methods and techniques; or information which
originated with other agencies, including foreign intelligence
agencies. :

SA Petersen was advised that the interview was to
involve only the COINTELPRO as it applied to the Black Panther
Party (BPP) (see appendix).

This document contains neither recommendations nor conciusions if
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to

PETERSEN

How long have you been in

the Bureau?

Twenty-four years as of
June 25, 1975.

Where have you been. assigned?

In Boston, Baltimore, New
York, Tampa, and San Diego.

The Bureau has indicated that’
you were a coordinator of the
COINTELPRO in San Diego. As
such, what were your duties?

The duties for the most part
consisted cf preparing letters
te the Bureau asking for ~ :
authority to take some specific
action in the program; awaiting
the reply from the Bureau; and
then, if any action was taken,
to advise the Bureau of the
results of such action. It

is noted that many of the re-
quests to take specific action
were turned down by the Bureau. -

Were you the focal point of
the program?

Yes, in.the sense that any

idea for action te be taken

in the program was trans-~

mitted to the Bureau for
approval by me and if approval
was received, it would be re-
lated to whomever had suggested
the activity. I would then
report any results to the Bureau.

Mr. Seidel: Did you get heavy pressure from
: Bureau officials to take action
in this program?

SA Petersen: ’ Not any more than any other
. case, and I had a number of
other cases assigned to me
at the time the COINTELPRO
was assigned to me.

Mr. Seidel: aoe eg type of things did you
iO 7 i"
SA Petersen: I do not recall at this time

any specific action taken in
the program. I do recali that
a Black Panther leader, Walter
Wallace, was removed as leader
of the party in San Diego. I
believe it was suspected that
he might have cooperated with
the FBI. This could have been

/ accomplished by interviewing
him where the interview could
be seen by other party members.
If the Agents shook his hand,
smiled, and acted like he was
a friend, it might plant the
seed of suspicion in the minds
of other BPP members, I do
not recall specifically whether
this happened but at any rate,
Wallace was not trusted and
was removed as leader of the
party.

Mr. Seidel: Could such a thing get Wallace
killed or injured?

INTERVIEW OF SA EARL M. PETERSEN
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

SA Petersen: I do not see how it would
because there would be no way
anyone could determine whether

| a or not Wallace was, in fact,

. cooperating with the FBI. He
was probably removed by the

BPP as a precautionary measure.

I cannot recall whether or

not Wallace was removed while

I was coordinator of the program.

Mr. Seidel: Was COINTELPRO successful?

SA Petersen: I was not too impressed with
its success in San Diego while
I had it assigned to me be-
cause it was a new program
and it took some time to get
it established and working.
Most of the success was probably
due to information obtained

. xegarding criminal violations,
mostly local in nature, which
was furnished to local law
enforcement officers, causing
the arrest of BPP members. -
This would have been done
whether or not we had a
COINTELPRO. It was necessary
to prepare a letter to the
Bureau asking authority to
take action and then wait
for a reply authorizing the
activity. Many times suggested
COINTELPRO activity suggestions
would be turned down.

INTERVIEW OF SA EARL M. PETERSEN
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel made available Xerox copies of Bureau
letters captioned, "Counter-Intelligence Program; Black
Nationalist - Hate Groups," dated August 25, 1967 and
March-4, 1968. These were read by SA Petersen, who said he
could not specifically recall reading the letters.

Mr. Seidel: Was contact with the police
formal or informal?

SA Petersen: Contact was personal or telephonic

contact and at one time, informa-
tion furnished to individual officers
was confirmed by letter to the

Chef of Police. It is not re-
called if this was the policy

- during the time COINTELPRO was
assigned to me.

Mr. Seidel: What happened to SA Roy Burns?

SA Petersen: He was transferred to the Butte,
Montana Field Office.

Mr. Seidel: — Did he do anything wrong? I
understand Agents were sometimes
transferred to Butte as a disci-
plinary measure.

SA Petersen: SA Burns wanted to be transferred
to Butte and requested the trans-~
fer. The Special Agent in Charge
(SAC), Mr. Evans, was transferred
there and may have helped SA
Burns get moved there. :

Mr. Seidel: How old is Bob Baker:

SA Petersen: Probably 51 or 52 years old. .

Did he retire early?

No. He was in a position to

retire and retired because he
wanted to take advantage of a

cost of living increase by retiring
prior to a certain date, such as
June 30.

Were the BPP and US, Inc. both
violence oriented groups?

Very definitely. There was extreme
friction between the BPP and US,
Inc. at all times.

Do you reéall some caricatures
used in connection with COINTELPRO?

Yes.

Who had the program at that time?
I believe SA Burns had it then.
What were the cartoons?

I recall seeing them but do not
recall any specific cartoon.

Do you think anything done in
COINTELPRO could have had a
reaction causing someone to kill
an individual in the other group?

Because of the extreme antagonism
between the two groups, anything

we did would have had about the
same effect as a gnat biting an
elephant. I do not think COINTELPRO
~had that kind of impact.

Did you ever supervise any techni-
cal installation or electronic
surveillance of the BPP in San
Diego?

No. I don't recall anything | like

_ that being done here.

How would you feel about writing
a letter to a wife saying her
husband was sleeping with various.
other women if the husband was a
BPP leader?

I would hesitate to do this
because it might break up a
family. If the facts were true
and this might cause the BPP
leader to be less effective, it
would probably be a good counter=
intelligence move.

I am referring to Page 91 of a
BPP COINTELPRO summary which

indicates that a BPP leader was
living with a white girl and an
anonymous letter was written to

others in the BPP saying that this ~

individual was living with a white
girl. Do you recall anything about
that? :

I believe that leader could have
been Kenneth Denmon in San Diego.
I recall that he was living with
a white woman and that others in
the BPP were made aware of this
in some mianner. The BPP in San

Diego was teaching children to
hate and kill police officers.
They planned violent criminal
acts and were making plans to
take over the established govern-
Ment at the first opportunity.

If a leader of such a group could
be discredited and removed, it
would help to keep the group from
becoming stronger, as they would |
have to select a new leader, and
he would have to get the group
reorganized. Denmon had many
additional weaknesses which could
be used in a counter~intelligence
programe

Do you recall a letter being sent
to BPP Headquarters saying a
leader of the BPP was cooperating
with the police in Los Angeles?

I do not recall such a letter.

Do you recall some cards being
sent to San Diego from Los Angeles
saying, "Ron Karenga is impotent"?

No, I do not recall such cards,
Ron Karenga was a leader cf US,
Inc., not the BPP.

Do yor recall that cartoons were
to be sent to BPP members to dis-
credit the leaders?

I recall the cartoons but do not
recall whether they were set to
BPP members. i

Do you recall an anonymous letter
being sent to the Catholic Church
to have the priest of the church
where the BPP breakfast program
was operated removed from his
office?

I do not recall such an anonymous
letter; however, I do recall that
the priest was transferred by
the church.

Knowing that the BPP paper was

a paper that taught and advocated
violence and had cartoons in it
that encouraged the killing of
police officers by blacks and

was a violence oriented paper,
how would you feel about putting
a corrosive liquid on the paper
to keep it from being distributed?

I would not do it as I would feel

FROM Ciwkkector, FEL

SUBJECT: PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILES

in response to your memorandum dated July 18, 1975,
captioned as above, we observe that the "substantial negotiations"
which produced the proposed procedures did not include participation
by a representative of the FBI and that the request for our views
concerning disclosure of highly sensitive FBI material was first
réceived at 11:14 a.m. today with a reply expected by 2:00 p.m.
today. We respectfully suggest that not only should you afford greater
apportunity for an expression of our views on this matter, but that
any such proposed procedures should be presented to the President's
Counsel for concurrence and for an expression of the President's views
as to the general policy of the Executive Branch in this regard. Further,
you may want to consider addressing the problem of the impact such
general disclosure of files would have on pending criminal investigations.

A preliminary review in the time available revealed that
certain items require considerable modification. For example, Item (Xe)
should be reconsidered with the following language:

"An exception to (2) and (b) above is made for information
that would tend to identify sources to whom the FBI has

an obligation of confidentiality as to which no access

will be furnished unless the identity already has been made
known to the Committee, or unless the Attorney General,
the Chairman and the Vice Chairman jointly agree on the
limited disclosure of such identity to the Chairman and the
Vice Chairman."

‘Ae, PBL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Item (6)(b) should be reconsidered with the following language:

‘Tf the Task Force Leader has any objections to the
excisions or paraphrases, the F Bi will furnish a
written statement of the grounds for its position to
the Special Counsel who shali resolve the matter by
negotiation within 24 hours.’

Item (8) should be reconsidered with the following language:

"The Staff and the Members of the Committee may examine
the original materials to which the Staff is given access

as extensively as necessary between the hours of 8:00 a.m.
and 5:30 p.m,, Monday through Friday, in the FBI J. Edgar
Hoover Building at Room 4171."

in light of the difficulties described, itis my strong
recommendation that such procedures should not be hastily agreed upon
with the Committee and that full discussion should be had concerning this
matter by representatives of the FRI, the Attorney General, the Commitiee
and the Counsel to the President.

COMMENTS ON PROPOSED PROCEDURES

48 hour lead time is very short and may create problems; 24 hour
reaction time may be unreasonable for Attorney General.

The provision seems a little odd, out of context of negotiations.
Suggest that in 3(a), last line, word and should be or and

"peculiarly sensitive” read to modify both foreign intelligence
sources and ongoing operations.

Time frames are very restrictive; there should be a stated

With the exception of the Solicitor General's Office, all

OLC, OLA, and Criminal Division favor a combination of

COMMENTS ON PERSONAL FILES

Suggest combine option 1 and option 3; make deletion per option 1,
but make oral explanation of the deletion; entire paragraph or ie
document should be withheld to protect source. i

Feels there is a serious, if not constitutional, issue as to the
prospective trespass upon a citizen's rights to give infornation
in confidence to his government.

Option 4 is absolutely unacceptable; would fight it in the courts.

SUBJECT: July 18 memo-~congressional access to

personal files maintained by the FBI

Without kiowing how these files were compiled (public
sources? wiretap? confidential informant?), or what

is in them (personal matter of derogatory nature?
national security information?), or why they exist,

(I have read in newspapers that they exist, but that's
all), I would probably choose in the absence of knowing
something about these Option #1, with the understanding
that Gopies of ceéleaséuble iufvrmaiiou can then be
made available to the Senator according to criteria. |
speiled out in the Freedom of Information Act, I
assume, however, that whoever is advising the AG

about this has actually read the files in question,

at least sufficient to know in a generic sense the
answers to the questions raised above.

Despite the fact that I am operating in a vacuum on
this, I do appreciate being consulted.

“K, William O'Connor, Esq.
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination

Office of the Deputy Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice :
Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. O'Connor: :

: I have received your letter of July 15 regarding
access/delivery of documents requested in the Committee's
letter of July 9, 1975. The following relates specifically
to the procedure suggested for handling documents on the
so called “Kissinger 17" surveillance, which is also applied
in your letter to materials relating to electronic sur-
veillance of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic
City in August 1964, materials relating to the electronic

aid poonibly ihe G & C Liles.

Lllonce sft Re
Zllance of Dr. King,

I regard this suggested procedure as a major step
forward and a recognition that previous arrangements were
too cumbersome and time-consuming. Nevertheless, there
“are certain practical problems with the procedure which may
be resolved by interpretation. For example, I assume that
application of the procedure to the Atlantic City conven~
tion matters does not foreclose the Committee from receiving
for use at its offices actual documents or portions of
documents, as well as summaries. I understand that the
FBI has no objection to providing such documents on this
matter to the Committee for use at its offices. it

Therefore, in order that the procedure you suggest
may be applicable to ail areas of Committee inquiry claimed
by the Department to involve particularly sensitive matters,
it should be interpreted as follows: the Committee staff

will have direct access to all files and materials at FBIHQ:

the Committee starr shall sélect certain documents from the
files which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiry

. and necessary for the examination of witnesses or the es-
tablishment of certain facts during the course of the

inquiry; the FBI shall at that time designate specific
portions of such documents which might jeopardize par-
ticularly sensitive sources or methods; with respect

to such specifically designated portions of documents,
the Committee staff will prepare appropriate excisions
or summaries of the information; the summaries will be
checked at that time with senior Bureau executives to

- ensure the protection of particularly sensitive FBI

sources or methods; thereafter, the excised documents
and summaries will be removed to the Committee's offices;
the Committee staff may check back to the original documents
as extensively as necessary; staff notes on the designated
specific portions of documents: will not be removed from
FBIHQ; and Committee members may, of course, at.any time a
see the documents which the staff has seen.

I believe this interpretation can serve as a work-
‘fable framework for Committee access to particularly sensitive
FBI materials. You may be assured that the Task Force shares
your concern for the need to provide special handling tech-
nigues to convey or secure any particularly sensitive
information or materials, as indicated in the Outline for
Inquiry Procedures. we hope this interpretation will
‘facilitate the mutual effort by the Committee and the
Department of Justice to accomplish this purpose.

I would appreciate receiving your immediate advice

“to me as to whether any further interpretation of this

matter is required. Any public discussion of these arrange-
ments and interpretations should be cast in such terms as

“will not jeopardize particularly sensitive FBI sources.

Sincerely,

the so called "Kissinger 17" surveillence will be made available to
you and specific appropriately cleared staff in Room 4171 of the
Hoover Building. These docurents may be revicwed and studied there,
and you and such staff may take such notes as you deem appropriate;
we have agreed that the notes are to be left in the secure room of
the Hoover Building during your study, When your study is completed,
you may prepare a summary of the information which you consider to be
appropriate for Committee use. The summary must be checked with
senior Bureau executives to ensure the protection of national security
matters, pretection of confidential sources of information, and
observation of privacy considerations. Thereafter, the approved
summary may be removed to the Committee's office and all the staff
notes will be destroyed. You may check the summary back to the
original documents as extensively as necessary, in Room 4171.

Page 3, Paragraph 2, Subsecticn B. Materials have already
been transmitted regarding the Kraft matter and the agreement between
his attorey and the Attomey General. When you have reviewed those
materials, and have contacted Mr. Kraft's attorney, should you deem
‘that appropriate, I understand you will contact me if further infor-
mation is requested. :

Page 5, Paw yh 3, A&B. As you may know, representatives
of the Yang fanily, Including Me. Harry H. Wachtel, attorney, have
formally expressed to the Department a special concern regarding any
public disclosure cf any derogatory information regerding Dr. King
which may-be contained in Bureau files. Subject to your reaching
an agreement with such representatives of ‘the King family, and the
acceptance by the Department of such a written agreement, all of the
materials related to the electronic surveillance of Dr. King, in the
custody of the FBI, will be made available to you and specific appro-
priately cleared staff under the same conditions and with the same
agreements as specified above with regard to the "Kissinger 17"
surveillance.

Page 6, Paragraph 4. ‘Those materials in the custody of the
- FBI which reflect and relate to electronic surveillance of the
Democratic Nationel Convention in Atlantic City in August 1964,
will be provided under the same conditions as articulated above
with regard to the "Kissinger 17" surveillance.

Page 9, Paragraph C. A summary of procedures for mail covers
has been provided by my recent letter to you. In addition to that,
a statistiest summary of mail covers on closed matters will be made
available to you in Room 4171, together with access to the underlying
documentation requesting the individual mail covers.

Docurentation relating to the opening of mail will be withheld
at present, due to ongoing investigations.

After your review of the mail cover summaries and any under-
7 . jying documents you wish to review, we will discuss any further access
which you may request to mail cover information.

Hy Page 10, Paragraph E. I understand and accept your explanation

{ that the word “implementation” in line 2 of paragraph E(1), does not

i seek access to the "raw" files of COINTELPRO programs. All of the
memoranda originating the several COINTELPRO programs will be made

available to you and specific appropriately cleared staff for review

| in Room 4171.

|

We will furnish to you, fer your study at Senate Select.
Committee offices, a complete set of the excised exhibits A-E to
the Petersen Report; as previously agreed, your staff may have
access to any unexcised pages of Exhibits A-E which you may wish to
see, and which will be maintained at Room 4171. The back up materials
underlying eny particular summary in A-E will be extracted from the
"yess" files upon your request ‘and made available to you for your
study in Room 4171. , General access to the "raw" files is not
Hl required, as I understand it, for your purposes under this agreement.
t General disclosure of information derived from documents other than
the excised pages of Exhibits A-E will be made available subject to
limitations to be determined, dependent upon the sens: Z
information, in conference “with appropriate Bureau officials and in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph B of the Outline for
Inquiry Procedures, to protect the considerations outlined above.

. Page 14, Item I. This will oonfina your understanding that

: certain Huston Plan documents prepared by the Bureau in xesponse to
your request under this heading have been delivered to the White

House for "third agency clearance”. This statement formally confirms
my previous discussions with you of this fact when we met with

Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers on July 2. Be advised that the docu-
ments which have been transmitted to the White House for clearance
will be forwarded to you, or made available for access, if appropriate,
upon our receipt of the White House directions.

' Page 16, Paragraph J. This will confirm our understanding that
on July 14, there will be available for your review in Room 4171, a
160 page summary document reflecting an analysis of the 0 & C files.

{ After you have reviewed that analysis, I will discuss with you
jeeRneeeal an appropriate further step with regard to the 0 & C files if such is
indicated; such an agreement would be generally similar in terms to
the foregoing arrangements. a

I trust that this letter accurately reflects our understanding
as reached in our discussion on July 11. If it does not, your inme~
diate advice to me of any particulars in which we disagree in our
understanding will be appreciated. In the meantime, I have furnished
a copy of this letter to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney
General and have requested the Bureau's cooperation in promptly making
available the information indicated.

I would appreciate meeting with you and Mr. Schwarz and
Mr. Smothers around July 18, for the purpose of discussing any
problems which you may have identified and to clarify any out-
stending documentary request which you may have, and to agree upon
an appropriate schedule. Since we have received several additional
requests from you, since the July 9, letter was delivered, it would
seem appropriate to re-analyze your requirements in light of the
agreements reached on July 11, reflected herein.

Sincerely, .

Washington, D.C. (? iy

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

a
On behalf of the Select Committee, we wish to

express our appreciation to you for meeting with us on *
= Wednesday afternoon. We recognize the need for the Com- i

mittee to have a complete understanding of the concerns

of the Department of Justice so that our inquiry can —

proceed in the most responsible manner. Our meeting

was extremely valuable in that respect, and you may be

sure that we have given full consideration to your

views

The Committee has been informed that Mr. John
T. Elliff, leader of the Domestic Intelligence Task
Force, and members of his staff met yesterday with Mr.
K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intellizance
coordination, and members of his staff to agree upon t
procedures for delivery of and access to FBI materials
requested by the Committee. The proposed‘ procedures
which resulted from that meeting are sishneiaibnisiaitd to
the Committee.

We are pleased that your staff was able to meet
promptly with our representatives and that they reached
7 agreement without delay. The Committee expects that the
| proposed Leaaeaapaeal will, if implemented, expedite its
| work during the coming weeks. As you know, one of our
major concerns was that all of the problems with the
Committee's outstanding requests for materials

be resolved before the August recess so that the staff
can fully prepare the materials for our use when we
return. We believe the procedures are an appropriate
and practical accommodation of our mutual interests.
Indeed, we have instructed our staff to make every effort
to accomplish the work of the Committee within this
framework.

The prompt resolution of this matter demon-
strates a spirit of cooperation which we hope will
prevail in all our future relations. The Committee Looks
forward to working with you personally on issues of common
concern during the months ahead.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
“INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

: BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 5, 1975, Gupervisor Richard H: Bloeser

was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel at the
Los Angeles FBI Office regarding the COINTELPRO/Black Panther
Party (BPP).

Mr. Seidel advised Supervisor Bloeser that the
interview was voluntary, but did not advise Supervisor
Bloeser of his rights in this matter.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Supervisor Bloeser as to
how many offices‘he had served in, his length of service in
the Bureau, and how long had been spent on intelligence
investigations. Supervisor Bloeser replied that he had
served in Philadelphia, El Paso and Los Angeles, had been
_in the Bureau approximately 24%~years, and had been assigned
to intelligence work for 22 years.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Supervisor Bloeser

believed that the Bureau had placed undue pressure on the
field to come up with counter intelligence proposals concerning
the BPP and was it difficult to come up with a proposal.

7 Supervisor. Bloeser responded that there was no undue pressuré

~ “placed on the field by the Bureau, that the COINTELPRO/BPP
-was merely another case assigned to an agent and that agent,
as in any other case, had the responsibility of handling the
matter whether it concemed the solving of a case or the
submission of proposals. Mr. Seidel was also informed: that
it was not: unduly difficult to come up with a proposal and that
a number of proposals were rejected at the field level and.
never submitted to the Bureau.

: Mr. Seidel inquired specifically as to counter
intelligence proposals involving .cartoons ridiculing the BPP.

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely remembered such
proposals but without reviewing the file had no definite
recollection. Mr. Seidel did not request that the file be
reviewed. : 7

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically about a business
card which allegedly had been prepared by the Bureau bearing
the phrase "Karenga is impotent. “ Mr. Seidel requested
Supervisor Bloeser's views on the distribution of this card
by the FBI. Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely
remembered the card, that he thought it was humorous, and
that the word impotent had various meanings. °

Mr. Seidel then inquired about the blood feud
which existed in the past between the US Organization and
the BPP and the efforts of the Bureau to keep this feud.
alive. and thus promote violence. Hé specifically inquired
as to the personal feelings of Supervisor Bloeser concerning’
€@ny counter intelligence proposals which, if placed in
operation, could lead to violence between the two groups.

Supervisor Bloeser responded, first that. personally’
he had no apologies for the counter intelligence program as
‘a whole, that proposals submitted six or seven years ago's. -
were believed necessary at that time.due to the circumstan
specifically that at that time the EPI and the US Organizati
were involved in violent activity against the community as a
whole. Mr. Seidel was informed that the feud between the US
Organization and the BPP occurred long before the FBI
COINTELPRO became involvéd.in the feud and that any proposals
: approved by the Bureau had relatively :little effect on the

violence committed by either -group. ‘Mr. Seidel was also
reminded that six or seven years ago the Congress of the
- United States fully supported the war in Vietnam in which
thousands of people were killed: but that under todays
circumstances no support has been given to South Vietnam.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE -ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then posed a hypothetical question
involving the following factors: Would Supervisor Bloeser
now or in the past approve a counter intelligence proposal
whereby one extremist with a criminal record of violence
be anonymously informed that another extremist with a
record of criminal violence-was an informant for the FBI,-
knowing that the alleged informant might be injured or
killed. Supervisor Bloeser replied that under the present
conditions such a proposal would not be approved, but
that he could not give an answer as to what his feelings
might have been six or seven years ago under any given
situation. Mr. Seidel was again reminded that Congress
in the past has not hesitated to-support wars which kill
thousands of people but that recently they have critiszedcixed
the CIA for allegedly plotting to assassinate one individual
whose death might prevent a war. Mr. Seidel was also informed
that it was ironic that. Congress was investigating another
agency of the Federal Government which was attempting to
prevent revolutionary violence in this country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired into the counter
intelligence proposals approved by the Bureau in relation
to the actress Jean Seberg and Raymond Hewitt, a leader
of the BPP. This proposal concerned the fact that Seberg,
who was then married to a.French producer, admitted. being
pregnant-by Hewitt who was. absormaryiéd at the time...The ‘a
Bureau approved anonymously Baking: ‘this: information:to a
Hollywood columnist. Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether
Supervisor Bloeser did or did not believe that this was an
invasion of privacy. Supervisor Bloeser responded that the
item was news_worthy and that it would have been any.faix game
for any newsmen had they Gome across it in the course of “their

* business which they could: have: probably easily done, and that

certainly Congress would not have critised & newspaper for
printing such an item or claim it to be an Hvasion of privacy.
Mr. Seidel inquired as to the purpose of this particular
operation and he was informed that Miss Seberg was giving
support .to the BPP and that it was hoped that such publicity

He was further advised that it was the responsibility of the
FBI to determine who was ainacintiad revolutionary groups in this
wountry. :

Mr. Seidel then inquired as to whether or not it
was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under
present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure.
He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an
effective intelligence operation under present circumstances
and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be
helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its
investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field. Mr. Seidel
inquired as to whether it would be helpful to have specific
legislation which might completely separate criminal and
hhtelligence operations so one would not taint the other.

He was informed that if such legislation could be enacted
that it would undoubtedly help the FBI.

The interview lasted approximately two hours and
it was not necessary to consult with another Bureau
representative during this time.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA WALLACE E. WARD

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 5, 1975, Special Agent Ga) Wallace E.
FER was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel at
os Angeles Field Office regarding Cointelpro/Black

Panther Party. The interview lasted from 9:12 a.m, to
9:22 a.m.

SA Ward was advised by Mr. Seidel that the
interview was voluntary but SA Ward was not advised of
his rights in this matter.

Seidel asked how long SA Ward had been a

Special Agent with the FBI, and SA Ward responded nine
years. He further requested previous offices SA Ward
had been assigned to, and SA Ward responded Cincinnati,
Ohio. Seidel advised the Bureau informed him that SA
Ward had been assigned Cointelpro/Black Panther Party
in June 1969. Seidel requested to know what work SA
Ward had been assigned before this, to which SA Ward
-cesponded he could not remember, but believed general
criminal work,

Seidel requested to know what specific
instructions were issued with regard to operating
Cointelpro/Black Panther Party. SA Ward advised
that due to his employment agreement, the sensitive
nature of the Bureau work, and the possible overlap
of Bureau investigation, he did not feel he could
respond to any further questions. Seidel advised he
understood SA Ward's position as he, Seidel, had
worked criminal matters himself and knew the need
for secrecy. The official interview was terminated
at this point,

“. @ e@

In a friendly conversation that followed
for approximately ten to fifteen minutes, SA Ward
advised Seidel that he had only been assigned the
Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter for three
months and had no knowledge that would be of value
to Seidel. The Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter
was not further discussed. The rest of the time was
involved in discussing points of interest in the Los
Angeles basin of tourist value, such as Marineland,
Palos Verdes, and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.

SA Ward advises that he is aware that the
Director waived his employment agreement with certain
exceptions regarding privileged areas. With this in
mind, SA Ward reviewed his employment agreement and
concluded, after noting the following quotation, that
he could not disclose any information without following
the prescribed procedure: i

"The burden is on me to determine, prior to
disclosure, whether information may be disclosed, and
in this regard, I agree to request approval of the
Director of the FBI in each such instance by presenting
the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior
to disclosure",

With this in mind, SA Ward answered Mr.
Seidel as noted heretofore. :

This document contains neither recommendations
nor conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the
FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and its contents
are not to be distributed outside your agency.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

i I am writing to call your attention to a mat-
ter which may be a cause of concern to you and to the
Select Committee at some time in the future.

As von mav know, a svecial unit has been estab~
Baoudd da Ue PDE Tntelligence 5 Di
Committee's requests for materials and to handle certain
arrangements for the Committee staff's interviews. The
Special Agents assigned to this unit accompany Bureau
witnesses to the Committee offices, travel to out-of-town
locations where Committee staff interviews are conducted,
and apparently “de-brief" interview subjects after the
j. interviews.

One possible problem has arisen with this arrange-
ment. As you are aware, one of the alleged abuses which
the Committee is examining pursuant to S. Res. 21 involves
the FBI's activities with respect to the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. As the inquiry has proceeded, informa-
tion has been developed to indicate that one of the
Special Agents who has been handling Committee staff inter-
views, "de-briefing" witnesses, and, presumably, compiling
materials with respect to the King matter was also the
supervisory case agent during the time that some of the
alleged FBI improprieties regarding Dr. King took place.
__Moreover, as a logical step in our investigation, it was

recently necessary to interview this Spxcial Agent to
determine the nature and extent of his involvement in and
knowledge of the alleged abuses at the time when he served
as supervisory case agent with respect do the King case.
During the interview he did provide detailed information
concerning his substantial participation in this matter.

The Committee in no way intents at this juncture
to pre-judge the propriety of the FBI's activities with
respect to Dr. King, and it would be inzppropriate to
characterize the conduct of any of the Rrreau's personnel
regarding this case until all the factsare in. Neverthe-
less, I am concerned that in this kind of situation, the
interests of the FBI and the Department of Justice might
best be served, from the standpoint of @pearances, by re-
considering the assignment of this Speciial Agent to the
King matters. It is possible that some may conclude that .
there is a conflict between the Special Agent's personal
Escchisbanbie and the Sashiacechoa of the FBI ad the Justice

Adoslomen ta the Greet

tee is made with | espece to this case.,

Finally, let me assure you thai the Committee
has no evidence that the present arrangenent has prevented
the Committee from obtaining the full disclosures sought;
| but it seems to me that it would be mutwlly beneficial
| for appropriate steps to be taken so thai we will both be

able to assure the American people and die Congress that
our oversight responsibilities were fulfilled in an objec-
tive and impartial way.

I hope you will share my view that this course
will best serve our respective interests and, of course,
the interests of the country.

Honorable Frank Church

Aa to the availability of an ¥F &8f representative during
Commitiee staff interviews of present or former F Bf employees
concerning alleged “abuses, "1 have determined that such no longer
will be generally afforded. ‘The subject matters requiring consultation
with such witnesses are essentially four: (1) information which identifies
or way identify FE confidential sources; (2) information which may
adversely affect on-going FEL investigations; (3) information concerning
sensitive methods and techniques; and (4) information obtained from
third agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Witnesses may
be cautioned prior to interview concerning such problem areas and
refrain from furnishing the information pending consultation with FEI
Headquarters. This modification is effective immediately,

| I hope that you will bring this matter to the attention of
i your staff and that in so doing you also will review the standards of

objectivity and impartiality being followed in their interviews to assure
protection of individual rights.

Sincerely yours,

Clarence M. Meliey

Honorable Edward H. Levi
Attorney General

U. S. Department of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General: 7
3 :
I would like to bring to your personal attention
a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to
establish the relevant facts with respect to one.of the
areas of alleged abuse which is ieee subject of inquiry
pursuant to S. Res. 21.

I have been informed by the staff that numerous
Materials which have been requested during the past several
weeks which pertain to the FBI's activities with respect to
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., have been withheld from the
Committee by the Department because of concern expressed
by Mr. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and
estate, as to the appropriateness of the Department's
"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King.

Upon reviewing the lists of materials requested,
I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could
conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,
especially in view of the fact that our letters of request
y have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-
.cripts should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to
place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all of
the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King
matters, with the limited exception of (1) Mr. DeLoach's
August 24 - 27, 1964 memoranda which pertain to the 1964
Democratic National Convention, and (2) those portions of any
other requested materials which actually summarize or quote
from conversations monitored during any electronic surveill-

ance of Dr. Ring. ‘m fi PeiaTION CONTAINED

Delivery is requested by Wednesday, September 3,
1975, pursuant to the provisions of the general procedural
agreement between the Department and the Committee which
governs all Committee requests. I understand that the
Bureau has been collecting the King-related materials upon .
receipt of each of our requests, and therefore I presume
that there will be no substantial burden in meeting the
September 3 date. .

Your cooperation is appreciated.

I am taking the liberty of sending Mr. Wachtel
a copy of this request.
