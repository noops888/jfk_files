on either side, and it has no street or alley behind it.

Customarily,

the back yard is clearly illuminated at night by several permanent

spot lights.

GABRIEL MANNARINO, his wife, JEAN, and their two

teenage daughters occupy the house.

As the Bureau has been notified previously, GABRIEL MANNARINO' g

cottage on Old Leechburg Road, In Allegheny Township, Westmoreland

county, fa., Is a one-story, frame bullding, which sits back

about 300 feet from the road on a l0 acre tract which stopes

from front to rear. It has a small lake in front of 1t, and

it is surrounded by wooded area.

It has 3 bedrooms, a

kitche, a living-dining room, and a screened porch:

To the

right rear and about 20 feet from the house is a wire pen, which

holds three German Sheperd dogs.

PCI HERBERT L. RAY, Who

lives nearby, says there are no private telephone lines 1n

the area, and 1t

1s known that the cottage has no telephone.

From past experience, It is known that GABRIEL MANNARINO almost

never has visitors at his home, especially those having

any connections with racket activities, poiltics, or

enforcement.

SAMUEL MANNARINO occasionally has vialtors of

the above types, but the visits are so infrequent and unpredictable,

that it does not seem feasible to consider establishing a highly

confidential source.

With regard to the MANNARINO offices at 1263 Third Avenue,

New Kensington,

Pa., It 1s noted that this is a one story,

red brick building. It 1s located completely inside a ten foot

The area between the gate,

the scrap piles and the office

building is brightly illuminated by a group of spotlights.

Recently, It has been determined that this office is protected

by the Silent Service System, an electronie burglar alarm

system

which 1s monitored directly by the New Kensington PD.

It would seem

that the most Ilkely spot to attempt to establish

a bighly confidential source would be at the MANNARINO cottage,

but efforts will have to be made to resolve some of the

problems, such as monitoring (the cottage 1s about

35 miles

rom the Pittsburgh office); ingress (the dogs ana a caretake:

whose

schedule is Irregular) and security (location and coverage

of all possible visitors, and possibllity that there 1s a

burglar-alarm installed).
