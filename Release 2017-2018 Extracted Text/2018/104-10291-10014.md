RESUME
U. S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE

More than 12 years of this service was performed while stationed

America, Europe and Africa,

While the entire service involved utilization of legal

training and conduct of investigations affecting the national

security interests of the United States, that from September

(on occasions more than 50 employees and expenditure of

extensive funds). The service also involved extensive liaison

with foreign government and other U. S. government officials.

matters of the highest sensitivity and importance and accordingly

was conducted at highest levols (Cabinet and sub-Cabinet).

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr, Birch D, O'Neal,
Cl seal

SUBJECT : Notification of Noa-oligidility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability

System

1. [have your memorandum =f 27 October 1966 which refers to my
memorandum advising you that in the initial screening of personnel eligible
to become participants in the CIA Retirement System you have been deters
mined to be ineligible because «f an apparent deficiency im “qualifying duty
It ie important that you realize that such a deficiency is caly sigalficant la
the iaitial review of Agency personnel who have |S or more years uf Agency
service since the law permits such ;-ersons to acquire at their ption a
interest in the CIA Retirement System. At the same time, the law
requires a minimum of 60 months qualifying duty betore one can possibly
qualify for retirement benefits under the CIA Retirement System. kt serves
Ro purpose, therefore, to place a person permanently in the System if there
is a possibility that he may never cualify for benefits thereia.

2. In paragraph 2 of your memorandum you indicate concern that failure
to contest the initial {indings in your case may ; rejudice the possibility of a
favorable decision with regard te your eligibility to .articipate in the CIA
Retirement System at some future date. It is cesumed that you were referring
to the possibility that you may bave some additional service that could perhapa
be considered ao qualifying duty under the System. tn noted in paragraph 2
of my memorandum «£28 September 1966, our Initial determination of
ineligibility doea not preclude reconsideration .f your eligibility at some
future date.

3. As you know, Regulation 20-50 provides ior aa appeal to the Director
of any adverse determinztion under that regulation. However, tha regulation
also provides an opportunity :or an employee to ,resent hia case to the CA
Retirement Board prior to the making of an adverse determination. Because
of the large number of employees covered in the initial screening of on-duty
employees to identify thovo eligible for participation in the System, this
procedure was not applied when, a9 in your case, the employee's Career
Service reported that he did not seet the requirements { Regulation 20-50 for
nomination 26 a ;articipant. Accordingly, the procedure «f notifying employees
of their non-cligibility tor participation in the Systen: based upon the initial
finding «f an en:ployee's Career Service has beea ‘ollowed in all euch cases.
This is contrary to the implication in ;aragraph ? 2f your memorandum that
other employces in circumstances similar to ycurs vere aot so informed and
I would be pleased to look more deeply into that aspect -f your memorandura,

if you wieh.



SECRET -

4. In the ovent that you have performed service which you believe to
be qualifying duty under the CIA Retirement System, you are moat certalaly
entitled to resent the details of such service to the Clandestine Services
Career Service Board for review and formal submission to the CIA Retires
ment Board, A copy =f this memorandum will be forwarded to the Executive

Secretary of that Board,

My request, tirough the support officer of the Staff to
which I ar sssigned, for a reading on retirercnt benefits
which I misct receive should I retire on 31 Decenber 1966
or five yeizs From that date, would not constitute a

THROUGH

SUBJECT 2 Notification o OF Designation as a
Part tcipant tag At-and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in thé’ procead-oF reviewing the employment
history and current career fietd of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service, If.the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for partictpetion in the System, this nomina-
tion 16 reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requiresents of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this’ {{nding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys=
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

3 sof UR 20-$0 for designation as a partict=
pant and I have accordingly maie the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation, From a review of your
record 1t appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years cr more of Agency service, but have not a8
yet performed 60 months of quatitying service as required by regulation, My
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement Syatem,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System 1f you should met the requirements for designation in the

future,
3, Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation asa participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

you read paragraph. e of HR 20-30 and paragraph $ of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entieled “Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 196%

tov Certain Employees."

4. Lt ts always possible that the recards upon which the determination
made in your case may have bee complete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the asency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligt-
ble to participate in the C1A-Setirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss then with you. In addition, you may wish to dls-
cuss yolir case with the C1A Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine
Building (extension 2847), 11 such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligi! tay request that your case be formally
considered by the CIA Retirement Board, However, this request must be made with-

in 30 days of the date of this memorandum, sat

Mr, O'Neal in order that he may be enabled to carry out his duties
in a secure and afficient manner, The use of 4 cormmisatoned title
In this tnetance, which has been discussed at length with appropriate
offices of ARA, is believed necessary in order to irake possible the
appearance of a complete break between Mr. O'Neal and the previous
OSO station chief, and in order to provide him with adequate cover
which will integrate him completely into the Embassy in a country
whose present Government is noticeably hostile and vigilant with
regard to American intelligence activities. It ls proposed that
Mr, O'Neal will serve in the Holitical Section of the Eunbassy. He
will replace Mr. Collins D. Almon, who returned to the United

States in March 1981.

‘The proposed blography for Mr. O'Neal will be forwarded

sometime prior to 1 December 1951, this office will endeavor to comply
with your proposals, I might say that Mr. O'Neal has done a superior job
as Alien Affairs Officer fur the Agency. There has been some thought
given to transferring the Alien Affairs Branch from I&S to the immediate
office of Mr. Dulles, and it is impossible to give a positive guarantee of
his availability, which in that case would be dependent upon Mr. Dulles!

decision.
I feel, however, that OSO could at least tentatively plan along the

line of your proposal. The cooperation of the ADSO and Chief, FDT, in
making Mr. O'Neal available has been sincerely appreciated.
