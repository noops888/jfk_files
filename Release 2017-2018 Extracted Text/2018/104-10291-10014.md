Rand Disability System

le. As you may know, de are in the proces

reviewing the employment

history and

current carcer field of all emplogees in the Agency so Identify

chose who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA

Retirement and Disability System.

In this process, che initial review of

each case lo made by the indiridual's Career Service, If. the Head of hle

Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-

tion da reviewed by the ClA freirement Board ahich recommends final action

to me. However, If the Head at the Career Service aduises that the employee

does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, l have

accepted this finding withoug further review by the lA Retirement Board.

This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting thie screening

process so that those employces sno are eligible to participate in the Sys

tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2, In your case, the Hesi of your Career Service has advised me that

you do not meet the requiremenis of HR 20-50 for designation

as a particl

pant and I have accordingly mair the formal determination required by the

regulation that you are not cligible for designation.

From a revlew of your

record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you have 15 years of more of Agency service, but have not as

yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My

determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no

way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,

nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility

to participate in

the ClA System if you should met the requirements for designation in the

future.

Should you desire

furcher Information concerning the requirements

for designation

as a participare in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

read paragraph. e of HR 20-30 and paragraph S of the Employee Bulletin

dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Diblic

Law 88-643. The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1986 for Certain Emplovees."

4. It 1s always possible that the records upon which the determination

made in your case may have born incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual

employment history with the forney.

If, after studying the matertals cited

have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi

to participate in the CiA irtirement System, please feel free to contact

officials of your Career Service.

They are familiar with the detalla of your

case and will gladly discuss then with you.

In addition, you

may wish to dis

cuss your case with

the CIA friirement Stal: located in Room 205, Magazine

Building (extension 2847).

• Security.Officer

SUBJECT: O'NEAL, Birch D.

DATE: 13 February 1951

Reference to your memorandum concerning return to duty of Subject

sometime prior to l December 1951, this office will endeavor to comply

with your proposals. I might say that Mr. O'Neal has done a sujerior job

ag Alien Affairs Officer fur the Agency. There has been some thought

given to transferring the Alien Affairs Branch from I&S to the immediate

office of Mr. Dulles, and it is impossible to give a positive guarantee of

his availability, which in that case would be dependent upon Mr. Dulles'

decision.

I feel, however, that OSO could at least tentatively plan along th

line of your proposal. The cooperation of the ADSO and Chiel, FDT, i

making Mr. O'Neal available has been sincerely appreciated.
