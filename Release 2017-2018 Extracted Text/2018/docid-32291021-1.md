that time, DONOHUE attempted to learn the scope of the rBl

investigation concerning him.

He asserted that individuals

contacted by the FBI concerning him had advised him of these

contacts.

When asked to be more specific by ASAC HOWELL,

DONOHUE said that Mr. FRANK RUSSELL of Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

a diamond importer had informed him that he had been

interviewed by Milwaukee Agents concerning DONOHUE'S

activities. DONOHUE asserted that RUSSELL, who had given him

business in the past, seemed reluctant to discuss business

opportunities with him in view of the FBI investigation.

invest sation-s

It is noted that from 11/19/57, to 5/30/59,

DONOHUE was a Registered Agent for

the Dominican Republic.

The investigation of DONOHUE indicates that he

is acquainted with United States Senator DENNIS CHAVEZ of

New Mexico and CHARLES DAVIS, Administrative Assistant to

Senator CHAVEZ•

The Bureau advised on 6/5/61, concerning DONOHUE

that in view of CHARLES DAVIS'

past record an interview of

him in the investigation of DONOHUE did not appear advisable.

or would it likely be productive.

The records of the Willard Hotel as reviewed on

1/24 and 27/61, reflected the following information concerning

CARLOS MARCELLO:

MARCELLO checked into the Willard Hotel at 8:45 p.n.

1/22/61, and was assigned Suite 701-02-041. Also checking

into the Willard with MARCELLO was one J. J. AMATO. MARCELLO

and ANATO checked out of the Willard at 4:00 p.m., 1/24/61.

The foregoing information concerning the Willard

Hotel was furnished on a strictly confidential basis by

NT • ROLAND BEAULIEU, Executive Assistant Manager.

WFO notes that the Willard Hotel meets the

description of a large well known hotel in the downtown area

with a flight of outside stairs leading to the lobby. This

would tend to collaborate PCI RUSSELL'S information concerning

MARCELLO's stay in Washington, D. C.
