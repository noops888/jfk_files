Subject: CIA Files on Lee Harvey Oswald

This is to acknowledge my telecon yesterday with Dave Gries-and with Jobn
Pereira re issue of whether Oswald was ever debriefed by the Agency, and to
respond to John's request ‘for documents which may having bearing on this
issue. .

First, a point of order. It is my belief and the belief of the Agency porsonnet
with whom I have discussed this matter, that your files should not contain the
infamous “debrief.” It strains credibility that the Agency would purposely
persist in saying there was no debrief when in fact it had a copy of it
somewhere in its extensive - if sometimes sloppy.— records system. It
would have been found by 1993. The issue is not whether you have it now;
rather it is whether it occurred in the past and was destroyed.

We.can all talk, theorize and argue over what it might mean Jater. For now
the task at. hand is simply to take all necessary steps to find out. I urge
extréme caution in stating flatly that there was io debrief until such steps
have been thoroughly exhausted." I'was susprised to find out after the
FRONTLINE: documentary aired, for example, that there will be some new
pieces on this subject i in the not too distant future.

Tattach a copy of CIA document number 287-690, memo for record, dated
3 December 1963, by Mr. Birch D. O'Neal, Chief, CI/SIG, Subject: Lee
Harvey Oswald. O'Neal's memo is about polygraphing Alvarado, but it is the
teverse handwriting in the upper right hand comer that is pertinent to the
issue at hand: That handwriting appears to be: “Andy Anderson OO on
Oswald."

7. ns
I refer you to Mr, a CIA employee in the Contacts
Division in 1962, who told the HSCA in 1978 that he read Anderson's debrief
and described its contents to his HSCA interlocutors. He will tell you today
what he has been saying for 30 years, loes not have a book
and shuns any publicity -- it took FRONTLINE almost a year to get him to
agree to an interview on the record. He says what he says not for any
personal gain because there is none, there is only disrepute. He says it
because he remembers reading the debrief.

If I were you, I would first have a long talk with Then I would find all
surviving members of CD/OO/Support Branch. It did not take us long to
figure out that this branch interfaced with the ficld offices of the Contacts
Division. While this will not tum up a piece of paper, I think you will find
some answers there.

As an aside: a Mr. Roe F. Anderson was listed in the CIRA obit this summer,
and his son Richard called me after the FRONTLINE documentary aired, and
confirmed his father, a Navy officer, had worked for the CIA. I doubt if this
is our Anderson, but you might check all the same. I would appreciate a note
stating what you find out.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jolin M. Newman

at the time Lee Harvey Oswald retumed to the US in the Summer of 1962.
T.B.C. stated he discussed the laying on of interviews with Oswald, either
while he was en route.or after his arrival. Because T.B.C. made a
typographical error when he typed "1960" instead of "1962", the LISCA
foolishly dismissed the veracity of this entire document.
