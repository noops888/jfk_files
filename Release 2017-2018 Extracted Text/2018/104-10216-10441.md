Handuriting Assessent Befort

The writer is apparently a rather clever and shrewd individual

who nay appear core correct aud haruless than actually is the case.

but he is deliberate and cautious before setting hinself irto a new

or altered situation.

he is a cool and calculating observer no re-

lates the smallest details to sheir larger aspects.

ris synthesizing

faculties are more pronounced than his analyzin, abilities; he is quite

skillful "in putting two and tuo together" from

the things he sees and

hears. dost people in his envirornert may not even be aware of his

astuteness

and

vigilance, as he nay intentionally

convey the impression

of being preoccupied with his own thoughts.

Ee discards sugerfluous

matters as much

as possible, but occasionally the vitil points in

more complex or unfaniliar problems have to be pointed out to hin, as

he could miss them when left to his own devices.

Le tries to co-bine

inazination with sober mdedness and matter-Of-iactness, but not al-

ways successfully.

As a result, he say be, at times, sorevrat awkward

and unrealistic in his approach.

te possesses zore mental indepezdence

than he cares to show and while pretandira to conform, say follow some

private personal irclinations.

lodever, he does not possess much

originality and seems to try out various forms und thought patterns

, with which he can identify himself.

Ã¼e is active and curious and

constantly tries to broaden his horizon.

he is still in the process

of mental developrent and Jouth and he

is not jet quite able to gauge

the risks and consequences when he crercises initiativ:. Ee may be

avare of this and compensate by internittent overcautiousness.

Basical-

ly rather impressionable, he makes strong efforts at concentrating

intensely on shat be is doing, shutting out all jossible distractions

and diversions.

His menory functions well, and he scems to have

cumulated a rather diversified store of knowledge and information.

The writer is not a born organizer, but he tries to arrange his

affairs properly and to be as systenatic and methodical as possible, in

order to avoid confusion. He is active and versatile aud can make sud-

den changes when required. He possesses great facility in expressing

hinself in

word and script. He has sone skill in adjusting his style

to that of the people he is talking to-

Wrile he can be rather elo-

quent, he is not likely to divulge anything which sho :ld be kept

secret.

He has some intuition and also sensitivity for selecting and

judging the profer quality of muterial for a definite purpose. Also,

he poseesses manual skill which he could exploit in different ways.

while he has leurned to figure and calculate, this sctivity does sot

seen to hold his interest.

levertheless, he is concurned with money.

He is rather

free in spending it and nay not always set alon; with

the means at his diegosal. In his selected profescional field, he

should be a 500d student who

activates all his resources for iroper

advancesent, even

though he zay have a ruber of additional interests.

Enotionalli, the writer is not quite mature and he hides behird

a more sorhisticited and fois:d bearine-

Ee hus his feelings ard im

pulses under the atrictest control.

He is a role player who ray affear

nore natural and spon-aneous tran he actually is.

He is detached,

very reserved and avoids erotional involvement whenever possible, even

though be may pretend the optosite.

He is self-centered and rather

vain, and most concerned with nis personal advantage.

lie is quite

proud and occasionally lilics to play the big shot.

He is very self-

defensive and self-rrotective, constantly guarding hirself against real

or inaginary dancers.

Apparently, he tries to steel hirself, in order

to be tougher than he constitutionally is. lis erotional sense of

proportion is not well balanced; he nay overenphasize an insignificant

incident, while he disrecards an important happening

As a result, he

may take

unwise crances, in order to show how courageous he is, while

at other times ke is cowardly in situations which are not dangerous at

all. Eowever, whatever mistakes he way make in this area, he nili

cover them up most skillfully.

He is very secretive about his affairs

in general and does not confide easily in anybody.

There is little

consatezey in his esotional attitudes, and he could surprise those in

his closer environent by rather unexpected actions and reactions.

The oniy erotional ties he has zay be to his traditional background;

otherrise, he does not ossser "uch lessiti.

deceptive rechanists in the rost adroit fashion, and while deconstrat

ing a swooth behavior.

but he can mister sufficient strength at present to support his function

Apparently, the writer dissipates his efforts somewhat and tries

to do nore

than he can handle comfortably.

In spite of his occasionally

overbearing attitude, he is still in zeed of guidance, and probably func

tions best in a clearly structured environment.

ke tries to be zeat and

orderly.

When he does not divide his attention, he can be exact, con-

scientious and reliable in the execution of his tasks.

Eowever, under

pressure, he can becone careless and negligent and then camouflage nost

skillfully any suortconings in his work. He should have sone capability
