inga special group meeting. And it was left that that was on the}
record vague. After the special group meeting, did the CIA
station in Santo Domingo push further for the delivery of weapong
as a gesture of U.S. support of dissidents?
Mr. Colby. Yes, there was considerable discussion with
a dissident group down there. And the question -~- they made |
i
a particularpoint out of needing some warrant of our serious
interest in supporting it. And the station was urging that

this be done through the provision of some weapons.

Mr. Schwarz. And did the station indicate that the !

i

persons who wanted the weapons had stated that the object of cb-
taining this kind of help is the elimination of Trujillo?

Mr. Colby. Yes. And two of the individuals on the 15th

of February said that the object was the elimination of
Trujillo.’ Instead of using arms or grenades,he began to
speak of.a bomb and of poisoning.
Senator Baker. That is quoting the man requesting it?
Mr. Colby. Yes, the requestor.

He also described a possible ambush.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, who was the chief of station in

Santo Domingo in 1961?

Then in March the approval of the passage, I think,
without any substantial difference in policy, expressed in the
interim. Probably that is a formal approval. It would be
considered adequate for the actual passage in March. Now, I
imagine, however, that there was a certain amount of pre-

exchange of information with the Embassy in Dominican Republic:

and also with the State Department here.

Mr. Schwarz. On March 31, 1961 the actual passing of
the carbines was approved in a cable released by Mr. Bissell,
is that right?

The Chairman. From the State Department to the Charge,

President. And that remains to be determined positively.
