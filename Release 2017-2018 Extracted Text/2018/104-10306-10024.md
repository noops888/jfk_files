: MEMORANDUM FOR Ril

Cubs

Executive Coumittee met on Friday, January 25th, and
he rew policy as outlined by the Coov‘tinator.

Dacisions bearing on covert operations were ceached as follows:

1. The Special Group will have the responsibility of
continuing review of thé program for infiltration of covert intelli-
gence agents, Progress will be regularly check-d with the Group.
Higher authority wade a particular point of saying that, although
t the objective of ‘intensified covart collection" is approved,
nonethsless, CIA should not feel it 4@ under pressure to "yet good
men killed" in the -rocess. In other words, the advantages to be
gained from intenstited collection must be continually veighed
ageinst the risks. This will be done by the Special Group.

2. The accorney General expressed great interest in tha
extent to which key members of tho Brigade will be brought into
planning and current operations. He thought that they should be
thoroughly consulted on plans for intelligence teams and he indicated
that he will personally keep an eyo on progress in this regard.

3. The use of propaganda balloons was disapproved at this
time. It apparently was not clear ae to exactly how far CIA should
go in maintaining its current capability for launching balloons.

teieirtctete

At Mr. Bundy'’s suggestion I had a long talk with Cottrell on
Saturday, the 26th. We discussed in particular the method of operation
with the Brigade. I pointed out some of the security aspects that
would have to be watched, but expressed the opinion that a workable
method of operation could be devised eo thst the Brigade leaders
could provide motivation and could feel a sense of participation,
without having to bring them so closely into the details of target
ereas, dispatch, commo, etc., as to constitute a security hazard.

1 cited the Agency's experience with the NTS as a possible guideline
in this regard. We agreed that efter Mr. PitcGerald returns from
Panama, about the first of February, the three of us should discuss
thie matter further.

SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group, 8 February 1963

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone, Mr. Hilsman,
and Mr. FitzGerald

1. Agent Operations in Cuba

Mr. FitzGerald discussed with the Group the CIA paper of
6 February which recommends a total of five maritime infiltration/
exfiltration operations during the next thirty days.

He emphasized that these black operations are entirely of an
intelligence nature and that they should be viewed only as a
supplement to intelligence coverage accomplished by other means.
In the latter connection, the point was made that information ob-
tained by agents of this type can contribute to the targeting of
aerial reconnaissance sorties and can assist in making the process
of photo interpretation more meaningful.

Mr. FitzGerald also emphasized that the teams now proposed
are comprised of only one to three agents. He noted that the agents
available are particularly well motivated, and that those whose
primary motivation was toward action rather than intelligence have
been weeded out.

The consensus of the Group was that while agent operations of
this type cannot be considered as a primary or major source of
intelligence; nonetheless this type of operation is consistent
with U.S, objectives in the Cuba situation and that approval of
these five should be recommended.

(These missions were approved by higher authority, 9 February

1963)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group, 28 February 1963
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone

Colonel Steakley was present for Items 1-3

: : fi
1. [Reconnaissance - DOD Monthly Forecast

The Group had no objection to the BOW TIE missions as planned.
Mr. McCone alluded, however, to. the unexplained military activity
| that is going on in eastern China, and asked about the capability of

' BOW TLE to check on this. It was pointed out that the BOW TIE

program consists of comparatively shallow penetration which would i
probably not reach the kind of military target Mr. McCone had in mind. |
Accordingly, Colonel Steakley was asked to confer with COMOR to find ~
out whether requirements exist for deeper penetration in the area,
and if so to bring in an appropriate proposal to the Special Group.

In connection with project AMOS, Mr. Johnson read a message from
to the Secretary of State. said that while the
and the Will be glad to have the advantage of the
intelligence resulting from the mission, nonetheless this represents

a departure from the previous pattern of flights in the area.
Additionally, the flight will, according to| go closer ‘to the Hl
coast than the lis allowed to go. He was willing to agree to the
mission, provided it was not viewed as establishing a precedent, and
on the stipulation that Secretary Rusk personally accepts the risk
entailed. Mr. Johnson said that Secretary Rusk is willing to accept
this risk.

The Group ‘approved AMOS, subject to check by Mr. Bundy with
higher authority, and on the understanding that the Group will have
a chance to take a last look at it shortly before the scheduled date
of 19 March, Colonel Steakley was also asked to report to the Group
on the results of the mission. (This mission was later approved by
higher authority.)

In this connection, Mr. McCone commented on the great importance

of obtaining intelligence on the Soviet low-level SA-3 system. The
Group agreed that thisis a high-priority requirement, in order to]

‘[proviae a basis for estimating accurately the chances for successful

low-level penetration of the USSR. Mr. .McCone will arrange to have
a USIB paper prepared on this subject.

The Group noted the DESOTO destroyer voyage, which will now in-
clude a courtesy call at Djakarta.

Colonel Steakley told the Group that CINCLANT has tried out the
MELON PATCH photography missions, operating under the ten mile re-
striction which was laid on by the Special Group at its meeting of
31 January. It is now apparent to CINCLANT that adequate photography
of the desired areas cannot be obtained at that distance. The Group
agreed that the ten mile restriction should remain in force. In
coming to this conclusion they made the point that in case of real
need for this type of coastal intelligence, there would be adequate
time to obtain it after an emergency actually was in effect; and
further, any such information collected now would have to be up-dated
before operations could be mounted based on it.

The revised RED DOG missions, to be flown in C-47's, and the
proposal to fly some BRASS KNOB missions from the Canal Zone, were
approved,

Colonel Steakley was asked to give the Group_a report on the
results obtained from the last mission into the
Colonel Steakley told the Group that the JCS will make no

recommendation on low-level coverage of Laos (ABLE MABEL) until after
the results of the Agency effort explained below.

The Group made a point of saying that although the time is not
tiow propitious. for covering the COMOR priority targets in Cuba with
low-level flights, it may well prove desirable to do this on fairly
short notice. Therefore this matter should be kept under constant
review by operating elements

2. /'] Reconnaissance - CIA Monthly ee

Mr. McCone told the Group that the weather has suddenly opened
up over North Vietnam and that the mission to cover that area, via
Laos, which was approved by the Special Group on 17 January, will
actually be launched tonight. He said that after this is completed
the airplane will be ferried to Taiwan in accordance with the dis-
cussion at the meeting of the 25th of February, transiting Laos on
the way. Mr. McCone also reported on the recent successful GROSBEAK
mission.

3. [Removal of Soviet Troops

ait “Mr, McCone said that we still do not know very much about the

removal of Soviet troops from Cuba. Mr. Bundy stated that the

/ official government position is that available information is in-

sufficient to justify any change in the estimated figures of Soviets :
on the island, He added that no change can be made in these eaiaoanad
without specific approval by higher authority.7.

4, Testimony on Cuba

Mr. McCone commented on the difficulties encountered by
officials who are required to testify before Congressional committees
on the Cuban situation, in light of the propensity of these committees
to question witnesses on statements made by other officials. Mr.
Bundy recognized that this is a problem and said that in an attempt
to alleviate it he has had several documents brought together. These
include a compendium of the President's remarks on the subject; the
DCL's report to the Killian Committee; a report by Assistant Secretary
Martin; and most recently, the CIA-prepared paper on subversion in
the hemisphere. He added that the basic responsibility for co-
ordinating public statements rests with the Secretary of State. ee

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group, 26 March 1963
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone.

Dr. Scoville, Mr. McMillan, and Colonel Steakley were
present for Items 1-5.

Mr. Lundahl was present for Item l.

Mr. FitzGerald was present for Item 5.

1. (Bowceve Reconnaissance, Cuba

In connection with the USIB recommendation for resumption of i
low-level coverage of Cuba, Mr. Lundahl showed the Group examples t
of the additional information that can be obtained from low-level :
photography as contrasted with high-level coverage. This had to do 4
particularly with identification of materiel, spotting of personnel, 4
etc.

Mr, McCone emphasized that low-level coverage would give us i
additional information on the numbers of Soviet troops and possibly is
on Soviet intentions, and similar subjects, but that it would not I
represent a qualitative shift in the body of intelligence available. 7
It would not reveal anything that would be of major security interest i
to the U.S. and which could not be picked up by high-level coverage.

Mr. McCone also referred to the progress of certain negotiations
which have been holding up active consideration of low-level photo-
graphy. He said that there are differences of opinion among people
closest to this situation as to what the effect of resumption of such
photography actually might be on the negotiations.

Mr. Gilpatric said that Defense is not convinced of the urgency
of this proposition and would not favor it at this time, unless others
feel that there is an overriding political reason for undertaking the
project. He said that he would prefer to see this capability reserved
for identifying the type of threat that we might otherwise not be
aware of, or used at a time when there was some political advantage to
be gained by low-level flights. 7 di

ase

Mr. Johnson said that the Secretary of State does not believe \
that-there is any foreign policy reason for mounting the operation
at this time, and in fact the Secretary and other high officials in
the Department feel that from a policy point of view it would be
inadvisable now.

The Group then agreed that the resumption of low-level coverage
would not be recommended at this time, but that it would be kept
under weekly review. ]

ae é

The Group noted the intelligence justification for this proposal
and the political objections to it, and the Chairman agreed to discuss
it with higher authority as an example of a situation where clear-cut
differences of interest exist. He said that if there was any doubt :
from that quarter he would have all the principals participate in
further discussion with higher authority. (The proposal was later

disapproved by higher authority.)

3. [Peripheral Reconnaissance Operations

a. Colonel Steakley gave the following brief reports on a
number of peripheral missions:

(1) The ELINT coverage of the} produced good
results. He said that this area is now so well covered with
radars that consideration should probably be given as to whether
the rules requiring an abort in case of an AI lock-on should be

relaxed. j

(2) The AMOS mission, directed against SA-3's in the
Baltic, did not result in any ELINT take from the radars
associated with the SA-3's. He said that some question now
arises as to whether these weapons are in fact SA-3's or
perhaps a later generation of the SA-2.

(3) A DESOTO destroyer mission off the Soviet Maritime
Provinces resulted in Soviet instructions to shut down their
radars when the ship approached.

b. The Group approved four missions (UNA, DANIEL, FLOYD and
GEORGE) using new ASD-1 equipment. This includes two in the Baltic {
area, one in the Black Sea, and one flying from to the Black

Sea.7

5. Covert Operations, Cuba

a. Procedures

Noting that the shipping sabotage paper of 19 March had
not been considered by the Cottrell committee as a body, the Special
Group asked that such proposals be considered in that way before
submission to the Special Group. In passing the recommendations to
the Special Group it should be indicated what the position of the
various Cottrell members was, just as is done in the case of political
projects coordinated with State and the ambassador. Each member of
the Cottrell committee would see to it that his own agency staffed
the paper in the normal way for submission to the Special Group.

be Sabotage of Shipping

The substance of the 19 March paper was then considered.
Mr. McCone raised a question as to exactly what the U.S. objective
now is in this and related fields, and questioned in addition whether
we may be trying to manage exile groups too closely.

There was some discussion as totthe actual value of carrying
out the proposed sabotage, that is whether enough damage could be
done to hurt the Castro regime seriously. The consensus of the Group
seemed to be that activity of this kind should not be undertaken if
it could be expected to yield only small gains, but that if its
effect would be really significant then that would be a different
matter.

Considerable doubt was expressed. about the proposal for
sinking and setting fire to ships. None of the members felt that
there was any particular objection to the use of abrasives or other
damaging materials,

The proposal was then remanded for group consideration by
the Cottrell committee. This committee is asked to look at the pro-~
posal in relation toeeverything else that is going on or is under
serious consideration, in order to assess its true potentiality.

Mr. FitzGerald was authorized to modify the proposal to the extent



iin vie eeinm sero es ent MaaciamESBSE

of considering possible unilateral action as opposed to using an
exile group as a cutout. Mr. Bundy will explore-exactly what the
feeling of higher authority is with respect to relations with exile
groups.

ec, Additional Programs

Mr. Johnson mentioned the activities of the NTS, which has
been broadcasting in Russian to the Soviet troops over Radio Caribe
in the Dominican Republic. Mr. FitzGerald agreed to add this to the
possibilities listed under radio broadcasting.

Mr. Johnson questioned the extent to which proposition b.,
involving inciting Cubans to commit aggressive acts against Soviet
personnel, is in accord with current objectives.

On the matter of propaganda balloons, most members of the
Group felt that these might be useful in connection with the particular
target mentioned ~ the May Day concentration which is expected in Havana,
Mr. Johnson had some reservations which he wanted to check out further
in the Department. It was agreed that should State take a favorable
view, then the matter would be presented to higher authority.

As to the request for Defense training facilities, Mr.
Gilpatric asked that Mr. FitzGerald discuss the needs with Secretary
Vance. Mr. FitzGerald said that the principal requirement which can-
not be met in CIA facilities is adequate space for weapons training.
Members of the Group recalled that the objection to the use of Defense
facilities at the time it was presented during the MONGOOSE period,
was that this would make it difficult, if not impossible, to deny
official U.S. involvement. Mr. Bundy said that he saw no objection
if the purpose was to train Cubans for eventual open hostilities, but
thought that in this case the objective might be better achieved by
having them undergo regular U.S. Army training. The other members

agreed.

connaissance, Northern Laos

It was agreed that the proposal for this coverage, which was

Mr. McCone mentioned the difficulties which have arisen with
Sarit, noting particularly that he is unwilling to give permission
for the renewed use of Takhli until certain Thai officials return
to Bangkok from Paris, which will be around the 20th of this month.
Mr. McCone mentioned the possibility of basing the aircraft in the
Philippines or Taiwan, if the Takhli possibility should fall through
completely.

The DCI said that if it proves impossible to mount missions
designed to cover the Sino-Indian border, then three will be required
for Laos and North Vietnam. If on the other hand the Sino-Indian
missions are run, then only two additional ones would be required to
cover Laos and North Vietnam, since some of the area could be covered
in the process of the Sino-Indian coverage.

Mr. Bundy will clear these proposals with higher authority. J

Dr. Scoville reported on the difficulties encountered in ob- fu

decision can be expected before then, He said that the time before .

3. (inadvertent Overflights by Reconnaissance Aircraft

Colonel Steakley distributed a memorandum listing the four

7 inadvertent overflights of Soviet territory by U.S, reconnaissance
‘aircraft, since January 1961. :

He commented that in previous years the rate of such incidents fi
was considerably higher. Mr. Bundy asked him to provide for the Group |
in the next week or so a recapitulation of such incidents, going back
to approximately 1949.

Colonel Steakley said that both CINCPAC and the Joint Reconnais-
sance Group believe that the incident of 10 April, when an ELINT
aircraft flew over one of the Kuriles, appears to represent a violation
of established procedures and instructions. CINCPAC has asked for
a full report. \

Mr. McCone questioned the efficacy of the system of advising
Special Group members of such incidents. Colonél Steakley said that
a procedure has’ been specified and he undertook to: provide a copy to
Mr. Parrott for the information of the Group. He said that he would
take Special measures ene sure that these instructions are followed.

Mr. FitzGerald expanded orally on the paper of 9 April, giving
a@ summary of the recent results in the agent infiltration program,
and outlining proposals in this field for the next month, The Group
approved this projection, In response to.a question about the status
of Manolo Ray's people, Mr. FitzGerald said that CIA was in touch with
him from time to time, and that any plan he has to offer for activity
against Cuba will be sympathetically received, but that he has not to
date come up with any such proposal.

The comments from the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, dated 11 April,
on the three papers being considered at today's meeting were noted.
The Group requested that these comments be withdrawn and destroyed
for security reasons. With specific reference to the comment that a
proposed sabotage action should not be carried out on the target date
of the 20th or 21st of April, Mr.’ FitzGerald pointed out that this date
had been set before the status of the Donovan negotiations was known.
He said that of course no activity of this kind would be allowed to
interfere with those negotiations at this stage.

There then ensued a lengthy discussion of the entire question of
sabotage. The Group agreed that the papers before it were responsive
to requests which had been levied on CIA to come up with general and
specific proposals, On the other hand, all members of the Group
recognized that a searching examination must be undertaken in the light

of all pertinent factors, to determine whether we wish to change the
present policy. It was agreed that in order to provide a firm basis
for judgment, we must get a clearer picture of capabilities, of the
prospects of success, the extent of benefits to be gained from
successful operations, the dangers of repercussions and of reprisals,
etc., etc.

With respect to external operations to be mounted by exile groups,
it was agreed that this sort of activity poses a real dilemma,
Particularly in view of the recently-enunciated policy toward exile
raids, it becomes increasingly difficult to disavow plausibly
responsibility for such acts. The U.S. is thus placed in the position
of either appearing to be ineffective in controlling the exiles or
of beaxing the onus of active involvement in the operations.

Mr. McCone expressed great skepticism about the desirability of
proceeding with sabotage operations, to include training, until an
over-all policy is made clear on steps to be taken to assure the re-
moval of Soviet troops and on the problem of Castro. He also com-
mented on the ineffectiveness of Cuban agents and the fact that they
would undoubtedly talk if captured. Mr. FitzGerald confirmed the
second point, but felt that these particular Cubans are perhaps more
effective than the usual run.

It was decided that. probably Friday, the 19th of April, a pre-
sentation should be made to higher authority at which time all
responsible individuals should have an opportunity to express their
views. A paper will be prepared, outlining: a proposed broad program
for sabotage as well as examples of specific operations; a sense of
the seale of activity which could reasonably be expected and the
benefits from it; an estimate of what could be achieved by the use of
internal assets; possible repercussions; and how such activity would
fit into overall policy. CIA is to coordinate with State in the
preparation of this paper. ee i: eae eapeeeiee

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone

The Attorney General, General Taylor, Mr. Murrow, and
Mr. FitzGerald were present for Item l.

1. Cuban Operations

Mr. FitzGerald said that in view of the postponement of the
meeting tentatively set for tomorrow with higher authority, the
proposed sabotage actions for April will be cancelled and two caching
operations, in Pinar del Rio and Matanzas, will be substituted. The
Group approved this.

Mr. FitzGerald told the Group that in view of the negative

Hf decision on balloons, he was proposing to dismantle the capability,

s which is expensive to keep in being. He said that if it were desired

i to start the program up at any time after dismantling, it would take
about three months. A number of members of the Group felt that in a
real crisis balloons could be of considerable value. Accordingly, it
was agreed that balloons and helium should be stockpiled, with the
idea that if a situation should arise in which balloons would be use-
ful, launching could be accomplished by a'U.S. vessel, without worrying
too much about attribution under those circumstances. In commenting
on his opposition to the earlier proposition, Mr. Murrow said that he
believes that balloons can be useful as a part of an integrated
program. :

The Group then turned to discussion of the papers from the Co-
ordinator of Cuban Affairs dated April 16th, 17th, and 18th, It was
noted that there had not been time for adequate staffing of these papers
and that the principals had not been able to examine them carefully.
In this connection, Mr. McCone said that he wanted the Office of
National Estimates of CIA to review the papers, in light of their
estimative content. It was thus agreed that the papers should be
staffed and sharpened up for presentation at next week's meeting. Mr.
Johnson suggested that a possible format might be to produce one paper
which would be prefaced by the guidelines currently contained in the
Coordinator's paper of April 18th. This would be followed by a
summary of sabotage capabilities and the pros and cons of various
types, and then recommendations.

or

Mr. Bundy and Mr. McCone expressed some doubts as to whether we
are in a position to decide major problems of this type until we
have a clearer picture of what the over-all policy toward Cuba is
likely to be for the next six months to a year and a half. Mr. Bundy
pointed out that the noise level which would be involved in many of
these proposals would be considerably more than it has been to date,
and he felt that we must decide whether we are willing to accept this.
He added that he did not feel that such a development would necessarily
be bad, but it would certainly be different from the low-level
activities prevailing now. He was not sure whether, or to what extent,
it would be possible to embark on the activities proposed in the
Coordinator's papers, without a drastic change in U.S. policy. In this
connection, Mr. Johnson said that he particularly likes the proposals
for supporting internal resistance operations, since these will not
generate a high noise level.

Mr. FitzGerald. pointed out that the paper of April 17th, on a
"Maximum Covert Action Program" consists basically of sabotage and
harassment, plus support to Cuban exile groups and individuals who
may be responsive to our advice but certainly not to our command.

He mentioned some of the difficulties that would flow from supporting
one group and not others. Mr. McCone said that if such groups become
active, it will be obvious that they have U.S. support because it is
well known that they do not have adequate assets now. He and Mr.
Bundy agreed that, despite the fact that some Central American govern-
ments might be used as cutouts, the U.S. would be blamed for their
activities and this must be clearly recognized before embarking on
such a course. They felt additionally that we must be sure that such
a program would contribute to over-all policy objectives.

Mr. McCone and Mr. FitzGerald referred to the CIA estimate that
time isrrunning in favor of Castro, and Mr. FitzGerald ‘said that
some of these activities are designed to slow down or, sible stop
the trend of events in his favor. A

2. [Reconnaissance of Laos and Vietnam 7S

Mr. McCone referred to a paper prepared by the JCS at the
request of the Secretary of Defense, outlining a possible schedule
of reconnaissance missions over Laos and Vietnam, which seemed to
Mr. McCone to be unduly heavy. Mr. Gilpatric explained that the
paper had been drawn up as an annex to a draft contingency plan,
and was responsive to a direct request from the Secretary of Defense
to indicate a sizeable capability for high-level reconnaissance for
intelligence purposes. Mr. Gilpatric added that it is clearly under-
stood that such activity would not represent a "show of force," and
that the latter would requfre low-level activity. Mr. McCone agreed
with this peint and emphasized the unusual sensitivity of any high-
level reconnaissance of denied areas.

Mr. Gilpatric assured the Group that these plans are all of a
contingency nature and that at this point they are by no means

(cotonet Steakley said that from the JCS point of view, such

/ feints might represent a tactical advantage, in that they could

divert enemy defenses from actual operations. On the other hand,
the JCS procedures are designed so as not to be provocative in
connection with peripheral and BOW TIE missions, He felt that this
proposal, which is frankly designed to be provocative, could have
the effect of inducing quicker and more intensive reaction to the
JCS flights.

On the understanding that the feint activities would be closely
coordinated with military missions in the area, it was agreed that
the proposed program should be tried for the month of May. At the
end of this period, a report on the results will be made to the
Special Group. ]

4. (Low-Level Reconnaissance, Cuba 71%

The DCI said the USIB unanimously reaffirmed yesterday the
priority intelligence requirements for low-level coverage of Cuba.
Mr. Bundy added that there is high-level interest in reviewing this
situation, E

Mr. Johnson said that in the view of the Bureau of Intelligence
and Research of the State Department, the Soviets would interpret
a resumption of low-level flights as an indication of the adoption
by the U.S. of a harder line toward Cuba, More significantly,
Ambassador Thompson is very much opposed to such resumption at this
time; he feels that this could result in a reduction in the rate of
withdrawal of Soviet troops or a Soviet decision to withdraw none at
all in the future, and it might affect Soviet policy in Laos in a
manner adverse to U.S. interests. The importance of the Harriman i
mission with respect to this last proposition was noted. Mr. Johnson
said we should know the results of the Harriman mission in a day or
two.

It was agreed that the matter would be discussed with higher

authority this afternoon. 7

5. Proposed New Policy and Program toward Cuba

Mr. McCone opened the discussion of this topic by pointing out
that the overt and multilateral pressures now being applied to Cuba
are useful; on the other hand, while they will slow Castro down they
will not hurt him critically, and the interest of our allies in
maintaining such pressures will almost certainly erode as time passes.
Similarly, any sabotage program can hurt the Castro government, but
mot lethally; and in order to be effective at all, it must be done on

age

a continuing basis and cannot be subjected to a stop-and-go treatment.
The DCI went on to say that any such activity is bound to be attributed
to the United States and if we are to carry through with it, we must
be prepared to accept the accompanying noise level. He said that a
sabotage program will not be entirely beneficial to U.S. interests;
on the minus side, there is the fact that this will complicate the
running of intelligence operations and it could result in Cuban
retaliation. Additionally, Mr. McCone said he is not in favor of
extreme types of sabotage such as complete destruction of crops,
contamination of water supplies, etc. He would prefer open inter-
vention to this kind of thing.

The DCL said that the combination of economic and other
pressures with sabotage activities, might provide a feasible climate
for a successful attempt to fragment the Castro organization. He
foresaw the possibility of such fragmentation leading to assumption
of power by a military dictatorship, which would probably be friendly
to the U.S. In this connection, Mr. FitzGerald said that we have
a line on certain high-ranking officers who are not entirely sympa-
thetic to the regime. He pointed out, however, that a major opera-
tional obstacle to capitalizing on this situation is the difficulty
of persuading éndividual Cubans of this type to place their trust
in each other, In addition, we will have to be able to assure them
that the U.S, will be sympathetic to possible successors to the pre~
sent government, even though such people may have been former Castro
supporters.

Mr, FitzGerald touched on the proposed support to selected Cuban
exile groups, for autonomous operations, as being one of the key points
of the possible new program. He made the point that there ig no use
in the U.S. trying to deny that it backs such operations, since it
will be accused of this in any case, and the accusations will be
generally believed; further, such a posture is not detrimental to U.S.
interests. Mr. Bundy agreed with this point. He added, however,
that a "scenario" will have to be worked out, clearly indicating who
in. the government should respond to accusations in this field and
what in general they should say.

Mr. Bundy questioned a statement in the paper to the effect that
covert action which might be used as a pretext for overt military
intervention is ruled out. Mr. McCone and Mr. FitzGerald said that .
the purpose of this statement was to indicate that the covert program
is not specifically directed toward the end of providing such a
pretext, but that it is not intended to preclude such a situation if
it should turn out to be desirable at some time in the future.

Mr. FitzGerald then described a number of possible sabotage
operations. In this connection, he pointed out that the paper con-
tains a proposal for the placing of limpets, carrying suitable delay
mechanisms, on the outside of Cuban ships so as to explode at sea.

He noted that Secretary Vance does not particularly like this pro-
position because of the possibility that the explosions would be
attributed to torpedoes. While recognizing the validity of Mr.
Vance's argument, Mr. Gilpatric felt that this risk was acceptable.

The Chairman summed up the preliminary reactions of the Group to
the proposals as follows:

a. The proposition for dealing with selected exile groups
is a good one, but the method of dealing with them will have to be
more carefully defined.

b. There is no objection to limpets, subject to further
technical studies.

c. Surface attacks on Cuban ships do not appear particularly
attractive, nor do shore-based attacks of a similar nature.

d. Externally mounted hit-and-run attacks against land
targets appear worthwhile. The operations in this category which
can be run in May, will be discussed with higher authority. Refineries
and power plants seem to be particularly good targets. Operations
3 of this kind will be especially valuable if done in conjunction with
other resistance activities.

e. Internal resistance should be stimulated, again in
conjunction with related operations.

Mr, Bundy said he would mention this project to higher authority.

7. Final Status Report, Italian Election Project

Mr. McCone ran over the highlights of the prognostication for
the Italian elections, as summarized in the CIA paper of the 22nd of
April. He noted that virtually all the allocated money will have
been passed by this time. Mr. Bundy said that the CIA forecast is
generally consistent with reports he has had from

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SPECIAL GROUP

SUBJECT: Proposed New Covert Policy and Programs Toward Cuba

As a follow-up to yesterday's Special Group discussion on the
proposed new covert policy and programs toward Cuba, the following
decisions have been made:

On Item 1. of the summary from the Coordinator of Cuban
Affairs, dated 19 April, additional planning and consultation is
approved. This will include further refinement of the Rules of
Engagement (in this connection, also see the minutes of yesterday's

- meeting); an assessment of the capabilities of specific groups;

and an estimate of the scale and scope of activities which selected
groups could carry out successfully.

Item 2.a. of the above-mentioned paper is approved. To
the extent possible, it is desired that the Special Group be in-
formed in advance of specific proposals under this heading... It is
recognized that this willin many cases not be feasible.

Item 2.b. is disapproved.

Further planning for individual elements of Item 2.c. is
approved, with the understanding that targets will be justified in
terms of their usefulness rather than with regard to the noise level
they might generate. Specific operations will be referred back
through normal channels (i.e., the Special Group in the first instance)
for final approval before execution.

Item 2.d. is approved.

missions (both contained in papers from the Coordinator of Cuban
Affairs dated 7 May).

There was no objection by the Group to any of the infiltration/
exfiltration operations. This approval includes the seven CIA
operations, the infiltration of a radio operator in support of the
U.S. Army, and approval of rendezvous opportunities which may arise
without adequate time to bring them to the Group. The Group also
noted Mr. Cheever's description of a proposed exfiltration to be
carried out by the MRR, with some support by CIA.

With regard to the two sabotage missions, Mr. Cheever said that
he thought the chances were excellent of carrying them out successfully.
He said, however, that the critical problem would arise the following
morning, when sea and air interception might well take place. He
emphasized that under the circumstances that could be expected in the
aftermath of such sabotage, the Cubans might well disregard any
territorial limits in the course of hot pursuit of the saboteurs.
He added, in answer to questions, that there is no doubt that Cubans
would recognize these operations as being externally mounted, and
that. the agents would certainly talk if captured.

Mr. Cheever mentioned three possible operational plans which might
minimize the danger of capture by Castro forces, but emphasized that
these were by no means operationally well-designed nor was he re-~
commending them, and further that they did not come within any exist-
ing policy approvals.

The feeling of the Group was that the damage that could be done
to the Cuban economy by successful execution of either of these
missions was not sufficient to outweigh the disadvantages. The Group
recognized that the responsible CIA operators feel themselves under
obligation to continue to develop suitable proposals, and they thought
that CIA should be encouraged to keep on doing this, The difficulty
of maintaining agent morale in the face of continued inaction was
recognized. Mr. Cheever was commended for his frank and explicit
outlining of the pros and cons.

4. Cuba - NTS Broadcasts

Mr. McCone and Mr. Cheever said that CIA does not object to the
Department of State's proposal to subsidize NTIS broadcasts from the
Dominican Republic, addressed to Soviet troops in Cuba. They pointed
out that this concurrence is subject to the caveats that the Agency
will be unable to accept responsibility for monitoring and control of


the content of the broadcasts, and that contact with the NTS will
have to be made through its headquarters in Frankfurt, rather than
directly with the U.S. representative of the NTS. With these under-
standings, the proposal was approved =

{ The CIA paper of 3 April 1963 on the above subject was approved.

‘The CIA paper of 3 May 1963 on the above subject was approved. ]

7. Intelligence on Cuba +

Mr. McCone said that he is concerned about gaps in U.S. intelli-
gence on Cuba, He said that this leads him to favor resumption of
low-level reconnaissance. The other members of the Group felt that
under existing circumstances, this type of reconnaissance will not
meet the needs that Mr. McCone perceives. Mr. Johnson suggested
that penetrations of the Cuban Government would be more productive
in trying to assess Castro's possible intentions.

Sabotage Program, Cuba

In connection with the new Cuba sabotage program approved
yesterday, Mr. McCone suggested that CIA make a report to the Special

felt that such a report need not be in written form. nor very elaborate,
and that it should consist of a briefing on activities during the
preceding period and those planned for the next one. Mr. Bundy
commented that keeping the Group informed in this way constitutes
protection to the operators, since all agencies concerned are thereby
given a continuing feeling of just what is going on.

likely to end up with a far worse situation.

might emerge. Mr. McCone added that he personally feels very uneasy

Cuba - Status of Soviet Personnel and Materiel

Mr. McCone reminded the Group that he had asked for a review of
intelligence reports on the situation inside Cuba over a 90-day
period, so as to see whether any possible pattern might emerge. He
said this review is just now being completed, it having involved
examination of 30,000 to 40,000 separate reports. He expects a draft
to be available to him by Monday or Tuesday. This will. probably take
the form of an Agency memorandum, but DIA will be asked to review it.

The Chairman said that the Cuban situation will be of great
importance in connection with Governor Harriman's negotiations;
accordingly, he asked that an informal reading on the results of
this review be made available as soon as possible, before a formal
paper is fully completed.

Mr. Smith then summarized CIA's latest views on the status of
Soviet personnel and equipment. He said that there is insufficient
evidence on which to base any change in the current estimate of
12,000 to 13,000 Soviet troops. He said that it appears the Soviets
are now engaged in training Cubans for eventual transfer of Soviet
equipment to them. No combat equipment has been seen leaving Cuba,
since last fall.

Mr. Smith added that the equipment which was seen leaving on
6 July appears on close examination by photo interpteters to be
communications and generator vans, rather than missile guidance
equipment.
gz

Mr. McCone said that the| Ambassador to Cuba has ex-
pressed his conviction that some offensive Soviet missiles still
remain in Cuba. CIA and State will debrief the Ambassador on this
point today. F

3. Cuba ~ Agent Operations

Mr. FitzGerald told the Group about two additional infiltration/
exfiltration operations which were carried out in the last days of
June, after his last report. He then mentioned highlights of proposals
for the next month. These proposals, as presented in the Coordinator's
paper of 9 July, were approved.



Mr. McGeorge Bundy said that by the 26th of July the Harriman
negotiations in Moscow might have reached a crucial stage; he asked
how flexible are the sabotage operations planned for that day (as
explained by Mr. FitzGerald to the Standing Group on Tuesday). He
said he was not suggesting that any change in the basic guidance for
sabotage operations is indicated, but it is evident that in times
of paxticular sensitivity all potentially provocative activities
should be subject to review.

In this connection, Mr. FitzGerald said that because of light
factors these operations could not be run any later than July 28th,
in this month's moon period. He pointed out that if it should appear
that it would be advisable for political reasons to postpone the
operations until the August dark-of-the-moon period, then as much
advance notice as possible should be given the agents,iin order not
to damage their morale unduly. It was agreed that by. the time of
next week's Special Group meeting it should be possible to make some
kind of judgment about the possible progress of the Harriman talks,
and that a decision could be made at that time whether or not to
postpone these particular operations.

Mr. Colby outlined the results of the past month's agent operations.

necessary to cancel the operation once more.

2 and 5.C.

Dr. Whelan, Colonel Ledford, and Mr. Cunningham were present
for Items 3 and 4.

1.  A_Non-Violent Program to Inhibit Free World and Neutral Tzade
with Cuba

The operational proposal dated 12 August, was approved by the
Special Group, with the two changes in wording made by the State
Department. Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that to make this operation
convincing, a "big bang" on a Cuban ship will be carried out before
the operation is implemented. He further pointed out that in paragraph
2.a. of the paper, the reference to "real ... sabotage" applied to
Cuban shipping only. Item 2.c. in the operational proposal was thought
to be of low priority and is to be placed at the bottom of the list.

2. Cuba - Support of Autonomous Anti-Castro Groups

Mr. FitzGerald recommended that the paper dated 13 August be “Ss
submitted at this time for discussion only rather than decision by the
Special Group. This recommendation was made because the members of
the Group had not been given sufficient time to study the proposal.

The paper had been presented in hasty fashion because CIA had received
reports that the exile group in question was beginning to scatter and
prepare for an operational program not influenced by CIA.

There was some discussion of the effects of using a British
island for launching these operations and as to the desirability of
striking Cuban shipping on the high seas. Decision on this operation
was deferred until the next meeting,

A. Mr. McCone briefly described the current status of Radio
' Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RadLib). He stated that he hoped
there would be no change in the State Department policy with respect to
the radios because of the extensive commitments, international agree-
ments, and political implications in RFE and RadLib. Mr. McCone
indicated that there appeared to be a feeling in some quarters of the
, Department of State. that, because the U,S, may be entering a period of
| "detente" with the Soviet Union, efforts should be made to reduce’ the
causes of tension and conflict, Since the two radios are major
'. igritants to the Soviets, CIA should, therefore, modify or reduce
') some of these activities. The Special Group opined that this was not
the time to change U.S. policy with respect to RFE and RadLib, Mr,
Johnson said he would look into this further,

B. The matter of the Soviet attempt to establish a consolidated
| headquarters at Lietzenburger Strasse in West Berlin, was raised by
\ Mr, McCone, He opposed such a development forthe following reasons:
(1) The formation of such a headquarters would lay the
groundwork for future Soviet claims to an equal footing with the
U.S. in West Berlin.

(2) Its establishment would severely handicap CIA operations
against the USSR target in West Berlin,

(3) Such a center would improve on the USSR's ability to
concentrate its operations against Western targets.

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and General Carter

Mr, FitzGerald was present for Item 1.
Mr. Herbert was present for Item 2.
Mr. Baird was present for Item 3.

1. Cuba ~ Infiltration/Exfiltration Operations

Of the 13 Cuban operations approved by the Special Group, 2 are.to be
externally-mounted sabotage operations which will be subject to
possible reconsideration up.to 12 August 1963. The other 11 operations
approved are designed to meet the need for expanded intelligence
collection activities and to develop viable internal resistance
organizations.

Mr. FitzGerald made a special report o.. Luis Somoza's conversa-
tions with exile leaders. Somoza wants the Cuban exiles to begin
aggressive harassment operations against Castro and indicated that
the Nicaraguan government was willing to give them a base as well as
support, including military aid. Somoza intimated that this may result
in Castro's launching an offensive against Nicarague. If this occurs,
Somoza would expect U.S. protection and possibly intervention. Mr.
FitzGerald further stated that Manuel Artime, leader of the Movement
for Revolutionary Recovery, would be in the U.S., at which time all
aspects of his program would be examined. In. order to avoid unfavor-
able complications. with Somoza, two operational changes will be
suggested:

ae Artime should concentrate on getting resistance started
inside Cuba and de-emphasize armed attack and external sabotage.

b. Artime should shift the main weight of his operations to
Costa Rica. There should be no break, of course, between Artime
and Somoza.

In this connection Mr. Johnson raised the Costa Rican Foreign
Minister's question regarding Artime. It was agreed that Mr. FitzGerald
would work out the language of the reply with Mr. Cottrell, giving as

much encouragement to Costa Rica's support of Artime as possible
without showing his activities.

General Carter mentioned the eagerness of William D, Pawley to
implement an operational plan against Cuba, purportedly designed to
create a situation which might ultimately require U.S. intervention.
The consensus of the Special Group was that an independent operation
organized by Pawley, would not be desirable. Efforts should be made
to bring him into CIA's current operational thinking.

Mr. FitzGerald also reported that the Attorney General had sent
Mr. Harry Ruiz Williams to the Agency to present a plan which turned
out to.be a series of 4.2 mortar attacks on the Cuban coast mounted
from Guatemala. It was agreed that such attacks, in addition to being
impractical logistically, would also tend to give substance to the
“Somoza plan" and therefore should be discouraged.

3. [GIA Training activities 96

Mr. Matthew Baird, Director of CIA's Training Activities, made
an oral report on CIA's counterinsurgency training and courses. Mr.
Baird emphasized that ever since the establishment of the Office of
Training in January 1951, CIA has concentrated on the covert aspects
of training. It has not duplicated in any way courses offered by the
Department of Defense, the Foreign Service Institute or universities.
During fiscal 1963, CIA sent over 2000 students to 1275 courses at 166
government and educational institutions. In addition, during the same
year, CIA trained 4214 students in 432 runnings of 64 different courses,
all directly or indirectly relating to counterinsurgency. Hy

Mr. Baird said that strong emphasis has always been placed on
resistance operations and guerrilla and paramilitary activities. The i
methodof instruction in CIA is based on case studies of current
operations. CIA trained, during fiscal 1963, 150 junior officers (with
a drop out of less than four per cent) and gave instruction to 174
foreign personnel in counterinsurgency, or directly related fields. :

Mc. Bundy raised the question as to how CIA courses were inspected.
General Carter replied by pointing out that these courses are con- ‘
tinuously inspected by the Inspector General, the President's Board of \
Consultants, and the Deputy Director, Plans, who heads up the clandestine



|

The consensus was that Central Intelligence was meeting its

counterinsurgency training obligations and that because of the covert |

character of the nhs an inspection team external to CIA was

probably not desirable.

L. [Nonenty Reconnaissance Forecasts 9S

a. NRO
“ The NRO forecast for September. was approved as presented,
with one exception. This had to do with the second Laos/North Vietnam
flight, which had been requested in order to "replenish the bank."

.\ Mr, Johnson asked that he be briefed on the results of previous

reconnaissance in this area so that he could weigh the value of the
product against the political risk involved.

It was noted that this procedure will not delay operations,
since one approval remains outstanding for Laos/North Vietnam.

b. DOD

The DOD September forecast was approved with the exception
of the proposed trip of the USS THOMASON. Mr. Johnson objected to
the proposal to transit the Kita Uruppu Suida Passage. He said that
the Department.is in. favor of continuing to exercise our rights of on
free navigation in the Sea of Okhotsk; but the projected voyage of '
the hydrographic ship REHOBOTH satisfies this requirement, Further,
U.S. merchant shipping does transit the Passage. In view of these
considerations, he did not believe it desirable at this time to send
a U.S. warship on this route. The Group concurred with Mr. Johnson's
position.

General Carter said that in view of certain other indications
recently received, YANKEE PASHA is considered by the intelligence
community to be even more urgent than before.

Mr. Johnson raised a question about the mission of the USS
STATEN ISLAND in the Chukchi Sea, asking whether the objective could
not be met by staying 15 miles from shore rather than 12. Colonel’)

(Steakley explained that the mission of the ship is to obtain informa-
tion on hydrographic "stations" located 12 miles out and that the
restriction suggested would not enable the vessel to accomplish this.

Mr. Johnson then concurred.

Colonel Steakley briefed the Group on certain sensitive

reconnaissance operations.

Colonel Steakley gave a brief summary of the deployment of
MIG fighters in the China coastal areas. He said that as of now there
are no MIG-21's in the area, the MIG complement consisting of 17's
and 19's. He saw no need to revise any of the projected BOW TIE

to have the USIB reassess the priority of this requirement at its

meeting yesterday, but that other matters had made it impossible to

Autonomous Anti-Castro Groups." In answer to questions, Mr. Cheever

said that the project for support of Commandos L would be useful but
not essential, He felt that the economic damage which this group might

inflict would probably be comparatively minor. On the other hand there
would be some psychological advantages to be gained, and also such
operations would serve to keep the Cuban security forces busy.

the contaminated sugar which has been in Puerto Rico.

c. Mr. Cheever discussed the "After Action Report" on the two
sabotage operations conducted the middle of August. Mr. Johnson
commented on the amount of materiel that had been left behind at the
site of one of these operations, and asked whether it is possible that
the Cuban agents did this deliberately, in order to involve the United
States. Mr. Cheever acknowledged this possibility, but felt that it
had simply been a question of "green troops" behaving in this manner

Castro's probable reaction to this sabotage. He also asked Mr. Cheever

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 5 September 1963
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone.

Mr. FitzGerald was present for Items 1 and 2.
Mr. Colby was present for Items 3-5.

1. Guba - Agent rations

Mr. FitzGerald commented on several reports from inside Cuba,
which indicate that the morale of the people was raised considerably
as a result of the Santa Lucia and Casilda sabotage operations. He
cautioned that some of these reports might be somewhat overdrawn,
but it appears certain that the sabotage did have a beneficial effect
in this way.

He then discussed with the Group the general philosophy of these
operations, and plans for the future within the capabilities of the
available agents. Among other things, he pointed out that there is
a limited number of targets on or near the coast and that the most
attractive ones are, at the same time, the most difficult to attack;
the available teams are not yet ready for assignments of this difficul!
On the other hand, smaller and more vulnerable targets are being:selectad.
It is proposed to hit a lumber mill in September.

Mr. FitzGerald went on to say, in connection with the scope and
pace of these operations, that it would not be desirable to knock out
all available targets in the near future, even if it were possible
to do so. This is because this type of attack is designed to stimulate
reaistance inside Cuba, apart from whatever intrinsic value it might
have.

The Group agreed with the approach, They felt that the reaction
to the two missiong in August was most satisfactory and that it is
essential to keep this sort of thing up, selecting a limited number of
worthwhile targets. Mr. Bundy commented particularly on the silence
that had been maintained by the agents, which has resulted in the
noise level being of a different character than might have been ex-
pected otherwise, Mr. FitzGerald was authorized to proceed with a
relatively soft target, such as a lumber mill.

SEGRET
EVES ONLY



There were some questions as to the feasibility of having some-
what larger teams, but Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that that is not
practicable. now. Mr, Bundy suggested that special attention be given
to electric power installations to the extent that adequate assets
are available for that purpose. He also noted that the two August
operations had been carried out in a professional and sophisticated
manner, which leads naturally to the accusation of Agency sponsorship.
He urged that to the extent possible attempts be made to vary the
method, for example by launching the attack from the shore side rather
than from the sea, as Mr. FitzGerald had previously said will be the
case with the lumber mill. Mr. Bundy felt that in this way the "CIA
signature" might be blurred.

The Group then discussed the paper prepared by the Board of
National Estimates, on possible Castro reaction to sabotage opera-
tions. No issue was taken with the conclusions of this paper, but
there was some discussion as to how the Soviets would react to any
requests made of them by Castro to assist him in combatting sabotage.
In this connection, Mr. McCone called attention to the increasing
currents of tension between the USSR and Cuba.

Mr. FitzGerald then summarised the results of last month's
infiltration/exfiltration operations and those proposed for next
month.

2. Cuba = Support of Autonomous Anti-Castro Group

The Group then turned to further discussion of the paper from
the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs dated August 13, on the subject of
Comandos L.

In response to objections stated at earlier meetings to the use
of a British base, Mr. FitzGerald said that it would be feasible to
take off from a point in the northern Bahamas, rather than from one of
the keys very near Cuba. This would considerably reduce the dangers
of hot pursuit.

Mr. Johnson said that purely apart from the British problem,
whether or not such a change in location would alleviate it, he does
not feel that the typeof activity proposed accomplishes the agreed
objective of reaching internal resistance elements.

The Chairman, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone all felt that support
of this group in the manner outlined, should be considered as action
additional to that designed to contact the resistance. Further, they
felt that it would be perfectly feasible, and in fact necessary, to
avoid any involvement with the British in this matter. It was finally

noting the reservations expressed by Mr. Johnson, In the event of
favorable reaction by higher authority, Mr. Bundy will talk further to

Mr. Johnson. {

Mr. McCone said that he would like to see more activity of this
general nature and asked whether this could be accomplished if larger
numbers of Cuban personnel were obtained. Mr. FitzGerald replied that
the problem {s not numbers, but the degree of training and competence.
In this connection, he noted that the Artime group should be eet to

Autonomous Anti-Castro Groupe

Mr. FiteGerald informed the Group that CIA is dropping ite
earlier proposal to support Commandos L, due to the crackdown on
exile raids by various U. &. and British government agencies. He
recomended that a plan of "selective relaxation” ba adopted, designed
te relax current stringent controls on selected anti-Castro groups in
order to avoid all raide being charged to ClA,

The suggestion is that the “selective relaxation” be accomplished
by eutherising CIA to tell appropriate U.5. enforcement agente that
certain activities are of interest cto CIA and should not be molested,
CIA would not actually gat tnvolved but would simply screen these
groups to perait some freedoa of movement on the part of the better
ones. Thia would be without the knowledge of the groups.

Mr. Johnson raised the question of difficulties of controlling

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Special Group,
5 November 1963

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Vance, and Mr. McCone. 5

The Attorney General, Mr. Helms, Mr. Cheever, Dr. Wheelon, &
and Colonel Steakley were present for Items land 2. The
Attorney General and Mr. Helms were present for Item 3,

1. Cuba - Sabotage Operation in Southeast Pinar (No, 3105).

Mr. Helms briefed the Group on the background of the mission and
on events leading up to the infiltration attempted on 21-22 October,
On the basis of available information, the best estimate is that Castro's
security forces penetrated the reception committee and laid a trap which
resulted in the capture of some personnel.

The subsequent press coverage of this affair renders the further
operational use of the mother ships REX and LIDA to be undesirable in i
the immediate future. i

i" &

2. Cuba - Infiltration/Exfiltration Operations

Mr. Cheever presented a low-key sabotage operation, No. 3111, against
a warehouse and pier on the north coast of Cuba. This activity is to be
carried out by a small commando team which will land on the pier and the
warehouse.

Mention was made by Mr. Cheever of some problems with British patrols
which have unwittingly exposed some of CIA's operations. Mr. Bundy stated H
that he would mention this to the British Ambassador and CIA would follow i
up on a service-to-service level in order to prevent further unnecessary
incidents,

In addition, the Special Group tentatively approved two other operations.
These are No. 3112, a sabotage operation against a sawmill located in northern
Oriente Province and No. 3115, the infiltration of a radio operator to provide
communications for a ratline. i

Mr. Bundy has placed the above three operations on a "fail safe" basis
pending concurrence in each case by higher authority.

3. Cuba - Peace Feelers

Mr. Bundy stated that is has come to the attention of the White
House that Castro would like to have a talk designed to bring about
some kind of “arrangement"™ with the U.S. To hear what Castro has to
say and to know on what basis he might wish to negotiate would be of
some use to the U.S. Mr. Bundy suggested that for this initial talk
Mr. William Attwood, currently on the staff of Mr. Stevenson at the
United Nations, might be a likely candidate since Mr. Attwood has been
in touch with Mr. Carlos Lechuga Hevia, the Cuban Ambassador to the
United Nations. Also, Attwood has a fairly friendly relationship with
Castro based on previous acquaintance.

In the Group discussion which followed it was thought inadvisable
to allow Mr. Attwood, while on the UN staff, to get in touch with Castro.
The suggestion was made that he might be removed from his official UN
status and then go to Cuba for the ostensible purpose of writing an
article for Look magazine. In this way it might be learned how badly
Castro might want a detente with the United States.

It was suggested by Mr. Helms that it might be profitable to
“war game" this problem and look at it from all possible angles before
making any contacts.

A further suggestion was made by Mr. Bundy that Dr. Rene Vallejo
Ortiz, Castro's aide and personal physician, might be flown to Mexico
with Castro's proposals and discuss them with the U.S. Ambassador in
Mexico City.

The Attorney General emphasized that as a prelude to all this the
U.S, must require some fundamental steps such as the end of subversion
in Latin America and removing the Soviet troops in Cuba before any serious
discussion can take place about a detente.

Mr. McCone stated that it might be possible to use again Mr.
James Donovan who is known to have excellent relationships with Dr. Vallejo.
Vallejo might be flown to the UN for such talks or better still Donovan
could go to Cuba.

It was decided by the Special Group members not to try to reach a
firm decision at this time but to study the problem for several days and

attack it again. +

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Cuban Operations

A meeting was held this morning with higher authority on the
above subject. Present were: Mr. Rusk, Mr. McNamara, Mr. Robert
Kennedy, Mr. Bundy, Mr. McCone, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, Mr.
Vance, General Taylor, Mr. Helms, Mr. FitzGerald, Mr. Cheever, and
Mr. Shackley. . .

Mr. McCone gave a brief summary of recent developments inside ~
Cuba. He stated that the military is generally loyal to Castro.:’
There have been some disorders but not very extensive. Castro's ._
internal security forces appear to be well organized. He has devel-
oped a system of informers which is becoming increasingly effective.
The economic situation is ‘deteriorating largely because of the
enforcement of economic sanctions, and Hurricane "Flora" although
its damage was not as great as originally thought. The Soviets
appear to be continuing the gradual withdrawal of. personnel from Cuba
although recently 1,000-2,000 troops have come in. There now seems
to be a kind of "Soviet MAAG" program concerned mainly with training
Cubans in all types of military activity including the handling of
missiles. There has been some removal of the more sophisticated types
of electronic equipment. Some new tanks have arrived in Cuba, esti-
mates run from 25 to 50.

Mr. FitzGerald reported on Cuban operations under six main
headings: (a) Covert Collection, (b) Propaganda, (c) Economic Denial,
(d) Disaffections in the Military, (e) Sabotage and Harassment, and
(£) Support of Autonomous Anti-Castro Groups.

(a) Covert Collection. Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that
inside Cuba CIA has three kinds of agent activities: (1) "singleton"
(2) collection nets, and (3) agents involved in “black net" operations.

“While there is encouraging improvement in the geographical spread of

these agents, there is still, understandably, a fairly heavy concentra-
tion of agents in the Havana area.

A question was raised as to how many agents in all of
these activities have been lost. Mr. FitzGerald said that in the
neighborhood of 25 had been either captured or killed in the past year.

NLY
The reasons for these casualty figures are the increasing effectiveness
of Castro's internal security forces and discovery brought about when
agents try to obtain food. No matter how good the documentation, an
outsider in a community is viewed with suspicion.

(b) Propaganda. The activities of CIA in this field are
the mailing of leaflets and. radio broadcasts. Some 30-40,000 leaflets
per month have been mailed and during a day there are 32 hours of
programs emanating from seven different stations. It is believed that
there is a very excellent listening public. The programs appeal to

people in a wide variety of jobs and professions. There is some jamming

but it is spasmodic and generally confined to Havana.

(c) Economic Denial. Mr. FitzGerald reported that the U.S.
economic denial program is contributing to Cuba's declining economy.
Mention was made that the economic denial program would be more effec-
tive if the Canadians were willing to cooperate. Up to now they have
not gone along with U.S. efforts, and they are supplying many items
essential to Cuban economy. The UK and Spain are continuing to deal
in certain types of goods required by the Cubans. Commodities going
into Cuba in 1962 from the free world reached $101 million. While this
represents less than in 1961 the amount is still too high.

(4) Disaffections in the Military. While the military is
loyal to Castro as has been noted there are indications that some leaders

would like to break with the regime but lack courage and opportunity:
Mr. FitzGerald commended a CIA-DIA task force which prepared a report
covering some 150 Cuban military leaders. Out of this figure there are
some 45 which look interesting from CIA's operational viewpoint. Mr.
FitzGerald reported that CIA is in touch with three persons who are in
the military or who have highly placed contacts in such circles. The
aim is to use these three individuals to establish contact with military
personnel inside Cuba. The principal aim is to get military leaders who
have become disenchanted with the Castro regime to dare to talk and plot
Castro's downfall with each other.

(e) Sabotage and Harassment. Mr. FitzGerald mentioned four
successful sabotage operations against a power plant, oil storage
facilities, a sawmill, and an underwater demolition operation against a
floating crane in one of Cuba's harbors. It is believed that the publi-
cation of these successful sabotage activities in the Cuban press has
tended to raise appreciably the morale of the people. Also, such
sabotage continues to keep pressure on the Castro regime and adds to the
growing economic problems facing the country.

(£) Support of Autonomous Anti-Castro Groups. The question

was asked from where would the autonomous groups operate. Mr. FitzGerald
replied that they would operate from outside U.S. territory. He mentioned



two bases of the Artime group, one in Costa Rica and the other in
Nicaragua. Also. it was hoped that the autonomous group under Manolo Ray
would soon get itself established in a working base, possibly Costa Rica.
Mr. FitzGerald said that much could be accomplished by these autonomous
groups once they become operational.

A question was asked as to what decisions remain to be made. Mr.
FitzGerald replied that we were looking for a reaffirmation of the program
as presented, including sabotage and harassment. When asked what was
planned in sabotage for the immediate future, he said that destruction
operations should be carried out against a large oil refinery and storage
facilities, a large electric plant, sugar refineries, railroad bridges,
harbor facilities, and underwater demolition of docks and ships. The
question was also raised as to whether an air strike would be effective
on some of these principal targets. The consensus was that CIA should
proceed with its planning for this type of activity looking toward ~
January.

The State Department raised questions with respect to sabotage
activities in Cuba. The thought was advanced that there may be a
relationship between such hit and run attacks on Cuba and the delay of
American convoys en route to Berlin. A further question was posed as
to the over-all importance to the United States of sabotage operations,
especially since it is so difficult to keep. them from being directly

‘attributable to the U.S. It was thought that the hit and run type effort

might in fact invoke loss of support inside Cuba and may even result in
bringing more Soviet troops back into Cuba. - Somehow the U.S. must pin
responsibility for these activities on-Castro. The U.S. in fact must be
ready to retaliate when it can be fairly well established that Castro is
attempting with arms, money and men to foment Communist uprisings in any
Latin American country,

The consensus was that since CIA's sabotage operation is in the
main low cost and since it does worry the Castro regime, denies him some
essential commodities, stimulates. some sabotage inside Cuba and tends to
improve the morale of the Cubans who would like to see Castro removed,
CIA should proceed with those operations planned for the coming week end
(November 15 through 17).

The view was expressed that CIA, in connection with the Department
of Defense, should concentrate on attempting to catch Castro red-handed
delivering arms to Communist groups in Latin American countries. It was
determined that during the next 90 days from this date an attempt would
be made by means of air patrols and surface ships to identify ships
carrying arms for Castro to Latin American countries. It was hoped that
a ship with Cuban arms could be picked up. Conversations are to be

initiated by the Secretary of the Navy with CIA to map out a three-month
operation against Cuban shipping. It was also determined that the
Colombian and Venezuelan governments should be asked to join.with the
U.S. in developing a joint patrol designed to identify ships carrying

»weapons from Cuba destined for revolutionary groups in Latin American

countries.
