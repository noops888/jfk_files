MEMORANDUM FOR:.-Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT iM

3° Robert A,

1. This memorandum is for information only,

2. In August 1960, Mr, Richard M. Bissell approached
Colonel Sheffield Edwards to determine if the Office of Security
had assets that may assist in 2 sensitive mission requiring

" gangster-type action. The mission target was (:he-Haside tomer
Fidel Castro.

3. Because of its extreme sensitivity, only a small group
was made privy to the project. The DCI was briefed and gave his
1 approval, Colonel J. C. King, Chief, WH Division, was briefed,
but all detaile were deliberately concealed from any of the
JMWAVE officials. Certain TSD and Commo personnel partici-
pated in the initial planning stages, but were not witting of the
purposs of the mission.

4. Robert A, Maheu wag contacted, briefed generally on
the project, and requested to ascertain if he could develop an en-
tree into the gangster elements as the first step toward accome
plishing the desired goal.

5. Mr. Maheu advised that he had met one Johnny Roselli
on several occasions while visiting Las Vegas. He only knew
him casually through clients, but was given to understand that
he was a high-ranking member of the ''syndicate'! and controlled
all of the ice-making machines on the Strip. Maheu reasoned
that, if Roselli was in fact a member of the clan, he undoubtedly
had connections leading into the Cuban gambling interests.

6. Maheu was asked to approach Roselli, who knew Maheu
as a personal relations executive handling domestic and foreign
acceunts, and tell him that he had recently been retained by a
client who represented several international business firms
which were suffering heavy financial losses in Cuba as a result
of Castro's action. They were convinced that Castro's removal
was the answer to their problem and were willing to pay a price
of $150, C00 for its successful accomplishment. It was to be made
clear to Roselli that the U. S. Government was not, and should not,
become aware of this operation.

7. Ths pitch was made to Roselli on 14 September 1960 at
the Hilton Plaza Hotel, New York City. His initial reaction wag
to . void getting involved but, through Maheu's persuasion, he
agreed to introduce him to a friend, Sam Gold, who knew the
“Cuban crowd." Roselli made it clear he did not want any money
for his part and believed Sam would feel the same way. Neither
of these individuals w&Mvear paid out of Agency funds.

8. During the week of 25 September, Maheu was introduced

to Sam who was staying at the Fontainebleau Hotel, Miami Beach,

lance by the FBI? It was several weeks after his meeting
with Sam and Joe, who was identified to him as a courier operating
between Havana and Miami, that he saw photographs of both of
these individuals in the Sunday supplemental "Parade." They
were identified as Momo Salvatore Giancana and Santos Trafficant,
xeapectively. Both were on the list of the Attorney General's
ten most-wanted men. The former was described as the Chicago
chieftain of the Cosa Nostra and successor to Al Capone, and the
latter, the Cosa Nostra boss of Cuban operations. Maheu called
this office immediately upon ascertaining this information.

9. In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing
is mission, Sam suggested that they not resort to firearms but,
» could be furnished with some type of potent pill, that could

be placed in Castro's food or drink, it would be a much more
effective operation, Sam indicated that he had a prospective
nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official who had
been receiving kickback payments from the gambling interests,
who still had access to Castro and was’ dn a financial bind.

10, Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD,’ was consulted and
assigne o develop’a pill that had the-
elements of rapid solubility, high lethal céntent, and little or
no traceability. Six of these iterns were produced and, after
being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr, Edward M.
Gunn, three pills were ultimately turned over to Sam for the

mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn w£8'briefed on the ultimate
use of the pills.

ll. Joe delivered the pills to Orta. After several weeks
of reported attempts, Orta apparently got cold feet and asked out
of the assignment. He suggested another candidate who made
several attempts without success.

12, Joe then indicated that Dr. Anthony Verona, one of the
principal officers in the Cuban Exile Junta, had become dis-
affected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the Junta and
was willing to handle the mission through his own resources,

13. Dr. Verona was approached and jumped at the oppor-
tunity of getting involved in an independent operation. . He waa
told that the private interests-backing the project did not want
the U. S, Government and, particularly the CIA, to know of their
involvement. (So far as thts Cffice knows, he has never divulged
his participation in the project to the Agency.)

14, He asked, as a prerequisite to the deal, that he be given
$10, 000 for organizational expenses and requested $1,000 worth
of communications equipment.

15, Dr. Verona's potential was never fully exploited, as
the project was canceled shortly after the Bay of Pigs episode.
Verona was advised that the offer was withdrawn, and the pills
were retrieved.

‘Two articles appeared in the Chicago press,
one on 16 August 1963, and one on 20 August 1963,
that suggested Sam was working-with the Agency.
The first article appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times
written by staff writer, Sandy Smith, ‘and had as ite
headline: CIA Sought Giancana Help for Cuba Spying.
It relates that the Agency reportedly was in touch
with Sam in 1959 and requested that he assist them
in obtaining intelligence out of Cuba. It also men-
tioned the Las Vegas wiretap, which the article
claimed was handled by a "Florida investigative
organization," It further went on to state that,
upon inquiry of this organization, they stated the
tap was placed at the request of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. The other article appeared in the
Chicago Daily News, authored by Columnist Tony
Weitzel, and commented that during March 1962,
Sam confronted an FBI Agent who was shadowing
him and said, "Why don't you fellows leave me
alone? i'm one of you!" Sam allegedly stated that,
after Castro's rise in Cuba, a CIA operative con-
tacted him and wanted to know if Sam could do any-
thing for the Government on the turbulent little island.
Sim said he had friends on both sides, but no clout.
‘That was it.

17. Roselli was introduced to James P. O'Connell, of this
Office, who was identified to him as an employea of Robert A,
Maheu, Associates. Over the several months of close contact be-
tween these two individuals, Roselli began to speculate as to
O'Connell's true employer and, at one point, stated that he was
convinced he was employed by the CIA, and that the project was
sponsored by the Agency, He hastened to state that he was not
forcing the issue, nor would he want confirmation of this and,
further, he would not mention this to anyone else, including Sam.
Sam was never introduced to any Agency personnel and, while CIA
wag never mentioned to him, it is Maheu's belief ha eventually sus-
pected the Agency was the power behind the operation.

18. In May 1962, because of Mr. O'Connell's assignment
to an overseas post, it was decided to turn Roselli over to
Mr, William Harvey, who was at that time Chief, Task Force W.
Harvey was introduced ag William Walker. It is not known whether
Roselli ever became aware of Harvey's true name.
