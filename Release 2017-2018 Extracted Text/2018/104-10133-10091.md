MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT

: MAHOU, Robert A.

et fort

1. This memorandum is for information only.

2. In August 1960, Mr. Richard M. Bissell approached

Colonel Sheffield Edwards to determine if the Office of Security

had assets that may assist in a sensitive mission requiring

gangstar-type action. The mission target was (the ligridationct)

Fidel Castro.

3.

Because of its extreme sensitivity, only a small group

was made privy to the project. The DCI was briefed and gave his

approval. Colonal J. C. King, Chief, WH Division, was briefed,

but all details were deliberately concealed from any of the

JMWAVE officials. Certain ISD and Commo personnel partici

pated in the initial planning stages, but were not witting of the

purpose of the mission.

4.

Robert A. Maheu was contacted, briefed generally on

the project, and requested to ascertain if he could develop an en-

tree into the gangster elements as the first step toward accom-

plishing the desired goal.

5. Mr. Maheu advised that he had met one Johnny Roselli

on several occasions while visiting Las Vegas. He only knew

him casually through clients, but was given to understand that

he was a high-ranking mamber of the "syndicate" and controlled

all of the ice-making machines on the Strip. Mabeu reasoned

that, if Roselli was in fact a member of the clan, he undoubtedly

had connections leading into the Cuban gambling interests.

MARSE::

6. Maheu was asked to approach Roselli, who knew Maheu

as a personal relations exacutive handling domestic and foreign

accounts, and tell him that he had recently been retained by a

client who represented several international business firms

which were suffering heavy finansial losses in Cuba as a result

oí Castro's action. They were convinced that Castro's removal

was the answer to their problem and were willing to pay a price

of $150,000 for its successful accomplishment. It was to be made

clear to Rogelli that the U.S. Government was not, and should not,

become ware of this operation.

7. The pitch was made to Roselli on 14 September 1960 at

the Hilton Plaza Hotel, New York City. His initial reaction was

to. void getting involved but, through Maheu's persuasion, he

agreed to introduce him to a friend, Sam Gold, who knew the

"Cuban crowd. " Roselli made it clear he did not want any money

for his part and believed Sam would feel the same way. Neither

of these individuals widevar paid out of Agency funds.

8. During the week of 25 September, Maheu was introduced

to Sam who was staying at the Fontainebleau Hotel, Miami Beach.

Its initial improssion of Sam was that of a hard, uncouth indi-

vidashwho looked and acted likes . common run-of-the-mill hood

lum. However, his living accommodations. at the hotel belied

this, is did the fact that

surveillance by the FBI.: It was several weeks after his meetin

hit that acco mained Sam was under periodie

with Sam and Joe, who was identified to him as a courier operating

between Havana and Miami, that he saw photographs of both of

these individuals in the Sunday supplemental "Parade." They

were identified as Momo Salvatore Giancana and Santos Trafficant,

respectively. Both were on the list of the Attorney General's

ten most-wanted men. The former was described as the Chicago

chieftain of the Cosa Nostra and successor to Al Capone, and the

latter, the Cosa Nostra boss of Cuban operations. Maheu called

this office immediately upon ascertaining this information.

9. In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing

this mission, Sam suggested that they not resort to firearms but.

be placed in Castro's food or drink, it would ba a much more

effective operation. Sam indicated that he had a prospective

nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official who had

been receiving kickback payments from the gambling intereats,

who still had acceas to Castro and was' in a financial bind.

10.

Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, ISD, was consulted and

assigned

to develop a pill that had the

elements of rapid solubility, high lethal content, and little or

no traceability. Six of these items were produced and, after

being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M.

Gunn, three pills were ultimately turned qver to Jam for the

mission. Neither TSD nor DI. Gunn wil briefed on the ultimate

use of the pille.

11. Joe delivered the pills to Orta. Aiter several weeke

of reported attempts, Orta apparently got cold feet and asked out

of the assignment.

He suggested another candidate who made

several attempts without success.

12. Joe then indicated that Dr. Anthony Verona, one of the

principal officers in the Cuban Exile Junta, had become dis

affected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the

Junta and

was willing to handle the mission through his own resources.

13. DI. Verona was approached and jumped at the oppor -

tunity of getting involved in an independent operation. He was

told that the private interests backing the project did not want

the U. S. Government and, particularly the ClA, to know ot their

involvement. (So far as thie Office knows, he has never divulged

his participation in the project to the Agency.)

11. He asked, as a prerequisite to the deal, that he be given

$10, 000 for organizational expenses and requested $1, 000 worth

of communications equipment.

15. Dr. Verona's potential was never fully exploited, as

the project was canceled shortly after the Bay of Pigs episode.

Verona was advised that the offer was withdraws, and the pilla

wero retrieved.

Two articles appeared in the Chicago press,

one on 16 August 1963, and one on 20 August 1963.

that suggested Sam was working with the Agency.

The first article appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times

written by staff writer, Sandy Smith, and had as its

headling: CIA Sought Giancana Help for Cuba Spying.

It relitea that the Agency reportedly was in touch

with Sam in 1959 and requested that he assist them

in obtaining intelligence out of Cuba. It also men-

tioned the Las Vegas wiretap, which the article

claimed was handled by a "Florida investigative

organization. " It further went on to state that,

upon inquiry of this organization, they stated the

tap was placed at the request of the Central Intelli-

gence Agency. The other article appearod in the

Chicago Daily News, authored by Columnist Tony

Weitrel, and commented that during March 1962,

Sam confronted an FBI Agent who was shadowing

him and said, "Why don't you fello:vs leave me

alone? I'm ona of you!" Sam allegedly stated that,

after Castro'a rise in Cuba, a CIA operative con-

tacted him and wanted to know if Sam could do any-

thing for the Government on the turbulent little island.

Sim said he had friends on bot'à sides, but no clout.

That was it.

17. Roselli was introduced to James P. O'Connell, of this

Office, who was identified to him as an employea of Robert A.

Maheu, Associates. Over the several months of close contact be

tween these two individuals, Roselli began to speculate as to

O'Connell's true employer and, at one point, stated that he was

convinced he was employed by the CIA, and that the project was

sponsored by the Agency. He hastened to state that he was not

forcing the issue, nor would he want confirmation of this and,

further, he would not mention this to anyone else, including sam..

Sam was never introduced to any Agency personnel and, while CIA

was never mentioned to him, it is Maheu's belief ha eventually sus -

pected the Agency was the power behind the operation:
