discussed below were broached.

Details of the Meeting:

2. In response to a request from Paris, ANWHIP-1

~ was given a security briefing for his trips to Europe.
We paid particular attention to the need for security
eonsciousness while telephoning his KUBARK contacts at
the various embassies in Europe. le stressed Frasce in
particular as it had been this station which reported a
cortain laxity in AMWHIP-1'a security practices in
Paris, AMWHIP-1 appreciated the advice and guidance
and said he would adbere to it in the future. He in
turn stated he felt that "Roberto" should begin meeting
him in more secure places than his hotel room, where
apparently the majority of the AMWHIP-1/Roberto sestings
take place. We stated wo would take this up with Boberto
ip Paris prior to AKWHIP-1's projected trip during the
week of 21 March. 1

3. It was also suggested to AMWHIP-1 that due to
the sensitivity of the UNSNAPU-19 CA operation he vas
about to undertake,be forego meeting any KUBARK staffers
in Europe during hia forthcoming trip. He was told he
should contact only Roberto in Paris since this had been
specifically requested by Roberto and his meetings with
Roberto should be kept to a minimsum, Any information ke

obtained from his trip which could not be teld until his

transuission to the undersigned et Headquarters.

Rafee! Garcia Bango Dirube

4. AMWHIP-1 was asked if he tnew Garcia Bango (GB)
whom we described as o lawyer, 33 years old, who bad just
arrived in Madrid and claimed that he had a message
obviously coming from AMLASH-1 or members of his group.
AMWHIP-1 replied that he knew GB who had been a friend
of AMLASH-1's for tbe past twenty years. ANTHIP-1 stated
that GB was essentially a crook, and his assesssent of
GB correeponded pretty well with that forwarded in MADR 3483
(IN 24295), AMWHIP-1 stated it was possible, but not
probable, that GB had been sent by the AMLASH group to
Convey the sessage as indicated in the forementioned MADR
cable, AMWHIP-1 further stated he felt GB vould be
personally loyal to AMLASH-1 tn spite of any DSZ suggestion
to the contrary, (This again is a feeling which AMWHIP-1
bad and is not to be taken as gocpel.) He also mentioned
the brother of GB, Jorge, on whoa there are a nuaber of
traces at Headquarters.

8. AMVHIP-1 also discuseed the contents of a letter
received from AMLASH-2. The essential part of this letter
plus a telephone call from AMLASH-3 froa Madrid was that
ANLASH-3 was somewhat upset by the fact that he was having
sifficulty im getting a visa for the U. 8, and/or the
Dominican Republic. AMWHIP-1 then spent considerable
time discussing the treatment of AMLASH-2 and AMLASH-3 in
Madrid by KEUBARK, He said he felt that AMLASH-2 and
ANLASH-3 ghouid be contacted by KUBARK and treated and
handled well. If this vere done, they would both serve &
very useful purposes for ZUBARK ends both ia Europe and in
Cuba. The undersigned told AMWHIP-1 that we essentially
agreed. vith his position and would take up the satter with
our superiors when we returned to Washington. Oa the
matter of the visa for AHLASH-3, we pointed out that wo
could mot intercede for AMLASH-3 in either case because it
would be compromising to him. To illustrate the point we
explained that both governzents knew that AMLASH-3 was a
Captain in the Rebel Army and had up uatil recently been
working active!y for a ministry of the Cuban Government
aud therefore considered a Cuban official working in behalf
of the Castro Government. As such AMLASH-3, or anyone in
that position, would not be entitled to enter either country
under normal circumstances. We pointed out that theCuban
Government. in all probability knew of this; and, if AMLASE-3

@ucceeded easily ia ontering either country, this would
be a rather obvious indication to the Cuban DSE that
AMLASH-3 eust be cooperating with one or the other govern-
@ent. AilsdiF-i accepted the explanation and felt it
would be readily understandable an’ a good excuse to give
to ANLASH-~3.

6, AMWHIP-1 also talked at length on the subject of
AMBIDDY-1 and AMLASH-1. He repeated hia previous position
that tho marriage of AMBIDDY-1 and AHLASH-1 would brood
no good, that aa unnecessary number of people now know of
AHLASH-1'g plans, and that AMLASH-1 himself was very
skeptical of the arrangement with AMBIDDY-1. Furthermore,
a8 @ resalt of this, he is somewhat unsure of his position
vis-a-vis OUYOKE,

7. AMWHIP-1 said he would advise us of his exact
date in the event we had any further instructions
for him, Tho meeting terminated at 1520 hours. There were
RO igcidenses of a security nature to report.
