Re marginally quoted

subject, your reference 92-162.

ENGLaNd

From sources knomn to this Department, it has been gleaned

Joseph Francisco Mario LANDINO arrived at Heathrow Airport, London

via New York on Friday, 12th December, 1975 on an Air India Flight.

He then an on the a teriage lot center, surge there he done

who LANDINO met during this three day stay but it is known that he 1

then flew out from Heathrow Airport at 1900 hours on a Swiss Air

flight bound for Zurich. He returned to the United Kingdom the

following day and apparently returned to the Cotteridge Hotel.

According to sources within the hotel, LANDINO was booked to return

to the United States on Wednesday, 17th December, 1975 and that at

about noon LANDINO ohecked out of

the hotel, apparently in something

of a hurry, stating to the hotel employees that he was leaving for

Heathrow Airport.

Nothing further can be traced at this stage as to

LANDINO's movements in this country.

Extensive enquiries have been

made in an effort to trace and identify the nature of the business

that LANDINO has been sent over to settle.

It must be emphasised that the following information is

supposition only and cannot be proved in any way.

FLA

â€¢: From the description given of the individual who drives a

Roils Royce and spends a great deal of time in France, it is of the

opinion that this could be a man called Judah BINSTOCk, the former

owner of the Victoria Sporting Club, who is reputedly a millionnaire

of Jewish background and a qualified

solicitor. BINSTOCK has been

involved in several business enterprises in France where he lives,

at 49 Avenue Foch, Paris 16. It is understood by this Department

that he has also been

to Miami on several occasions where he has many

associates, some possibly involved with the Miami Crime Syndicate.

Further, it is understood that BINSTOCK is a member of the Miami Turf

No loc

There are no criminal convictions recorded against BINSTOCK

but he is well known to this Department because of his suspected

association with members of organised crime syndicates, one of whom

is known to be the notorious DinolcallINI, who is undoubtedly already

well known to your Organised Crime Department in Washington. There

is no trace of BINSTOCK recently visiting the U.K. and efforts are

continuing to establish, if it is indeed BINSTOCK who is the man

involved, as to what business it was that caused LANDINO to be sent

to this country.
