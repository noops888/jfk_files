y On May 11, 1953, during an interview with JOHN LA ROCCA

in connection with an official matter, the subject of
the Mafia came up and LA ROCCA advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA
as follows: d

He denied current or past existence in the United States

of any organization known as the Black Hand or Mafia.

He said Sicilians who had come to the United States had
congregated in certain communities in the same fashion as

had Irish and other nationality groups, because of similarities
of ‘interests and backgrounds. These communities had-
naturally given rise to social, fraternal and civic groups
and members of such groups as a matter of course assisted
other members who were in ay sort of trouble. The tactics
used in some instances to achieve the ends desired by some

of these groups were not always according to the letter of the
law, but they were generally more effective. In any group
there are those who refuse to work for a living and sometimes
resort to extorting a livelihood from anyone who could be
frightened or terrorized. In an Italian community these

few would naturally be referred to as the Black Hand or

Mafia because of the history of similar activities on the

x part .of the Meats in Sicily. Baia ino

PG T-1, who has furnishedreliable information in the past,
advised on September 28, 1958, that prior to World War I
the Mafia, known as the "Black Hand" did actually exist

in the United States. (PG T-1 said that he personally knew
the "Black Hand" dealt with his father-in-law (deceased):

(for when the latter was living he told him that he had
received a letter from the "Black Hand" demanding money
with a threat to burn his store. He said that this was
in about 1930 or 31 and that his father-in-law operated
a small produce store. Further, that his father-in-law
paid the "Black Hand" over a period of years for
protection. PG T-1 said that his father-in-law never
mentioned names and that he, PG T-1, could not furnish
the identities of the "Black Hand" members who dealt
with his father-in-law.)

PG T-1 further advised that he learned from his father-
in-law )and other sources, names unrecalled, that the

"Black Hand" contacted Italians owning small stores ‘in
Monongahela, Pa., and vicinity and demanded "protection
money with the threat of bodily harm. Later, the "Black
Hand" members would deliver produce such as bananas,
cabbage, apples and the like to the Italian store owners
and even though the produce or fruit was spoiled, nor ordered
and of no value to the store owner, the owners were forced
to accept the produce. PG.T-1 added that the price of the
produce was extremely high; however, the small Italian
store owner always paid because he knew this was a practice
of the "Black Hand." PG T-lsaid that he did not know. of
any specific store owner who could verify the foregoing
information.

PG T-1 stat that it was his belief that TONY RIPEPI Fa
and DOMINICK¥4ANZALONE were members of the "Black Hand" at!
one-time-but"he said that he had no proof of this. PG T-1
based his opinion on the fact that both RIPEPI and

ANZALONE "gre big" after starting out as "bootleggers."

He said that he felt that neither RIPEPI nor ANZALONE

would have gained their present power in the rackets had they
not been members of the Mafia. PG T-1 further stated that

he could offer no additional sources to verify his. beliefs.

PG T-1 said that in the late 1920's and early 1930's he
recalled "talk" among the Italian- element, names unrecalled,
that JOE CANCELLIERE (deceased) who lived in Pittsburgh,
was the "head" of the Mafia and that JOHN LA ROCCA was _
high in this organization. He said that he had no proof of
this and could not furnish any source for his information.

which could pull strings from one point and control crime or
gambling in another section of the country. He said that in
spite of all these statements he knew that the FBI and other
governmental agencies would not believe him; however, there was
no way that he could prove his statements.

It is noted that JOHN LA ROCCA was recently interviewed by

SA ROBERT A. VOEGE regarding his connection with the MAFIA.
The results of this interview were reported previously in this
report.

GEORGE "MOON MESSER, a self-admitted Pittsburgh numbers writer,
124 Elysian treet, Pittsburgh, fy s interviewed by SA”ROBERT A.
JORGE on February ©7, 1958, regarditfig JOHN LA ROCCA. MESSER
said that LA ROCCA used to be in the numbers in the East Liberty
area along with him and on one occasion LA ROCCA went to
Chicago, I11., whereupon MESSER moved into the East Liberty
area and took over the entire numbers operation. When LANROCGA
returned from Chicago, he became angry with MESSER and had a

car run over him one night when he was crossing the street.

When MESSER got out of the hospital he said he found his
automobile had numerous bullet holes in it.

MESSER said that later he and LA ROCCA ended their feud and in
approximately 1943, LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in
the ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company,

5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh. MESSER advised that this
company did well financially until the Allegheny County
authorities raided the establishments where the coin machines
were located.

MESSER advised that in about 1947, labor leader wrofenrnoNe
¥VISitea the company office to talk to LA ROCCA and SAM MANNARINO.
STIRONE asked SAM MANNARINO to get some "gorillas" to handle

some men who were giving STIRONE labor trouble on a highway

being built in the Monroeville, Pa., section and more specifically
to give the dissenters a "going over" while upsetting their
equipment. MESSER said the job was done for STIRONE by

MANNARINO who became incensed when he learned his gorillas had
hurt some older Italian men. MESSER said MANNARINO was under

the impression that the men who had defied STIRONE were "young
Bunks ° and he let STIRONE know what he thought of him in front

of MESSER.
