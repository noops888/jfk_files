B. ORGANIZATIONAL SETUP AND LEADERSHIP

During general investigations into criminal type matters

and from general public sources, the name SEBASTIAN JOHN

LA ROCCA, commonly known as JOHNLA ROCCA, Of Pittsburgh,

has frequently been mentioned as synonomous with

. the

Pittsburgh area leader of the Marla. Huie

On May 11, 1953, during an interview with JOHN LA ROCCA

in connection with an official matter, the subject of

the Mafia came up and LA ROCCA advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA

as follows:

He denied current or past existence in the United States

of any organization known as the Black Hand or Mafia.

He said Sicilians who had come to the United States had

congregated in certain communities in the same fashion as

had Irish and other nationality groups, because of similarities

of interests and backgrounds.

These communities had

naturally given rise to social, fraternal and civic groups

and members of such groups as a matter of course assisted

other members who were in ay sort of trouble.

The tactics

used in some instances to achieve the ends desired by some

of these groups were not always according to the letter of

the

law, but they were generally more effective. In any group

there are those who refuse to work for a living and sometimes

resort to extorting a livelihood from anyone who could be

frightened or terrorized.

In an Italian community these

few would naturally be referred to as the Black Hand or

Mafia because of the history of similar activities on the

part of the Mafia in Sicily.

or hearsay.

PG I-I, who has furnishedreliable information in the past,

advised on september 28, "Black Hand"

in the United States. (PG I-I said that he personally knew

(for when the latter was living he told him that he had

received a letter from the "Black Hand" demanding money

with a threat to burn his store.

He said that this was

in about 1930 or 31 and that his father-in-law operated

a small produce store.

Further,

that his father-in-law

paid the "Black Hand"

over a period of years for

protection. PG T-l said that his father-in-law never

mentioned names and that he, PG I-1, could not furnish

the identities of the

"Black Hand"

members who dealt

with his father-in-law.)

PG T-l further advised that he learned from his father-

in-law and other sources, names unreca lea, that the

"Black Hand"

contacted Itallans owning small stores in

Monongahela, Pa., and vicinity and demanded "protection

with

the

threat of bodily narm.

Later, the "Black

members would deliver produce

such as bananas,

cabbage,

apples and the like to the Italian store owners

and even though the produce or fruit was spoiled, nor ordered

and of no value to the store owner, the owners were forced

to accept the produce.

IG 1-1 added that the price of the

produce was extremely high; 'however, the small Italian

store owner always paid because he knew this was a practice

of the

"Black Hand."

PG T-l said that he did not know. of

any specific store owner who could verify the foregoing

information.

PG T-l stated that it was his belief that TONY RIPEPI

based his

opinion

on the fact that both RIPEPI and

ANZALONE "gre big"

after starting out as "bootleggers."

He said that he felt that neither RIPEPI nor ANZALONE

would have gained their present power in the rackets had they

not been members of the Mafia. PG T-l further stated that

he could offer no additional sources to verify his beliers.

PG T-I said that in the late 1920's and early 1930's he

recalled "talk" among the Italian element, names unrecalled,

that JOE CANCELLIERE (deceased) who lived in Pittsburgh,

was the

"head" of the Mafia and that JOHN LA ROCCA waS

high in this organization.

He said that he had no proof' of

this and could not furnish any source for his information.

ROSA left the room

and about a week later GIANNI was shot to death.

TONY RIPEPI

on January 3, 1958, PGIT-liadvised that he has known TONY

RIPEPI for about 45 years and associated with him closely

until about 1950:

During a discussion of the GARROW-EVANS murder in Pittsburgh

in 1926, PG T-I commented that he did not have specific

information which would link TONY RIPEPI with the GARROW

EVANS murder but. commented that he did not want to discuss

this matter adding,

"If word gets back to TONY that I have

talked to you, he will have my place blown up, and that I

don't want."

On January 20, 1958, PG T-2, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised. that in about tys, toNy

RIPEPI, DOMINICK ANZATONE and CHARLES ZIMMARO of Monasse, Pa.

the latter an associate of RIPEPI, who was involved in the

numbers games, started nethe numbers business in a poolroom

believed to have been leased by ZIMMARO at Monessen.

The

informant said that ANZALONE and RIPEPI wanted him, informant,

to use his influence to secure control of the numbers operations

in Washington County, Pa,, which at that time were being

operated by HARRS MILLER"

of Donora, Pa.

PG T-2 said that he talked to TOM WHITE, who was then Chief

of Police in California, Pa., and also ROBERT COWELL, deceased,

who was then a Constable of around Roscoe, Pa., but that

individuals refused to allow ANZALONE and RIPEPI to operate

the numbers in Washington County. PG I-2 said that WHITE and

COWELL, told him that HARRY MILLER was treating them all right

and that they had no intention of permitting anyone else to

operate numbers in Washington County.

Informant. stated that

he told this to TONY RIPEPI and RIPEPI said something to the

Informant

explained that PROTON, who is deceased, worked for MILLER at

that time.

The informant said that after RIPEPI told him about "bumping

MILIER off" he decided he did not want any further association

with RIPEPI or ANZALONE and he gradually broke away from

this association.

He stated that to his knowledge, neither

RIPEPI nOr ANZALONE took any physical action against MILLER

or PROTON; however, RIPEPI and ANZALONE eventually gained

control of the numbers racket in Washington County, forcing

MILLER out.

During the investigation of TONY RIPEPI in 1958, the following

sources were specifically questioned for information which

they might have relating to the so-called Mafia, syndicate or

organized crime in which RIPEPI and ANZALONE were associated.

These sources said there was no indication that RIPEPI was

a member or connected with a state or nationwide syndicate

and that they never heard RIPEPI'S or ANZALONE's names

mentioned in connection with the Mafia:

which could pull strings from one point and control crime or

gambling in another section of the country.

He said that in

spite of all these statements he knew that

the FBI and other

governmental agencies would not believe him; however, there was

no way that he could prove his statements.

It is noted that JOHN LA ROCCA was recently interviewed by

SA ROBERT A. VOEGE regarding his connection with the MAFIA.

area and took over the entire numbers operation.

When LARROCCA

returned from Chicago, he became angry with MESSER and had a

car run over him one night when he was crossing the street.

When MESSER got out of the hospital he said he found his

automobile had numerous bullet holes in it.

MESSER said that later he and LA ROCCA ended their feud and in

approximately 1943, LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in

the ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing company,

5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh.

MESSER advised that this

company did well financially until the Allegheny County

authorities raided the establishments where the coin machines

were located.

NESSER advised that in about 1947, labor leader NICK STIRONE

visited the company office to talk to LA ROCCA and SAM MANNARINO.

STIRONE asked SAM MANNARINO to get some

"gorillas" to handle

some men who were giving STIRONE labor trouble on a hignway

being built in the Monroeville, Pa.,

section and more specifically

to give the dissenters a "going over" while upsetting their

equipment. MESSER said the job was done for STIRONE by

MANNARINO who became incensed when he learned his gorillas had

hurt some older Italian men. MESSER said MANNARINO was under

the impression that the men who had defied STIRONE were "young

punks "*

and he let STIRONE know what he thought of him in front

Of MESSER.
