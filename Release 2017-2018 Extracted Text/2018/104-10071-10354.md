RALKIN-and DAMJANOV, two close friénds from the Plovdiv area serving in
the same Trudovak unit in Beamer, decided to desert and escape to Turkey,
the néarést non-Commihist country.’ In Maich°1951 the ‘two Trudovaks were
‘transferred to a Trudovak wnit‘in Balcik, where they became friendly with
“another Trudovak, Stevan PELTEKOV. PELTEXOV wanted to escape to Greece.
ELTEKOV was’ sure that he could get the assistance of his father, Petur
PELTEKOV, a farmer in Branipole, and¥¥fasil LAZAROVS4his brother-in-lav,
«who was a non-commissioned officer in the 9 Infantry Regiment in Plovdiv.
Since RAIKIN and DAMJANOV were unable to organize a safe escape to Turkey,
they decided to join PELTEXOy in his flight to Greece. i
