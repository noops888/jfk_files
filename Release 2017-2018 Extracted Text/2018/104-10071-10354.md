Attached herewith is the combined explanation of subjects, activities

prior to their escape to Creece. The men were individually interrogated

by CASP and GASP/3 in order to get an organised report on their activities

It, should be noticed that there appear to be several illegal groups in

the montains around the Ploydiv area, including a so-called Gorjant

SUBJECT:

Escape of Seven Bulgarian Refugees

REPERENCE: PGA-A-5310; 5311; 5309; 4934

1..

The following seven Bulgarian refugees arrived in Greece 21 June I951:

*Petur NIKOLOV EL

*stevan PELTEKOVEL

Ivan NIKOLOV GL

*Peter PELTEKOV EL

*Zaravko DAMJANOV GL

X Boris PELTEKOVE

• E.

*Spas RATKINGA

20

After studying the Creek report and the report of our Kavalla sub station

(PGK-A-478), it was decided to interrogate all seven of the refugees

again individually with the help of GASP and GASP/8 to check their stories,

analyze their accusations, and to determine their operational possibilities.

3. To make the Story easier to understand, the seven persons may be divided

Ento three groups:

a. Three Trudovaks who wanted to escape to Greece: Stefan PELTEKOVS

Zoravko DANJANO, and. Spas RAIKIN:

Ivan NIKOLOV and Petur NiKOLOV, members of an alleged anti-Communist

group in the Plovdiv area which helped the Trudovaks to escape

Petur PELTEKOV and Boris PELICKOV, the father and uncle respectivelys

of Stevan PeLlENOV, who served as intermediaries between the Trudovaks

-and the anti-Communist organization in order to arrange the escape oi

the Trudovaks. They became so involved arranging the flight that they

had to flee themselves in order to avoid arrest.

RATKIN and DAMJANOV, two close friends from the Plovdiv area serving in

the same Trudovax unit in Bezmer, decided to desert and escape to Turkey,

the nearest non-Comminist country.

In March 1951 the two Trudovaks were

transferred to a Trudovak unit in Balcik, where they became friendly with

another Trudovak,

Stevan PELTEKOV. PELTEKOV wanted to escape to Greece.

Since RAIKIN and DAIJANOV were unable to organize a safe escape to Turkey,

they decided to join PELTINOV in his flight to Greece.

Since the minter of 1950 Stevan PELTEKOV had been urging his father to

help him to escape to Greece. Petur raurpkowthen approached vasal Izarov,

a non-comassioned oriccr whose vife iskaria PaLTOROW

According to statenents of retur and ivan NIECIOV, there is at least a

rudimentary anti-Corminist organization in existence in the Plovdiv area

Although LAZAROV stated that he had a guide available, he actually did

not have a guide at his disposal, nor did he have any personal contact

with the "Gorjani". He may have reported to the underground group that

the Trudovak deserters were to arrive- in Plovdiv. The underground organ-

ization may have decided that the three young men would be a valuable

adaition to their strength, especially since they had been comelled to

The underground organi-

Lation may not have been sure that the Trudovaks would be willing to join

the Gorjani instead of going to Greece, and they may have decided not to

say anything to

the Trudovaks or to Petur and Boris PELTEKOV, the father

kove van lodorgy Storayoys visited them and showed them how to overate

the weapons they had received. The same day the Trudovaks were taken by

Petar NIKOLOV to a place called Gole Mogila which is in the mountains about

twenty kilometers south of Markovo. Waiting for them there were Vasil

LAZAROV and his miter baria. Cola logila was supposed to be the final

hiding place until their departure to Greece.

Until his arrest, Ivan

NIKOLOV was providing the group with food.

Äfter NIKOLOV's arrest, the

group was given food; very irregularly, by Boris PELTEKOV.

Vasi LAZAROV and his wife tried all day 10 Nay to persuade the Trudovaks

to join the Gorjani becäuse there as no guide available to take them to

Greece.

The Irudovaks refused the susgestion emphatically and insisted

that they wanted to flee to greece only LAZARoV leit them with the

promise that he would find a way to organize the escape and that he and

his wife would join then.

12. For several days the Trudovaks were left at Gola logila without any

contact and without food.

They lost confidence in LAZAROV and decided

to go to larkovo and Plovdiv to find Stevan PELTlOVis father and uncle.

On Li May they met Boris PRuT tO! in flovaiv.

PELTEKOV told them to

return immediately to cola agila and he would bring them some food the

next day. The followins

then assumed the task of finding a guide to take the Trudovaks either to

Greece or to the forjani.

The Trudovaks remained at Cola Mogila until 7 June.

On 7 June Boris

PELTEKOV came and told them that they could hide in NIKOLOV's home for

a while. They then rent to Ivan NIKOLOVis home In Markovo and learned

there that Petur MIKCLov had been arrested on 5 June, and that vasil

LAZAROV had betrayed al1 of them. Stevan PELTEKOV and Spas RAIKIN

returned immediately to cola logila, while Zdrarko DAlJANOV went to

Branipole to alert Petur and Boris PELTEKOV.
