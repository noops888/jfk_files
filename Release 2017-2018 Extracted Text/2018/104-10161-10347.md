CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

Western Hemisphere Division/Personnel has indicated that they

can delay their Career Agent certification to the field for no

more than one week. In view of the essentially favorable character

of all investigative efforts into Subject's background and activi-

ties,

it is recommended that Subject's conversion to Career Agent

status be approved contingent upon the completion of a favorable

technical interrogation.

Limited National Agency checks and

Police checks in the Miami area will be completed on a backstop

basis.
