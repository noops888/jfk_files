Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent

variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Aginey,

Agency affiliation

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING clained such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug

Enforcement Administration.

the late 1950's HENNING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Conmunist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this

HEMMING,

you are referred to attachments to instant

a memorandum by

the writer

dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT,

and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'etat

in Anerica--The CIA and the Assassination of John F

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the najor

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugone

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.
