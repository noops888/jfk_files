NOTE: The also included
information the had received

had been providing information on ZIMERI to the
Guatemalan government for the past six months or
so. He claimed that two Americans were involved
with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service
in Miami. «3° | did not mention names but
described one of the-Americans as about six feet
four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4. The Guatemalan report of i i plot ends
with five requests for information
a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United
States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala?

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-
tial treatment by U. S. authorities which
permit him to carry firearms, as well as
to purchase arms and ammunition for

Nepartment.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick ITN

8. Gerald Patrick IIENMING is well known to this Ag:
the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JNWAVE
fwevlis UCUsIONS Siac. OL least the early 1368's, HE
ind claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has b
none. The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his serv
to the Drug Enforcement: Administration. Gerald Patrick HfMMING
is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#3535 459),
aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Communist. Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr
and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written hy
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John Kenneay
‘Ys a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to 1 the Agency
with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA, GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
