FROM : Chief, Research Branch/os/sRs

SUBJECT: PAINE, Ruth

nee:

HYDE

aka:

Mrs. Michael PAINE

DATE: 5 December 1963

1. Mr. Cregar, FBI, on 4 December 1963 confirmed that the Subject

is the daughter of William Avery HYDE, SSD-157435. Cregar was furnished

a copy of two 1957 investigative reports on William HYDE for lead purposes

only and was informed that William HYDE was under consideration for a

covert use by this Agency in Viet Nam in 1957 but was not used. (This

information had previously been obtained from

CI/SIG) â€¢

2. Subject is the individual who is taking care of the widow of

Tee Harvey Oswald and has apparently been quite well known to the widow

of Lee Harvey Oswald and possibly Lee Harvey Oswald for an undetermined

period of time. The possibility that William Avery HYDf was the father

of Ruth PAINE was previously brought to the attention of Mr. Papich

through Mr. O 'Neal, CI/SIG. The Security File of William HYDE contains

a copy of a 1956 FBI Investigative Report (SECURITY OF GOVERNMHNT EMPLOYEES)

on Sylvia Iudlow HOKE, aka: Mrs. John I. HOKE, nee: Sylvia Ludlow HYDE, who

is the sister of Ruth PAINE. The file of William HYDE also contains a 1956

OSI report on Sylvia HOKE.

3. In addition to the above, it was previously known that William

Avery HYDE and wife Carol HYDE were associates in the late 1920's and

later of Talbot BIFLEFELT, #29931, who is currently employed by this

Agency in FDD. A certain amount of information concerning William HYDE,

Carol HYDE, and other associates of HYDE and BIFLEFHIT during the latter

1920's was furnished by Talbot BIELLELT during interviews several years

ago.

At that time the BIFLEFELT Case was under extensive investigation.
