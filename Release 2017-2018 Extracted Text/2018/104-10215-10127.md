about it. If it's no, then no. I'11 manage very well. I have
‘two very good beds." ((Apparently C. and D. are departing soon.))

between 0200 = 0945 hours. During. Subject's entire stay ‘in Mexico,
he wos seen most often in the company of Subject of 201-261813,
Per AEMIDRIFF information, coupled with information available in
Btation files, it is believed that Subject of 201-261813 possibly
functions. as one of the Deputy Rezidents of the AEGRIP Residentura
in Mexico City. It ia probable that Subject of 201-261813 was the

Mexico City AEGRIP cago officer in this particular case, Subject's

“other contacts were Subjects of. 201-850177 and 201-844588, both
identified by AEMIDRIFF as AEGRIP officers, and possibly could have
boon involved in the case as support officers. Subject was also
in. contact with Subject ‘of 201-814235, who is an. AEGRIP officer,

3. Subject was not seen‘at the Soviet Embassy on 14 March,
which was the originally echeduled meeting date with the LNEASE
agont. On Sunday, 15 March, LILYRIC reported that Subject entered
the Soviet Embassy at 1143 hours and was seen leaving, alone, at

32 hours. There was no LIEMPTY source coverage on 28 March 1970,
which was supposed to be the alteraate meeting date with the agent,

a snag, however, in the wake of the AcMIDRIFF defection, and
pessibly also due to the operation. against AESHASICK: ; In most
cases, our MHHARSH friends have suddenly hecome: inaccessible.

There wore three functions of. the Consular Corps, including the
annual election of officers, within about two weeks of AGMIDRIFF's’
defection and subsequent Press conference (which. took some cracks
at the members of the MHHARSH consular section, indicating that.
they spent 90 percent of their time, doing intelligence work and
very little time issuing visas). The MMJIARSH representation in the
Consular Corps Association had always been a Strong one, and one of
their- people was oormally an officer (formerly AEDIEHARD, more
recently 201-305870). However, none of them attended any of these -
functions, including the elections,. 20) 05870, a consular officer,
bad ah invitation to the. home of Dexter XOSTEDT on 13.March,

Not only did he not show up, ROSTEDT was never able to get hima _
the phone to confirm’ the invitation: A January volleyball match
between the MHHARSH mbassy and LNPURE was supposed to have been
followed by return engagements, 201-305870 was in charge of’ this,
and he has suddenly. lost interest in the follow-up. ‘On the other
hand, the MHHARSHers who belong to ALCOSAD have behaved more normally,
AEJALISCO, the MHHARSH representative on the ANCOSAD board of
directors, took part. in an excursion to Baja California: 28 February
(no LNPUHE.orticers went) and was present with a half-dozen of his

ay colleagues at the AMCOSAD annual election lunch on 19 March,

(At. the 19 March affair, AEJALISCO was uncharacteristically nervous,

:but would not say what was bothering him, It will be‘ noted that

“the: AESEASICK operation reached its denouement the night before.)

3. In support of the evidence above that the MRHARSHers. have
Bone into their shell; at least to sone extent, as a result of.
AEMIDRIFF's defection, LIBACON=-1 has reported that a TDY technician
with whom he bad been working as a translator, told him that it
Was .now much more difficult to get away to go out. on the town with

.LIBACON-1. When asked why, he said it:was due to AEMIDRIFF, "who

really s--- on us, even we [TDYers} are being watched." In general, ;
the line given out by MHHARSHers.asked about AEMIDRIFF's defection
sticks to the story that. she was just.a dumb secretary. who fell

in love with a Mexican. She aot only knows nothing, she will
probably be very sorry she ever had anything to do with that Latin
Lover... i . + :

4 It. is probable that the. MHHARSHers will. slowly come out
of their shells and will begin to circulate once more, If 60, the
Station's policy of supplementing the SB operational program with
personal contacts will continue, and, as stated, will concentrate
on obtaining this type of contact with the selected targets. In
this way, our ismeat and knowledge of the target can be supplement-
ed by a case officer's expert assessment, Headquarters will be
kept advised of developments.

5. This dispatch was in preparation. when Reference B arrived.
The assessuents of AEJALISCO and 201-305870, requested in Reference
B, are included in the attachment. PCQs have been filled out in
ain instances, and a batch on AEJALISCO will be forwarded
shortly, The Spanish-language PCQ's-promised in Reference B will

SUBJECT; Vincent P, RIZZUTO's Soviet Contacts

Largely through the medium of AMCOSAD, RIZZUT) has met a
number of Soviets, With many it is little more than a nodding
acquaintance, but with some it is a little deeper than that.
The latter are discussed below, It should be pointed out, that each
of these Soviets is very likely aware of .RIZZUTO’S RVROCK ‘affiliation.

falentin KULIN (201-2018 - RIZZUTO has known
shim for over two years. BAKULIN is a smooth-talking, smooth~appearing
‘diplomat. He speaks excellent Spanish, but has never been known to

“talk about anything more controversial than the weather, the landscape,

or his family. His wife is a pleasant woman, but she rarely
accompanies him on excursions. He has.a teen-aged son of whom. he
is very proud. -The son visited him in the summer of 1969, and the
gon exhibited a pretty. good working knowledge of. English, which he
had been stu:lying in school in Moscow, BAKULIN appears to be a
bit of a hypochondriac, He complains often of stomach ailments,
and for this reason rarely takes a. drink (at least. in public)

In spite of his good Spanish and his very presentable appearance,
be does not seem to mix much with non-Soviets, In common with
most ofhis colleagues (notably excepting Boris A. CHMYKIOV and

“sBoris A. KAZANTSEV), BAKULIN seems to prefer the company of his

“own people, and does not go out of his way to talk to others.

“When he is approached, he is very aftable. He never talks about his
job (he is one of the First Secretaries but does not appear to have
‘any overt job), but did say once that he and CHMYKHOV could not go
on home leave at the same time because one had to cover for .the
other. AMCOSAD functions appear to provide theonly occasion for

‘ BAKULIN to appear in public, When‘RIZZUTO has been to functions at

the Soviet Pnbassy, BAKULIN has always been’ the proper host -- polite
and hospitable, The real BAKULIN never shows through. Since he is
a neighbor (same floor of same apartment building) as well as
frequent companion of CHMYKHOV, he is undoubtedly aware of the
relationship between RIZZUTO and CHMYKNOV, and he stays out of it,
probably on purpese.

B. Yuriy CHERNYSH (201-825743) - RIZZUTO has met CHFERRYSH
only three times, the firs two meetings being well over a year apart.
However, oll meetings resulted in relatively lengthy ccnversations,
CHEPNYSH uade.no bones about getting, RIZZUTO's name correctly
(most Soviets do not seem to bother and usually act as if they do
not remember the name). . He will talk, intelligently, about almost
any topic, controversial or not. He is very intense, as if he is
working hard to remember everything that was said, and every quirk

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT - 8 BESABER (P-8777)
DAT@ OF MEETING : 27 February 1969

~1. In response to a phone call from Subject, I met
him. from 1515 to 1545 qt his hotel. ;
2, Subject told me that he's on. the verge of bankruptcy
and that this time He's not kidding. He has been unable to

pay his employees their full wages and, recently, the news-
papers have begun attacking him as a foreigner, exploiter

of workers, etc, He seemed exceptionally cheery in spite of
the gloomy prospects and I indicated that I feel sure He'll
figure a way out of his problems, His one possibility is to

“get the money he needs from "Baby but the price is too
high: him. "Baby" would like Subject’to divorce his wife
which he refuses to do, :

3. ‘The main thing on Subject'ts mind was that he had
a visit from Valentin BAKULIN (P- G OS ) on Saturday,

22 February, at the factory. BAKULIN brought Subject a
bottle of vodka and he bought about $600 (pesos) worth of
“Subject's products to send back to the USSR. He apparently

_ sent some previously and. he said they went. over so well
“7: that “he wanted more. BAKULIN came with his wifé and. with :
: another Soviet couple but Subject didn't -know their names.

BAKULIN said he's going to. send Subject, sone little wooden

2)
so he wrote his name ae on a.scrap of paper for i
Subject which Subject’ would like to have returned.
a Xeroxed for BAKULIN's and Subject's file.
ve Subjegt gave me a letter he had’ Just received from
: Wlodzimiers STRZYZEW2KT, the mysterious Polish phocographer
who had turned up unexpectedly at Subject's house (see
Contact report of 22 Océ (FF ), Enclosed were a couple
: of photos hetd taken of Subject and his family, Subject
couldn't understand why the quality. 4s so bad considering
that STR was passing himself off as a professional photog
and was loaded with equipment. Also interesting is the
fact that the letter arrived very soon after the visit of

OF Ny.

groused about never having received a letter or the photos
the STR had promised. Subject is sure that MAJ must have
sent a telegram to Poland telling STR to get on the stick.

i

P.S, I told Subject to direct ‘his attention toward BEPAR
(P-6601) as soon as possible. I suggested that he might

* arrange to be. introduced through MAJ on the. pretext “Subject

had mentioned once before, i.e., Subject's interest in seeing
some of Subject's grandfather's music presented in Mexico.
He thought this sounded pretty reasonable in view of the

rapport he now has with MAJ while having no other natural
entree to BEPAN.
