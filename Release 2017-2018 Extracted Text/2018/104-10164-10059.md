What kind of communications? where located?

DAVIS has no detailed information on it, but

said 1f Frank BARfeS fives the word, they would go into action against CASTRO.

This certainly looks like a built-in railroed disruption capability, because

1I BARIES hes Iollowers anywherc, it would be on the RR system. Also, the

BARTES fanily name would seem to have political and propaganda value. I

asked 1f there is any BATISTA tie-up and DAVIS said emphatically no. He
