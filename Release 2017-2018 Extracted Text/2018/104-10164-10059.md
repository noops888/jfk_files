-Gays BARYES' goal is an anti-Communist regime in Cuba.

SECRET
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/l/PM 1k July 1960
SUBJECT: Frencisco (Frank) }» Wealthy Cuban

with RR, Sugar and Ride Holdings iiss

1, I interviewed William C. DAVIS, now of ICA and former employee ‘
of Subject, regarding BARFES. Attached are 00 and CI reports of inter-
views with DAVIS.

2. In talking to DAVIS, I stressed the subject of “organization” ~ .
how many in it? How organized? What kind of communications? Where located?
What is their motivation? DAVIS has no detailed information on it, but i
said if Frank gives the word, they would go into action against CASTRO. f
This certainly looks like a built-in railrosd disruption capability, because | i
if BARWES hes followers anyvherc, it vould be on the RR system. Also, the : *
BAMFES femily name would seem to have political and propagende value. I
asked if there is eny BATISTA tie-up and DAVIS said emphatically no. He

3. he arranged plan is for DAVIS’ wife to call BARFES (if there is : E
U.6. interest) and say DAVIS is sick. BARGES will then come to Beaumont, :

Texas, the first part of August for 2 days only and meet DAVIS there.

4, Would like to discuss further with you. This looks like e good,
Possibility of developing a capability in Comaguey and Oriente where we
need it badly. Communications either by radio and/or 5W appear possible.
