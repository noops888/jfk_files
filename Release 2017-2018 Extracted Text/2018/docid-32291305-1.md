ALBERT A. FISHER, PCI, advised that JOHN ROMANO,

aka JACK ROMANO is remodeling a

building at 295 Sunny Isle

Blva., Dade County, Fla., which he plans to operate as a

bar and "dime a dance" establishment. He learned that

ROMANO also plans to operate a local tour agency, called the

"Sunny Isle Tours" out of this address and will, in addition,

solicit customers for a South American Tour, and when

sufficient customers are obtained, ROMANO plans to lease

an ocean going vessel and supply the gambling equipment and

girls for the tour. This source understands this location

reportedly is to be a contact point for "bust out" crap games

and headquarters for a female escort service. In addition

the source noted ROMANO has had some conferences with FRANK

DIOGUARDI (MM, 92-405) and JOE MILSTEIN, a snylock, at 295

Sunny, Isle ROMANO commented that they were around to collect

the rent, and that he, ROMANO, has to account to DIOGUARDI

and MILSTEIN on expenditures made in conjunction with this

place.
