In late September 1964 Antonie Carrillo Carreras, Cuban
Ambassador to'France, made the following comments about
succession ta Fidel Castro Ruz, and the personalities: who
are curreatly the most powerful political figures in Cuba:

a. In the event cf the disappearance of Fidel Castro from
the scene, particulariy through assassination, Rafl
Castro Ruz will take over inmediately as leader in
accordance with an established plan. Raul has the
support cf the army as well as that of other top Cuban
leaders in Fidel's imsediate group.

b. In terms of authority, after Fidel and Raul, President
valdo Dorticds Torrado and Industries Minister Ernesto
Che" Guevara Serna fcllow in that order. Dorticos, who
is widely respecte! in Cuba, now has specific responsibility
for guiding the econ . Guevara, in spite of ‘his foreign
birth, has pepular support and is generally considered a
Cuban. Cuevara has not failed as Minister of Industries,
The difficule functicning of the economy is attributable
simply to the fact, that many key industries continue to
use Arerican equipment for which replacement parts cannot
be acquired. Newer plants generally use Soviet and Czech
equipment aad they are now producing efficiently.
