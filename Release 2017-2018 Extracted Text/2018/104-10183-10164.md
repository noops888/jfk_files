SOURCE: . Cuban businessman in exile who travels abroad frequently and has

good access to Cuban diplomatic installations.

His reporting has

been limited.

In late September 1954 Antonio Carrillo Carreras, Cuban

Ambassador to France, made the following comments about

suscession to Fidel Casiro Ruz, and the personalities who

are currently the most powerful political figures in Cuba:

a. In the event of the disappearance of Fidel Castro from

the scene, particularly through assassination, Raúl

CIStrO Ruz

will take over irmediately as leader in

accordance with an established plan.

Raul has the

support of the aruy as well as that of other top Cuban

leaders in Fidel's imediate group.

b.

In cerns of authority, after Fidel and Raul, President

Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado

and Industrles Minister Ernesto

"Che" Guevara Serna feilow in that order.

Dorticos, who

1s widely respocked in Cuba, now has specific responsibility

for guiding che econis.

Guevara, in spite of his foreign

birth, has popula: support and is generally considered a

Cuban.

Cuevars has nir failed as Minister of Industries.

The difflcult functirning of the economy is atcributable

simply to the fact, that many key industries continue to

use Ameriran equiprent for which replacement parts cannot

be acquired.

Newer piants generally use Sovlet and Czech

equipmont rod thoy are now

producing efficiently.
