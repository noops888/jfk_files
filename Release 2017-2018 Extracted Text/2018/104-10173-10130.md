At the recent request of the Deputy Director for

its records to determine if we could find any payment to

Mr: Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required

no accounting.

2. We have searched the following records:

determined that $33,500 vas

advanced to him

for travel and transportation of household

soods to and from Madrid with one trip to

Paris for he and his family to renew their

Spanish visas.

All of this

advance was fully

accounted for.

However,

in his accounting,

one item appeared unusual.

It was

an

expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive

operation which was approved for write-off by Mr.

Desmond Fitzgerald on l June 1966 without

further accounting.

Also;

we confirmed that no other Agency advance accourts

were established for Mr. Hunt during this period.

. 4.

At the beginning of his non-official cover toughe

it

was necessary to establish a bank account in his name.

EUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the

Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr.

Hunt's name to receive all non-

salary payments.

(MT. Hunt had an account at Riggs National

Bank to receive

his

salary and allovance payments).

following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and

1966:

Account opened: 13 July 1965

We feel at this time without specific guidelines that

further searching would be somewhat fruitless!

One strange

aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that

all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the

EUK Division which is not normal as non-official cover people

arc usually assigned to a project.

It is unusual to have a

case officer abroad for one year on an operational assigment

without him incurring operational capenditures.

The Offico of Finance has not found operational

expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.

Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karamessings be questioned

as to a project of projects to which Nr. Hunt's operational

expenditures if incurred would have been charged.

7. Another possiblo course of action is to request the

Director to approve my

asking

at Chase

MEMORANDUN FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

1. I spoke with Fig Coleman about Hunt's assignment to Spain.

I hnd spoken with him back in August when we were inquiring into

roported activities involving Mrs. Hunt

Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964

(by which he fixed the time), and took over the Iberian desk.

BIll

Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn

Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamegaines)

that Hunt was to be assigned to

as DCOS, as a dirccted assign-

ment by Helms. A mémo was prepared and sent to the COS,

(now rotired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan

called Colemar in and showed him a RYBAT letter from

stating

that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the

Embasay.

3. - Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt

was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting

the days until Hunt left. The President of Uruguay visited President

Eisenhower in the States,

at which time he requested a personal favor.

that Hunt be reassigned to Montevideo. - So Hunt took another tour.

Woodward was outraged, and had his revenge in 1964 when Hunt was

to be sent as DCOS to

4. After a couple of months--early 1965--Ryán called Coleman

in and, observing that there was more than one way to skin a cat,

told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover. This

didn't require anything special. Ryan saying thät he didn't know

much about it. It canie to him from Karamessines on Helms' order.

Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do

nothing for the station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers

for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman

said he nover saw Hunt before he went oul. He knows that there was

no operational reporting, to indicale that Hunt was doing anything.

SOLRDEMTAL

The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was poor.

Coleman raised the question with Ryan about his signing off, and

Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines if he wished. Because

Coleman had a close personal association with Karamessines he

did Just that. He was told by karamessines that he didn't krow much

about it either--"Helms said send him out," He was instructed to go

In carly. July 1966 (4 July) Coloran went to Madrid. He

had a ten day turnover ivith

Hunt had already gone and

he did not see him. L

said he didn't know what Hunt did, but

that Coloman need not worry because ho was gone.

Sevoral months ago

was at a seminar at which

Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked

about Hunt.

Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.

Tad Szulc had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to

Spain. Coleman observed that Szule did have a long article on Hunt

in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,

but without any conclusions as to its significance:

the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.

During the perio

of Mr. Hunt's assignment as a Contract deble A arent

to Madrid between July 1965 and September 1966, Mr.

Ryan had been the Deputy Chief of the Western European

Division, Deputy Director for Plans.

The purpose of

the intervior was to determine if Mr. Ryan had any

infornation bearing on the matter of the operational

assignment of Mr. Hust during this period.

2.

Mr.

Ryan. stated that the assignment of Mr.

Hunt both to the European Division and to. Madrid was

handled without benefit of the routine processing

procedures through the Western European Division.

Mr. Hunt's assignment was coordinated and directed

by Nt. Thomas Karamessines, the Assistant Deputy Director

for Plans..

With regard to operational duties, Mr. Ryan

was unavare of any

specific project or target

for Mr.

Hunt..

Ni. Ryan made the specific observation that if

Mr. Hunt produced positive intelligence on the Iberian

target during this period the officials responsible

for this effort within.

the Western European Division

were totally unavare.of it.

Mr. Ryan stated that most of his knowledge of

Mr. Hunt's activity and the nature of his assiunnent

during this period came more. through hearsay than

for example, he cited the

conment nade by a mutual acquaintance of his and Mr.

Hunt's to the effoct that Nr.. Hunt stated that while

in Nadrid he was going to "play golf and krite books."

Ryan was asked specifically whether or not he was

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern

1. I mei with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning

in GGl0; where he is cleaning up some details before he goes to

his new assignment as DC/DCD.: I told him generally about our

attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial

transactions, and asked him particularly.for recollections he may

have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.

•2. Halpern said that he has no recollection about such an

assigament. In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des

FitzGerald when he became the DD/P.: At about that time

Halpern's father died and he was in New. York for the funeral

and ten days of religious observations following that." He was back

in mid-June and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend

the National War College which began in August.. He did not return

to, that office until the end of June 1966.

Halpern observed that daring this period Karamessines

was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely

possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this

on their own.

Halpern said that Evan Parker had come into the office

of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned

from Honolulu for that purpose. He stajed on for FitzGerald until

Halpern returned from the National War College. He suggested

someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something

abau: it (although ha may not). He aiso suggested talking to Georgia.

I n

response to 1

specific quescion, Mr.. O'Malley stated that during the

period of his contact with the Nullen Company dealing

with

the Free Cuba Committee, Mr. Jullen told hiin the

Howard Hughes Organization was a client of the concern.

3.

No. O'Malley reiterated his

previous statements

that Mr. Hunt was referred to his office for placement

assistance through the Office of the Executive Director,

then Colonel L. K. White.

with Mr. Robert Mullen for the purpose of gaining the

benefit of Mr..

Mullen's guidance.

Mr. O'Malley rocalled,

after the initial meeting, Mr. Mullen mencioned having

met Mr. Hunt some ycars previousl) in Paris, France.

Nr. O'Malley's office arranged interviers with various

organizations including Reader's Digest and the Kennecott

Through the offices of the Mullen Company

an intervier was arranged with the General Foods Corpora-

as to whather or not executive level interest was. still

being

shown in Mr. Hunt's post-employnent placement,

Mr. O'Malley recalled roferring various

Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-

viduals expressed an interest in entering the public

relations field.

•Ne. ONalloy did recall disappointment

in feeling Mr. Hunt had generally been less helpful on

these occasions.

5.

Mr. Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several occasions:

requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with

specific qualifications.

These instances occurred apparent

ly after Hir. Hunt had assuned his responsibilities with

the White House.

instance Mr. Hunt requested re-

ferral of a recently retired Agency secretary..

previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Nailey Nas unable

to recall the name of this individual.

lle did, however,

state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turned down the

individual whom he referred. As a point of clarification,

Lit. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously

been known

to. Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked

for him in any capacity. Mi. O'Malley also recalled a

request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having skilis in

the area of locks and surreptitious entry.

A resume of

Mr. Thomas C. Amaco was provided to Mr. Hunt at that tine.

It is HI. O'Malley's recollection that Mr. Hunt specifically

stated that a person with Mr. Amato's qualifications was

nceded in connection with a requirement of the Howard

Hughes Organization in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. O'Malley

stated the opinion that it was his impression that the

duties involved.rould include the monitoring of a listening

device in an undisclosed location.

Nr.. O'Malley reiterated

his understanding that Mr. Anato did not accept Me. Hunt's

offer of employment.

Mr. C'Malley then recalled request from ir. Hunt

for a roconmendation of a security service

Nr. O'Malley

then suggested the use of Anderson Securits Consultants.

Mr. O Mallcy stated that insofar as this:

pages and that

Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the ser

vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion.

hir.

O'vallej stated that during a subsequent phone call when

Ar. Hurt responded,

At this point Nr. O'Malley was asked whether or not from

his associations with Mr. Hunt he folt Mr. Hunt was in

the habit of making glib connents which were not neces-

sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr.

O'Nalley stated that this was catogorically so.

He

said

he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied

to his on a number of

occasions and that, therefore, he was in no position to .

be sure that Mr. lunt had actually, in face, used

the

services of Anderson Security Consultants.

Mr. O'Malley

volunteered the opinion that he suspected the electronic

counterneasures "sweep" was to be carried out in the offices

of the Committce to Re-elect the President.

In response to a question as to whother le had

over referred anyone to McCord Associates, Mr. O dalley

replied that he remembered having roferred Walter Brayden.

Brayden for a time acted as bodygüard to Mrs. Martha

Mitchell.

As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned

that Mr.

Brayden had refused to carry a fircaim in spite of the :

fact that Mr.

NcCord told hin he could do so on the author-

ity of the Attorney General.

Asked specifically if he had

ever referred either Willian Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.

McCord, Mir..

O'Malley stated that he did not recall specif-

ically referring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he

had not referred William Shea to hin.

So, contrary to

previous statements, it is now Mr. O'Nalley's belief that

in all probability Mrs. Shoa was not referred by this

Agency to tir. McCord:

or not the funding of

Mr. Hunt's projecis continued beeroen

-July 1955 and Septembor 1055 while Mr. Hunt was a contract

Spain.

Mr. O'Malley recalled

Mr. O'Mallcy stated that

this was not generally

Mr. O'Malley was quite

certain that during this period his office handled no

project funding for Mr. Hunt.

In response to specific

question Mr. O'Malley stated that on Mr. Hunt's recurn

to

staff employment the projects and funding which stopped in

July: 1965 were again resumed. Mr. O'Malley was nöt aware

of any project names or funding nechanisms or post-assignment

and the uncorsigned.

Tho contract and payroll

of tho nature of the operational activlly undertaken in

Madrid.

A revlew of travel vouchers indicated chat Mr.

Hunt and his family made accountings indicating departure

from Washington, D. C

on 5 August 1965 with un arrival

In Madrid, Spain, on- 16 August 1965.

The costs of this

travel were charged to the budgar of the Western Hesi

sphere Division, Ceputy Directorate for Plans,

Station Support account. A subsequent accounting su

marizod PCS travel expenses and included a payment for

apartment tental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with

payment in the amount of $125 to Mr.

this purpose.

It was determined that an allottee bank account

in Me. Hunt's name had been ostablished

at the Riggs

An operational account

was established for Mr. Hunt with the Chase Manhattan

Bank of New York City.

A review of ail paymants made to

Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account through Mr. Hunt's

oporational advanco subsidiary account, or 1442 account,

had been made.

fir. Yals statod that this fact defined his concern.

He

felt that

It was inconceivable that Mr. Hunt could have

undortion oparational activity without some transfer of

To date, no such records have

been devoloped.

No referenco to a project or project:

Interviow with Mr. Raymond A. Rocca

on the David St. John Novels

On the morning of l4 February 1974 Nessrs.

Frederic: Evans and

Lawrence Howe Interviewed Mr. Raymond

A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operationg.

The purpose of the intervier was to follo up on infor

nacion contained in Office of Security files which stated

the bellef that individuals in the Counter Intolligence

Operationg office had knowledge of the writing acrivitios

of Mi. E. Howard Hunt.

This belief was a mattor of record

in the files of the

former Security Research Staff and was

accributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now rotired, and Mr. Edward

Sayla.

2 .

During this interview Mr. Rocca was specifically

askad whather or not he had knowledge of the existence of

any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.

E. Howard Hunt to writo novals to improve tho imago of

this Agency. Additionally, Mr. Rocca was asked whether

or not any assistarce was ever requested of the Counter

Intelligence Operstions offico to be provided to Mr. Hunt

or whether or not that staff had ever had any relationship

with Mr. Hunt whatsoever

In response to theso questions

N=. Rocca rosponded "on the record!' that he has no howledge

of any such arrangaments nor at any time has he party to any

assistance of any requests for assistance to Mr. Hunt. : Mr.

Rocca stated that the parcicular section which he had been

nost acclvoly concerned in the past yoars was responsible

for handling a variety of tasks' categorized under the area

of "sotting the record straight."

In this sense,

the "inage"

nission of the offica was to countor misinformation: cur-

rencly

in the media or othervise believed to be part of an

effort to discredit

the Agency

Nr. Rocca fools that any

assumption that Nr. Hunt was engaged in any form of Agoncy

sponsored

inags activity would have probably load to the

conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intolligence

Cperations. • However, Nr. Rocca emphatically stated that

Chis was not the

case.

Mr. Roces was thoroughly candld and cooporative

any official Agency

cxist: Nr. Rocca did venture tha opinion that he felt

that in all probability an official acquiascence on the

part of senior officials might have been involved rather

than an official sponsorship. It vas agroed by all in

this discussion that tha nature of any informal support

given to. Mr. Hunt would be far more difficult to define

in the absence of say fornalized agreements.

that aftor making the

Mr. Pforzheimer went on to relate that ho was

occasionally tasked to

SUBJSCT: General Gaynot's Recollections

1. This date, at your instruction, I called Gen. Paul F. Gaynor

to seek his recollections regarding his knowledge of the writings of

Mr. Hunt and any official who might be aware of the circumstances

of any Agency involvement in that effost.

2. Gen. Gajnor advised that his memory is not altogether clear

on the matter, and that he was "reaching," but stated that has he

reconstructs the matter:

He became aware that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplishing

a steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-

quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers.. (He stated.

triat this actirily Continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and

agreed with idea that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate

that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing. ) Gen. Gajnor advised

that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions. . The icaction

he recieved to his raising the issue was that "leop your stinking nose out

of this business." He stated that he was lead to balieve that Mir. Helms

desized to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agency

and that Hua!'s books were a part of the program to du so.

He stated that:

he was never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he

recieved lead him to believe this was the case.

b. He suggested that tvo people might be able to assist in clearing

the issue, Ray Rocca and Walter Piorzheimer, both of whom were involved

in the "image" maierials.

He stated that Piorzheimer seemed to be aware

of all the details i on an up to dete básis - of Tuat's departure from the

Agerics to join the public relations firm, to the degree that Gen. Gajnor

gained the belte! that Hunt was merely moving his desk outside the building,

but being pair by the same source as before.

He also advised that he kept

Miss Ethel Mendosa fairly curreni on what he was learning about Hunt's

actirities because she folloived the case for him, and suggested that her

recall about what he had learned and when and what resulted, might be

batter than his at this date. (Hel also mentioned an incident in which worsc

illen while on a TDY was told by a COS to ask Headquarters to remove Hunt

from the Area because of his direct liaison with the presi?ont of the coutery.

He also siggested that another person--definitaly no friend of

Hunt--who might have some sceall or have picked up information about

the book writing matter might be Anita Potocki of Cl Staft, formerly of

MEMORANDUM •FOR: Chief, Contract Personnel Division

SUBJECT:

Terence S. GRABANAC - Retention of

Royalties by a Contract Employee

1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to

the retention of future royalties which might be carned by Terence S.

CRABANAC as a result of his literary etorts. We believe that he is

entitled to retain such royalties withous an offset egainst his Agency

salary.

We have been advised by Mr. Gee Stevens, WI/Support, that

CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC'S

cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Forcign Service

Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated & July 1965 may

remain as written.

Royalties from the fictional works, that he writes as

a profitable hobby will not be emoluments reccived from or through his

"cover activities."
