by Bishop Boja Masvidal who has a genuine

Cuban revolutionary background), recapturing

the ideal of Marti by taking use of his memory

songs by commercial recordings. (USIA and

bak to mount.

while on the air. They need identifying music

Tby guerrilla instruments such as guitar or

harmonica), identifying alogan, and a formal

worth risk to the listener inside Cuba.
