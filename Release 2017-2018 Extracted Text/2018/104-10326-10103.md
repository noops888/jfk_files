NTACT BETWEEN A U.S. CITIZEN AND SEVERAL.
TAINLY EXPECTED THEIR REMARKS TO REACH

(PHIS REPORT RESULTS FROM ¢
CUBAN OFFICIALS WHO MOST CE
U.S. OFFICIALS.)

EXT: 1. JORGE ((RISQUET)) VALDEZ SALVANA, A MEMBER OF THR
POLTTIBURO OF THE CUBAN COMMUNIST PARTY (PCC), USED AN EARLY JANUARY
1991 CONFERENCE ON THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS TO LAMBAST THE U.S. FOR
NOT INCLUDING CUBA AS AN EQUAL PARTNER IN MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS
ON A WIDE VARIETY OF POLITICAL AND REGIONAL ISSUES. RISQUET, WHO
HEADED THE CUBAN DELEGATION TO THE MEETING, STARTED HIS DISCOURSE
WITH THE PARIS CONFERENCE OF 1899 AND CONTINUED IN A VITRIOLIC VI
UNTIL HE REACHED THE LATE 1980S, WHEN THE U.S. RESISTED INCLUDING
CUBA IN NEGOTIATIONS TOWARD THE WITHDRAWAL OF CUBAN AND SOVIET TROOPS
FROM ANGOLA. (SOURCE. COb TN” PERSONAT, CONVERSATIONS,

GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS UNREPENTANT AND UNREFORMED--THAT HE
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED BY CHANGES IN COMMUNIST AND MARXIST
PHILOSOPHY, PARTICULARLY IN THE USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE.) JORGE
((POLLO)} GARCIA, INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF THE PCC, SPEAKING
PRIVATELY IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, SAID THAT RISQUET HAD "GONE OFF
ON HIS OWN" DURING THIS SPEECH AND THAT HIS VIEWS SHOULD NOT BE SEEN
AS THE OFFICIAL CUBAN POSITION. POLLO WENT TO CONSIDERABLE LENGTHS
TO ASSUAGE THE CONCERNS OF A WESTERN PARTICIPANT IN THE MEETING.

IT WAS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING THAT POLLO, WHO NEVER
SPOKE DURING THE CONFERENCE AND WHO SEEMED TO BE THERE IN THE ROLE OF
ASSISTANT, WAS THE ONE SENT OUT TO UNDERCUT THE DELEGATION HRAD. THE
DISTINCT IMPRESSION LEFT BY POLLO WAS THAT RISQUET IS CONSIDERED A
HEAVYHANDED LOOSE CANNON. }

+ 2. DURING ANOTHER PRIVATE DISCUSSION, RAFAEL { (HERNANDEZ) },
‘CENTER FOR AMERICAN STUDIES, CONVEYED MUCH THE SAME MESSAGE.
HERNANDEZ TERMED RISQUET AN "OLD THINKER WHO IS CERTAINLY NOT IN THE
LIBERAL WING OF THE LEADERSHIP." HERNANDEZ ALSO SUGGESTED THAT
RISQUET IS ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE INNER CIRCLE. THE LOSS OF HIS
POSITION AS PARTY SECRETARY DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT RISQUET WAS
NOT IMPORTANT, HERNANDEZ SAID, BUT SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS HAVE MADE IT
CLEAR THAT RISQUET IS NO LONGER AS INFLUENTIAL AS HE ONCE WAS.
(SOURCE COMMENT: DURING A SIMILAR MEETING IN MOSCOW DURING LATE
1989, RISQUET MADE A POINT OF GIVING FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS ANDREY ((GROMYKO)) A BEAR HUG; GROMYKO'S PACE WAS FILLED WITH
AN EXPRESSION OF DISGUST.)

3. SERGIO ((DEL VALLE)) JIMENEZ DID NOT PARTICIPATE
EXTENSIVELY IN THE MEETING, DESPITE PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED INTEREST ON
HIS PART, DEL VALLE GAVE A REPORT, IN SPANISH, ON THE MILITARY
ASPECTS OF THE CRISIS FROM THE CUBAN STANDPOINT AND THEN FADED FROM
THE SCENE. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: DEL VALLE WAS VICE MINISTER OF
THE ARMED FORCES FROM 1961 TO 1968. HE SUBSEQUENTLY SERVED aS
MINISTER OF INTERIOR, 1968-1979, AND MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH,
1979-1985.) ANOTHER CUBAN PARTICIPANT INDICATED PRIVATELY THAT
RUMORS HAVE SURROUNDED DEL VALLE SINCE HE LEFT HIS MINISTERIAL
POSITION. THESE RUMORS, ACCORDING TO THE CUBAN OFFICIAL, HAVE
FOCUSED CHIEFLY ON THE FACT THAT DEL VALLE WAS CONSIDERED NOT TOUGH
ENOUGH FOR THE JOB. FOR WHATEVER REASON, DEL VALLE
SEEMED TO STEER CLEAR OF THE REST OF HIS DELEGATION AND THEY STAYED
AWAY FROM HIM; THIS WAS NOTABLE BECAUSE THE REST OF THE GROUP
GENERALLY STAYED TOGETHER. THIS SHOULD BE CONTRASTED WITH DEL
VALLE'S PERFORMANCE DURING THE 1989 MOSCOW CONFERENCE, WHEN HE WAS AN
INTEGRAL PART OF THE CUBAN GROUP.)

4. BRIGADIER GENERAL FABIAN ({ESCALANTE)) FONT, PCC-CC, WHO
INITIALLY WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE VICE MINISTER OF THE MINISTRY OF
INTERIOR BUT LATER AS THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL
AFFAIRS NT AT THE Wi ESCALANTE SPEAKS NEITHER 4
RUS, NOR ENGLISH, THEREFORE REQUIRING A TRANSLATOR, ESCALANTE

SAID THAT HE IS THE NEPHEW OF ANIBEL ((ESCALANTE)), WHO WAS PURGED IN
1962, WENT TO MOSCOW, WAS REHABILITATED, RETURNED TO CUBA, AND

FINALLY PURGED AGAIN IN 1968. ESCALANTE’S FATHER WAS A LEADER OF THE
INTEGRATED REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION (ORI). (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT:
THE ORI WAS THE PRECURSOR OF THE PRESENT-DAY PCC.) THESE POLITICAL
PROBLEMS WITH HIS RELATIVES DID NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR ESCALANTE, HB
SAED PROUDLY, BECAUSE CUBANS ARE ABOVE MAKING PEOPLE SUFFER FOR THE

AT THE ‘TIME OF THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, ESCALANTE SAID THAT HE WAS
“HEAD OF COUNTERESPIONAGE OF A SECTOR" AND THEN EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS
CHIEF OF COUNTERESPIONAGE FOR THE U.S. ESCALANTE
LOOKS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE HELD THAT POSITION IN 1961 OR, ALTERNATELY,
HE HAS BEEN VERY WELL PRESERVED.) ESCALANTE INDICATED THAT HE MADE A
PERSONAL RECONNAISSANCE MISSION OF CUBAN EMIGRE CAMPS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA IN OCTOBER 1960 AND Di IBED THE TRIP IN SOME DETAIL. HE
ADMITTED THAT CUBA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF UPRISINGS IN LATIN
AMERICA DURING THE 1960S AND THAT IT DID IN FACT INSTIGATE SOME
REVOLUTIONS WHICH NEVER QUITE GOT OFF THE GROUND, INCLUDING ONE IN
VENEZUELA. CUBA WAS NOT, HOWEVER, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAMOUS 1962
ARMS CACHE. CUBA DID SUPPLY THE SANDANISTAS, ESCALANTE STATED.

5

7 ALANTE BOASTED THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
“INTERROGATING" ALL SUSPECT "CIA AGENTS" DURING THE 1960S. ALONG
THESE LINES, ESCALANTE SAID THAT THERE WAS EXTENSTVE CUBAN
INFILTRATION OF U.S. ACTIVITIES IN MIAMI DURING THE 1960S, INCLUDING
THE MONGOOSE PROGRAM. WHEN ASKED HOW MANY CUBAN AGENTS WERE IN MIAMI
AT THE TIME, ESCALANTE SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW SPECTFICS. IN FACT,
HE SAID, NO ONE DOES BECAUSE CUBAN RECORDS FROM THE PRRIOD WERE so
HAPHAZARD. HOWEVER, HE STATED ASSURINGLY THERE WAS NO HIGH-LEVEL
CUBAN ASSET IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN 1962, ALTHOUGH HE QUALIFIED
THIS BY ADDING THAT HE HAS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF * POSITIVE
INTELLIGENCE" ACTIVITIES ABROAD. CALANTE ADDED THAT HE BELIEVES
"SOME ELEMENTS OF THE CIA OPERATIONAL ARM" IN COMBINATION WITH THE
MAFIA WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF U.S. PRESTDENT JOHN
F. KENNEDY.
