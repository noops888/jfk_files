"ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required; For information of office of General Counsel

i. As a follow up to conversations between Robert K, TROUCHARD, Terence S.
CRABAMAC and the Office of General Counsél concerning present attenpts to
regain for AMCLATTER-1 hie lost American citizenship, TROUCHARD met
AMCLATTER-1 on 2+ August, TROUCHARD explained that ve vere seeking a bess
for on administrative type of review of his case and needed any recoris vhich
he might nave, such as notices from ODACID concerning his loss of citizen-
ship, notices from his attorneys in his attempts to regain citizenship

end copies of any pertinent correspondence, The objective is to determine if
his citizenship can be reatored without his having to leave the country,
return in en inmigrant status, and vait for a period of five years,

2. AMCLATTER-1 stated that he had nothing in writing since he hed to leave
FARUMEN eurreptiviously, He eould only add the folloving commentary to those
records which vere already in ODACID or ODURGE files: According to his
recollection, the paragraph of the Nationality Act (he believes it to be
Section 5) by which he was separated from his citizenship status stated that
before procedure can be taken to remove anyone's citizenship he must have
Prior notification that quch procedure is being conteupiated and be allowed
‘to express his side of the question, AMOLATTER-1 states that he vas never
called in to be questioned, but received an after-the-fact notification in
Writing that 'e was no longer en American citizen, At this same tise, hove
ever, be states that he vas a constant visitor at ODACID vhere he had worked
in close cooperation with the ODENVY office and his address was 02 record
vith ODACID so that he could be reached easily at any tine,

3. The efforts of tue office of General Counsel and ODURGE Fepresentatives
in this matter are greatly appreciated.
