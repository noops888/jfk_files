rclaiing to maritine operations in the early 1960's and a note-

book, copies of which were nace available to the Miami Station

In further coordination with the FBI iir. Esterline

confined

that Bernard Barker had been a CIA employes and

that tir. Martinez, who was well known to the FBI to have been

a CIA enployee, was no longer an active enployee but was

maintained as an informant.

Mr. Esterline advised the FBI.

there might be one or

two telophone nunbers in vir.

Martinez' notebook relating to the Miani Station inasmuch as

It. Martinez had been provided a means of effecting emergency

contact with the Station.

The FBI said it would be alert

to this possibility and accepted Mir. Esterline's statement

that the Station had been totally unaware of dir. Martinez'

secret relations with dr. tunt.

The FlI pronised to avoid

disclosure of the fact that CIA had been instrumental in

helping then locate tir. Martinez' car because of the probisms

it could create for the source who had reported the matter to

CIA.
