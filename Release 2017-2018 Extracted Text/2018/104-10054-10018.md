MEZORANDUM FOR: Chief, WID for Cuba

SUBJECT

: Espinosa Allegations

1.

Sensitivity: Regardless of accuracy, they

prasanted to other goverment aganeleas

present a problem because of their baving been

in view of matters touching on U.S. security,

ara delicate and could have unfavorable repercusaions :

if repeated to newsmen by the complaint or his

associates (whose independent, previous threats were

of greater potential embarraament);

affect the reputations and the security of our

porsonnel at Madrid and Paris.

2. Action:

In vier of the foregoing, the allegationg

A.

should be put in proper perspactive - 1,e., not

Ignored bocause of the potential embarrassment but

considered in the light of what ve already know

(Almost all of then are repetitions of previous

charges and reports, known well to both the Madrid

and Paris stations and to lendquarters officers

concerned with the AMLASH group, whose members'

reliability, reputations and good faith are question-

able.

of the charges - aboat

and

"Tote"

and about AMWHIP-1 and CARRILIO - are new.);

B.

should be treated so as to protect us against any

charge of larity and so as to establish the lacts but,

at the same time, treated so as to avoidattributing

to then nore importance than they deserve;

C. should be kept in mind as examples of other

charges which my belandied about and reported by the

AMLASH group to other governmental agencies or to

other governments or to news nedia (In the last

connection recall the inplied threat of publishing

ODYOK? responsibility, as reported previously by

NADR-3716, IN 38634.);

should be examined together with all the other

available reports so that we may

(1) clarily our own objectives and wishes with

respect to all the AlLASA group (and this includes

AMIHIR);

(2) sort out which people, 1f any, are worth our

time in the future;

(3) take appropriate measures, including inter-

rogation and polygraphing, to clarify doubts and

then, when necessary, terminate those who are

working for us but are not worthwhile;

(4)

tighten up our own operational and security

procedures in connection with the AllASH group.

3.

Preliminary Analysig:

As pointed out in a preliminary

analys1s of the ALASt complex, made in March 1965 wher

I was

proparing for travel to Madrid in connection with the @JIOPS-1

There is no convincing evidence that the group is

working either for or against the regise of Fidel CASTRO.

Reports on their contacts with us and their discussions

thenselves are at variance.

In 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly

knowing that they were plotting against bin,

talked to AMLASH-1

and seven nembers of his group to enlist their support against

Anibal ESCALANTI Dellunde and the communiste in Cuba.

Possibly

they are piaying both ends against the middle.

They

certainly

have been and are in contact with the two ende."

The following

cranents are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AlLASH conspiracy - As detailed by HADE-3716

(IN 28634) on 6 April 1965, QUSPORT-I reporting on a meeting

od the AlLisH group, Including AWHIP-1 mentioned the following

sigaificant points:

KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around lo1

years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

(2) the group was to be prepared to denounce

ODYOKE as responsible 1f the operation fails and believed that

the resulting scandal would make the Bay of Pigs seem insigni

ficant; and

(3)

AMLASH-3 was in touch with Cuban

Intelligence

as estaglisted by coded messages which he exhibited.

As reported by PARI-1532 (IN 82939) on 4 June 1965, based on

neetings with ESPINOSA, the problen seen

by Paris is that

"the AMLASH circle is wide and each new friend of whom we learn

seens to have knowledge

of the plan."

I believe that the

•problem is a nore serious and basic

one.

As Indicated in

paragraph 3 of the present memorandum,

Fidel CASTRO himself

reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the

group was plotting

enlisted its support.

cannot rule out

the possibility of provocation

Assassination,

obvioualy, is a dangerous game, not merely to the plotters in

a physical sense, but to a sponsoring governent which mar

suffer severe political repercussions at home and abroad 1f its

In the instant case, the Ilsks of

exposure of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, whether there is

a provocation or not.

Considering the individuals who are

involved directly, their contacta with RUBART cificers, and theis

reported pila to expose OlYOks, persisting in the plan could

be highly embarrassing to KUBARK.

This is even more the case

now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODENVY and ODUrGE,

although

fortunately the tenor of his complaint was that KUBARK bad not

given adequate support to the plan.)

в.

The contacts at Paris and the matters affecting

the Paris Station. - The

"recruitment" of laureen had been the

subject of an exchange of cables between Paris and Headquarters

and of discussions at Headquarters betwoen VH/C and VE (See

PARI-1071 (IN 66557) and DII-10955).

The annoying

thing 1n

this connection now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to

ODENVY and ODURCE and the danger that,

if he is

indisczeet,

his story anous this (and the other matters) could reach some

curious newspaperman.

(In this connection, it appears that the

questionable decision to put Maureen in touch

sTOp was wade without the knowledge of STOCHOOD. the AMLASH

ESPINOSA

did not report any criticism of the KUBARkers at Paris but 1t

is evident that the AMlASH group knows more about them than

we might wish.

What is new and of concern from ESPINOSA about

matters 1n paris is his story of AWHIP 1 and JNSNAFU-19

deslings.

concers also to Headguarters which has been running hin and

Madrid which he has visited often.

(On the occasion of my

previous trip to lindrid on the QUIOPS-1 case, GHOWERY had voiced

ais doubts about the whole group and specifically about Al BIP-

und his connection with UNSNATI 19.

At issue are two basic

points, the knowledge on the part of UNSNAFU-19 about EUBARK's

connection with AMHIP 1 and the charge that AWHIP-1 has been

defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction. Also to be Lept

in mind is the fact that ODENVY has an offico In Paris which

well might have been informed of the allegations and which night

have been asked for comments - although ODENVY policy always

has been to stay away from any investigation of other government

agencies unless specifically directed by the Attorney General

to investigate.

C.

Criticism of the Madrid Station - Criticism

the Madrid Station by the Allash group is not new.

AMLASE -2

and -3 were in Madrid and wanted direct contact, but the

Station has had reservations about seeing them.

The Station has

been involved indirectly because of reporting by its sources

about and involvement of Station targets with both the AlLiSH

and ANYORLD operations (both handled fron Headquarters).

(See MADH-2982 (IN 72256) and MADR-2998 (IN 73094) (both RYBAT) •).

Meetings anong QUBPORT, QUSWIIT-1, ALWHIP-I and AMLASH figures

produced conflicting reports which prevously were discussed at

Madrid and at Headquartors.

Insofar as GROWERY himself 15

concerned, It must be kept i, mind that he is a natural target

on whom the AlIASH soup would be inclined to locus its cou

plaints.

with regard to the specific complaint about

"Tota"

GROWERY has Identified her as GUSWIFT-T and has reported that

no staffer fron the Station ever had contact with her.

Further Involvenent of ESPINOSA:

On 10 June ODENVY

notified kunak at New York that AMLISH-2 had telephoned

ESPINOSA to ask whether he had succeeded in contacting

proper people" • 1.8.,

responsible KUBARX representativos - and

to request notice of

the regalting arrangements.

AXWHIP-1: Our plan calla for meting him next week

to obtain PRy Information and to obtain clarification of the

roles played by those involved with him in the ANLACH operation.

His dealings with UNSNATU-19 also will be covered. Following

this, an LCFLUTTER examination is planned.

This my heip to

determine whether he has been truthful in his reporting.
