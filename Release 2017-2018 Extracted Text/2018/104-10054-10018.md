MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WHD for Cuba
SUBJECT

i.

3 Espinosa Allegations

Sensitivity: Regardless of accuracy, they

A. present a problem because of their having been
presented to other government agenci:

B. in view of matters touching on U.S. security,

are delicate and could have unfavorable repercussions
if repeated to newsmen by the complainant or his
associates (whose independent, previous threats were
of greater potential embarrassment);

C. affect the reputations and the security of our
personnel] at Madrid and Paris.

Action: in view of the foregoing, the allegations

A, should be put in proper perspective - i.e., not
ignored because of the potential embarrassment but
considered in the light of what we already know {,

(Almost all of them are repetitions of previous

charges and reports, known well to both the Madrid

and Paris stations and to Headquarters officers —
concerned with the AMLASH group, whose members’
reliability, reputations and good are question-
able. Tyo of the charges - about and “Tota”

and about AMVHIP-1 and CARRILLO - are new.);

B. should be treated so as to protect us against any
charge of laxity and so as to eatablish the facts but, © ---|
at the same time, treated so as to avoid attributing
to them more importance than they deserve;

Cc. should be kept in mind as examples of other
charges which may belandied about and reported by the
ANLASH group ‘to other governmental agencies or to
other governments or to news media (In the last
connection recall the implied threat of publishing
ODYOKE responsibility, as reported previously by
MADR-3716,IN 38634.);

D. should be examined together with ail the other
available reports so that we may

(1) clarify our own objectives and wishes with
respect to a11 the AMLASH group (and this includes
AMWHIP) 5

{2) sort out which people, if any, are worth our
time in the future;

(3) take appropriate measures, including inter
rogation and polygraphing, to clarify doubts and
then, when necessary, terminate those who are
working for us but are not worthwhile;

(4) tighten up oar own operational and security
procedures in connection with the AMLASH group.

3. Epeligieery Analysis: As pointed out in a preliminary
analysis 6. compiex, made in March 1965 when I was
preparing for travel to Madrid in connection with the QUHOPS-i

«There is no convincing evidence that the group is
working either for or against the regire of Fidel CASTRO.
Reports om their contacts with us and their discussions among
themselves are at variance. In 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly
knowing that they were plotting against hin, talked to AMLASH-1
and seven members of his group to enlist their support against
Anibal BSCALANTE Dellunde and the communists in Cuba. Possibly
they are playing both ends against the middle. They certainly
have been and are in contact with the two ends." The following
ccnments are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AMLASH conspiracy - As detailed by MADR-3716
(IN 28634) on 6 April 1965, QUSPORT-1 reporting on a meeting
of the AMLASH group, including AMWHIP-1 mentioned the following
significant points:

(1) KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around for
years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

(2) the group was to be prepared to denounce
ODYOKE as responsible if the operation fails and believed that
the resulting scandal would make the Bay of Pigs seem insigni-
ficant; and

(3) AMLASH-3 was in touch with Cuban Intelligence
as established by coded messages which he exhibited.

As reported by PARI-1532 (IN 82939) on 4 June 1965, based on
meetings with ESPINOSA, the problem seen by Paris is that



"the AMLASH circle is wide and each new friend of whom we learn
seema to have knowledge of the plan." I believe that the

‘problem is a more serious and basic one. As indicated in

paragraph 3 of the present memorandum, Fidel CASTRO himself
reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the group was plotting
against him and, knowing it, enlisted its support. Hence we
cannot rule out the possibility of provocation. Assassination,
obviously, is a dangerous game, not merely to the plotters in
@ physical sense, but to a sponsoring government which may
suifer severe political repercussions at home and abroad if its
involvement is made known. In the instant case, the risks of
exposure of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, whether there is
@ provocation or not. Considering the individuals who are
involved directly, their contacts with RUBARX cfficers,and their
reported plan to expose ODYOKE, persisting in the plan could

be highly embarrassing to KUBARK, (This is oven more the case
now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODENVY and ODURGEZ, although
fortunately the tenor of his complaint was that KUBARK had not
given adequate support to the plan.)

B. The contacts at Paris and the watters affecting

the Paris Station.- The "recruitment" of Maureen had been the
subject of an exchange of cables between Paris and Headquarters
ind of discussions at Headquarters between YH/C and WE (See
PARI-1071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955). The annoying thing in
this connection now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to
ODENVY and ODURGS and the danger that, if he is indiscrest,

his story about this (and the other matters) could reach sone
curious newspaperman. (In this connection, it appears that the
questionable decision to put Maureen in touch with the AMLASH
group was made without the knowledge of STOCKYCOD.} ESPINOSA
did not report any criticism of the KUBARKers at Paris bat it

is evident that the AMLASH group knows more about them than

we might wish. What is new and of concern from ESPINOSA about
matters in Paris is his story of AMWHIP.1 and UNSNAFU-19
dealings. The questions raised about AMWHIP-1 are of mutual
concera also to Headquarters which has been running him and
Madrid which he has visited often. (On the occasion of my
previous trip to Madrid on the QUHOPS-1 case, GHOWERY had voiced
his doubts about the whole group and specifically about AMVHIP-1
and his connection with UNSNAFU-19.) At issue are two basic
points, the knowledge om the part of UNSNAFU-19 about KUBARK's
connection with AMWHIP-1 and the charge that AMWHIP-1 has been
defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction. Also to be kept
in mind is the fact that ODENVY has an office in Paris which
well might have been informed of the allegations and which might
have been asked for comments - although ODENVY policy always

has been to stay away from any investigation of other government
agencies unless specifically directed by the Attorney General

to investigate.



C. Criticism of the Madrid Station - Criticism of
the Madrid Station by the AMLASH group is not new. AMLASH-2
and -3 were in Madrid and wanted direct contact, but the
Station has had reservations about seeing them. The Station has
been involved indirectly because of reporting by its sources
about and involvement of Station targets with both the AMLASH
and AMWORLD operations (both handled from Headquarters).
(See MADR-2982 (IN 72256) and MADR-2998 (1N 73094) (both RYBAT).}.
Meetings among QUSPORT, QUSWITT-1, AMWHIP-1 and AMLASH figures
produced conflicting reports which previously were discussed at
Badrid and at Headquarters. Insofar as GROWERY himself is
concerned, it must be kept in mind that he is a natural target
on whom the AMLASH group would be inclined to focus its com-
plaints. With regard to the specific complaint about "Tota", _
GROWERY has identified her as QUS¥IFT-7 and has reported that 7
no staffer from the Station ever had contact with her.

4. Further invoivement of ESPINOSA: On 10 June ODENVY
notified KUBARK at New York that AMLASH-2 had telephoned
ESPINOSA to ask whether he had succeeded in contacting “the
proper people" - i.e., responsible KUBARK representatives - and
to request notice of the resulting arrangements.

5. AMWHIP-1: Our plan calls for meeting him next week
to obtain PRO information and to obtain clarification of the
roles played by those involved with him in the AMLASH operation.
Hig dealings with UNSNAYU-19 also will be covered. Following
this, an LCFLUTTER examination is planned. This may heip to
determine whether he has been truthful in his reporting.
