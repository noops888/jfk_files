Performance Report

(Summary of evaluation of past performance /If applicable7 with emphasis
and ceteils of current performance for *ssignec operational tas«s)

baits LOCATION AGENCY TASK i
GERENDE was: recruited in March 1955, just prior to his graduation from

the Mexico City College. He was trained as a member of a surveillance

team, and was also used as an investigator to collect operational data

on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was leader of

the team.

He was also used as a basehouse keeper in an audio operation and
Processor of tapes, He exailed in this type of work because of his bi-
lingual Spanish/English facility, and, more importantly, due to his dw er-
sified experience in clandestine operations which permited him to spot
operational leads.

Since 1958 his primary use has been as main cutout/principal agent
to a group of photographic basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy,
and one mobile photographic truck. He processes the raw photographic t ake
and services the majority of the accomodation addresses used by the
Station. He has contributed significantly to the AMROD operation

He performs all his tasks in a professional manner. He is well suited
to intelligence work, and plans to make KUBARK his career. The Station
depends heavily on him because of his knowledge of Mexico, and his mobility
as a Mexican. He works full time for KUBARK; cover company requires very
little time.

In case of "New Hire" give © personality assessment in terms of
capability, attitude, and projected suitability; state names of
Division personnel who have interviewed him; give account of his
performance in current non-Agency job. u

ACTIN RE QUEED - UREN ey
Reference: HMw-122b4 dated 24 Jamary 1964

1, Station Mexico City fully arrecs with Headquarters evaluation of Subject as
a “valueble long tera asset with stay behind potential." In order to place the matter
of the 2,100 pesos in the apropriste frame of reference it is felt that a few teck-
ground points should be noted,

In Jercary 1956 the LIMMTY/LILYRIC basehovse was set up end placed in operation
ina site viich provided visual ecvernge of the LIMGRICK installetion. A dezosit of
three months rent vas cade per teiz3 of the rental contract at tha: time (2,10 pesos.)
In April 1961 the building in which LIEMPTY/LILYRIC is located was sold by the omer.
Yorsally the rental deosit wouli =ave been trenaferred to the nev cyner es yart of
the sale transaction, lowever, e2,roximtely three months efter the transfer of the
property to the new omer, the rental deposit was returned to the besehouse operator,
LISVTY-1%. The deposit was then returned to G2RENDS, GERENDE afd not inform the
then LIM°TY case officer nor the present ense officer ef the retum of the iT MPTY/
LILYRIC ceposit. ‘Ti:is 2,100 pesos continued to be carried on the Stetion o
en outstanding operntional advance charged to GLIDE, GUID! used part of thio
2,100 pesos to maze loans to two cents (LIYTY-6 ami LIQVTY-9.) It is probably
that he also used sore of this on occassion for his om purposes,

On 16 October 1963 OERENDE returned tha 2,100 posos to the case officer and the
Station hes. adjusted {ts books to rerlect the return of this money. O=RENDE noted
at the tive of the return that he had this coney intact but did not know how to fo
about retumning it so long after raving received it. This 1s the case as he stated at
he tine of the LCFLUIT=R interview. GEREMDS was obvicssly inpressed with his inability
to "beat" the ICFIUITER. He was sincerely remorseful when talking to the case officer

ebout the incident end has tvice etated that nothing of this nature vould happen again.
With the reality of Juture LCPIMITER tests set firmly in OZRENDZ's wind, it is believed
that he will not attezpt any such ection again.

‘An to what can be done of a positive nature (other than perioile re-LCPLWWITIR) to
prevent recurrence {t must be roted that GALNDE kept ayart the 7,100 pesos wh.
really still charged to hia and the Station had no vay of imovin; thet the zore
been returned to biz by the tasesousexeezer. Only when the close ccxn of the i!
LILYRIC be se would be effected would the Station expect to have the rental deposit
returned. Until such tine the deposit would remain charged to GSASNDE, The only ¥ay
to completely safeguard arainst this type of action would be for case officer to
neet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby elintnating GERQD2
ani causing unaccepteble security risks. It 1s believed that periodic LCFLVIT:R of
GHRENDE is the best insurance against a sicilar occurence in the future.

As to GERSDE's regular operational revolving fund, irregularities have never
been discovered in his handling of these funds. Cash counts are corlucted by the

case officer to control the wispent portion of the revolving fund by ccaparison with
accountings (receipts) GXEND2 cakes every two Weeks, GciuNDits revolving fund {s
kept at the minisun asount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for vatch
GERSNDZ 1s responsible.

‘The “other false claims” O2R:NDE adzitted making involved occasional use of his
GP vehicle for personal driving vhile entering all receipts for gas cn his KUBARK
accountings. Station does not consider this a major problem. If G5CNDE used hie <P
car for only operational employzent any hostile surveillance of him vould be relatively
easy (i.¢e., surveilling only when he is using his QP vehicle) and it is believed that
latitude mist be alloved in this area for indigenous agents.

2. In the area of GERENDZ's moraleand his statement that he “is not being
utilized to his full potential” the Station is as fully concerned as Headquarters. It
should be noted however, that OUNDE has never written the report setting rorth what
he thinks he can do and when proided on this has stated that he had been thinking about
whet additional work he could assume and that he "Just does not know". The reason he
gives is he docs not know vhat elce is being done in the operations aren other than thet,
to Waich he is already exposed. Additional operational work io assigned to G=RENNE
when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations.
An example of this was his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station is reluctant
to expose O=R-2DE to additional operations only for the purpose of ‘Improving his morale”
since he already has considerable knowledge of many Station past and going operations.
The Station appreciates Headquarters cocacnts on the results of GSRENDZ's LCFLUTTR
and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GRINDS in

1. Reference is made to the results :f the LCPLUTTER interview
of Raymond H, GSRENDE which was held on 8 October 1963, Headquarters
would like to have a progress report on what steps have been taken
by the Case Officer with regard to tho 2,100 pesos which he had
kept but belc.ged to KUBARK, Headquarters is also interested in
what has been done about other falev claims he admitted making in
his accountings, and what precautions are being taken to see that
this does not continue in the future.

2. The Station's comments are requested on GERENDE's statement
that he ie not being utilized to his full potential and that he
often has free tice, Ecadquarters would be interested in seeing
a copy of the report which the LCFLUTTER examiner suggested he write,
setting forth vhat he (GL4LNDE) thinks he can do and what he would
like to do. Headquarters consicors GiREXDE a valuable long tern
asset with staybehing potential, and it is hoped that the Station
will do whst it can within the limits of security, to raise his morale
and see that KUBARK ig receiving full benefit of his services.

Amendment of Subject's contract

cor

1, By reference Subject's annual saiary was increased to is present
figure of US $5, 040,00,

2, Station hereby requests a further increase in Subject's annual
salary to US $5, 500.00 based upon Subject's outstanding performance as
Principal Agent in the LIEMPTY project, The latest LIEMPTY Project
Renewal Request, recently forwarded to Headquarters, detailed GERENDE's
duties, In Station's opinion, the noted salary increase is considered justified
not only from agent's excellent fob performance, but also as an incentive
to continued superior work as well as an offset to the inflationary trend of
the cost of living In Mexico,

3. It ts requested that Headquarters initlate the appropriate amend-
ment to GERENDE's contract (ncreasing his yearly salary to themted figure

HMMA-15979, KAPOK~1842 dated 18 November 1960

1, In compliance with the KUBARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60,
Annex A, concerning contact arrangments under emergency conditions, the
following information, including recognition signals and bona fides, is
forwarded for Headquarters records, Due to the sensitivity of the information,
it was believed more appropriate to forward it separately rather than to
include ir with reference (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY).

2, Insofar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could
probably be contacted at one of the following places:

a, Present Residence: IDENTITY A

b, Mother's Residence: : IDENTITY B

c, Cover Employment Address: IDENTITY C

3. The following oral recognition signals, using the English language,
are to be used as indicated:

OONTACT: "Mr, (GERENDE-true name), I bring the most
sincere wishes and grectings from your Aunt
and Uncle."

GERENDE; "Then you are referring to the IDENTITY D,”

CONTACT: "No, Iam referring to your other relatives in
South Carolina, the IDENTITY E Pp

GERENDE: "Yes, Auntie is my Mother's sister."

4, For use as physical bona fides, the Station is forwarding a one peso
note with the serial number T348510 for Headquarters files, GERENDE has
been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number, T348511, to
keep in a safe place pendins his having to show it to some future KUBARK contact.
It has been explained to GERENDE that he is to show his half of the physical

bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and

accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see his physical bona
fides. GERENDE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contact’s
bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510).

5. Assuming that adequate time will be available at the beginning of an
emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret
Writing so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY D or E
addresses. -

1, Forwarded herewith as Attachment No, One is GERIZNDE's signed ‘
contract amendment, GERENDE is mos: appreciative for the raise in salary
and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment claus>,

2, The Station interprets the Terminal Payment clause to mean any
termination by the Government or acceptance of GERENDE's resiynation in
the “best interests of the Government," Examples in connection with the “best
interests of ihe Government" interpretation would involve GERENDE's resignation
for health reasons or other logical personal rcasons such a8 a change of residence
to some geographical area where his services could not be utilized by KUBARK,
Assuming that no security problems are involved tn making such a payment, the
Station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to GERENDE's estate
in the event of his death while tn the employ of KUBARK,

3, The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as
originally requested and concurs in Headquarters reasoning, Certainly, the Station
would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he hag been so informed,
if he elects to resign just to reccive some extra moncy or to puraue some other
career, The Station hastens to add, however, that to the best of fta knowledge,
GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK Job,

4. A8& requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No, Two are the
original and one copy of the contract amendment dated | Sepiember 1957, Head-
quarters wili note that the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved b

ie but was not formally witnessed, It is suggested that

New Contract for Raymond H. GEKENDE (p) a

Headquarters preparation of a new contract.

reverence,

HMMW-5626, 3 December 1957

1, Raymond H, GERENDE was initially employed by the Station on 18 March
1955 under provisions of an oral agreement, Effective 1 October 1955 GERENDE
was placed under a written contract, prepared by Headquarters, with an annual
salary of $3,500.00, On | September 1957 his contract was amended to increase
his salary to $4,080.00 per annum, which is the salary he is presently receiving.
It is requested that a new two year contract he prepared, to be effective 1 July 1959,
providing an increase in salary to $4,550,00 per annum and including a termination
clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one month's salary,
calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for
each full year of his KUBARK employment, All other provisions of GERENDE's
initial contract should remain in force, (The increase in salary to $4, 560,00
per annum is already covered by the LIEMPTY Project.)

i
i

2, As pointed out in the attachment to HMMA-11368, 22 Octuber 1958,
paragraph three of MEXI-2836, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Field
Project Outline, GERENDE is a highly valued full-time Station asset who carries
a significant work load and who has a great deal of responsibility, He is the
LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA hase
houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans-
lation service and all the agents participating in these activities, He performs
his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent
abilities are showing continued improvement,

3, Paragraph eight of HMMA-12095, 4 February 1959, indicated that the
Station was considering amending GERENDE's contract to provide for some type

of retirement benefits, Although it is recognized that indigenous agents are not
usually granted such contract provisions, the Station believes that GERENDE should
have monetary Incentive, in addition to his idealogy, to make a long career with
KUBARK,. Accordingly, the Station recommends thac GERENDE's new contract
provide for a termination settlement of one month's galary for each full year that
he has worked for KUBARK. In other words, should GERENDE's career with
KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this period is $3,000.00
then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum payment of $16,000.00, After
considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow account and several
other ideas, the Station considers the above proposal to come closest to meeting
the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make
KUBARK acarcer, The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date
for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits,

OPERATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW OF i

AYMOND H, GEXENDE'S
OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES

SITUATION

agents, one of whom was Raymond H, H

58, the Chief of Stattod decided that hould be asatyned

erations, ea REE REE

PURPOSE ,
The purpose of this operational security review ts threefold:

a, To tdentify possible security problems and conditions;
Tec establish a framework ior recommendations which will
result tn the Station's submission of a new support project
(LIEMPTY) with Raymond H, GERENDE as a principal agent; and |
c To acquaint the new case officer with the operational problems :
and agent pereonnel with which be should have a comprehensive |
knowledge ais! detailed understanding,

PRINCIPAL AGENT - Ra: H, GERENDE

a Beceground + GERENDE has been employed by KUBARK since
18 March > Which was fust prior to his graduatton from the Mexico
Clty College. He is now only 24 years of age, but in the Station's opinion, 1
ig a mature, experienced and dedicated KUBARK contract agent. During i
the three and one-half years that he has been working for the Mexico

City Station, GERENDE has participated in a varied assortment of xt !
and intelligence operations, Initially, he was tratned and used| }

Cremrecmat a member of the LIPSTICK survetilance team, tion,
work, he was used as an investigator to collect operational |

data on persons and organizations of interest to the Station, He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was the leader of i
the LIPSTICK team, He has been used es a LIFEAT Base House operator

SECRET

cath.


- formal projects.such as BGMORNINGS

SECRET

and processor of tapes; he has excelled tn thia type of work because of
his bi-lingual Spantsh/English foctizy and, more importantly, due to
his diversified cxpertence in clandestine operations which permits him
to spot operational leads much more readily than the average LIFEAT
monitor,

b, Duties - GERENDE ts currently serving as the principal agent
in charge of LIMITED, LiCALIA, LIPSTICK Photo Truck, LIJERSEY
Surveillance Team and LILYRIC, In additton, he monttors and processes
the EGMORNING and Cuban Exiles LIFEAT taps, He also supervises

the photographic processing of LIPSTICK-38 (his brother-in-law) and the
translation work of LIPSTICK-40 (nis aister), Hie maintains contact with
and provides administrative support to LIMITATIONS 5.and 6, LICOOL-7
Base operators, Quite obviously GERENDE's many diities overlap the
bounds of several Station operations, namely LIPSTICK, LIJERSEY,
LIFEAT, LICOOL and several acne which are not listed under _. ».
“lt ts recognized by t the Station
that {t fg not advisable to have one princtpal agent connected with ag
many operations as is GERENDE, However, the present scarcity of
both staff and contract agents of the principal agent type neceasttate
such efficiency measures, Every effort is being made to compartment
the various segments of GERENDE's operations and to decrease, and
to eliminate where possible, all lateral communications between
agents,

c seer Problems - The most sertous securtty situation
surrounding CE] jE and his many activiries fs the fact that

LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the LIPSTICK Team members arrested

{a the June 1958 flap) know GERENDE by true name, end knew thet he

algo worked for KUBARK. In iact, LIPSTICK-30 ts a close personal
friend of GERENDE's and was originally recommended for KUBARK
employment by GERENDE, The operational security hypothesis that

can be constructed from these existing acquaintances are too numerous

to Mst in thia brief review; suffice to say that should GERENDE be
arrested by one of the local police agencies, most of the remaining
support assete would be destroyed or so seriously compromised thar

the Station would indeed be foolish to continue using them, It ts
appropriate to state here, however, that netther GERENDE nor the

Station believes that GERENDE has yet been named or otherwise
identified as a result of the LIPSTICK flap, It is granted though that

any future questions by one of the local police agencies to the compro-
mised LIPSTICKERS represents a continuing type of danger for GERENDE,
Based on the duties which GERENDE ts currently performing, the readers
of this review can well imagine what the consequences to several operations

SECRET

|
H



SECRET

would be tf GERENDE were arrested by one of the local police agencies
and interrogated tn detail, Also, the Station must forever be aware that
the Incal police agencies are certainly capable, for only a few dollars, of
selling tuformarion concerning KUBARK to the Soviets and/or Satelittes,

a, Recommendations - It would be unwise to consider terminating
GERENDE since he fa a highly competent agent and since hts termination
would not eliminate the fact that he knows a great deal about the Station's
Gupport operations, He nas becn reminded several times, and the Case
Officer will continue to remind him, that hig tradecraft professionalism
must {mprove and stay ahead of the trcreasing sophistication of the local
police agenctes and opposition services operating in Mexteo,

~ It ts the’opinton af the ‘Station that GERENDE should continue
ae used in about the same raanner that he {2 presently betag used, It
would be advisable, however, to separate him. from the two LIE,
funertiiia tie ta‘cirrently handling,” BGMORNING’tnd thé ‘Cuban
taps, This te suggested not only because of the possible future securtty
ramifications, but also because GER ENDE does not have time to run
properly his support mechanism and to monitor taps seven days a week,

To provide for a situation whereby one of the local police
agenctes becomes aware of GERENDE's illegal activities and assuming
that etther GERENDE or the Station learns of this before the local police
agency can take positive action, it {s imperative that a warning system
of communications be established to fuctlttate GERENDE's removal
from Mexico, Arrangements such ag those used for
could be set up or local arrangements could be made
ODOATH for a more expeditious exit from Mexico, The Case Officer
will develop this plan in detail,

LIPSTICK-28 until 15 July 1958 assisted his father with photo-
graphic work at the LIMITED Base, However, on the above
date he decided to resiyn from his LIMITED job and, strange
as {t may seem, to devote full time to working on a chicken
farm, LIPSTICK-28 made this dectston on his own and against
the wishes of his father, He will continue to live at the

with LIPSTICR- { contact points away from

used for their meetings, Usually the place of contact ts pre 1

communication exists whereby GEREN! ICK-14

overt occupation is
consequently, there ts a cover basis for such a telephonic

-IZ(GERENDE's opinion), Since LIPSTICK-14 has |
known LIMEWATER (LIFEAT Project) for many years and since |
LIMEWATER is LIPSTICK-2's brother, tt is important to recognize
that the desirable degree of compartmentation between LIPSTICK/
LIMITED and LIFEAT probably does not exist, Although LIMEWATER |
must be aware of LIPSTICK-14's and 2's PEPRIME employment, |
ft has not beea possible to ascertain the extent of LIMEWATER’s =. |

LIJERSEY-12 is the wife of LERSEY-2, She docs most of the
photographic and reporting work at the LILYRIC Base and has
proven herself to be a capable and worthwhile asset, It has

been necessary for her to become proficient in the LILYRIC work
since her husband works ot his regular job during the day, She
receives a monthly salary of $800,00 (MN), _

mrmunications - GERENDE conuicta LIERSEY-5 twice
‘at prearranged contact points during|

lat prearranged car contact points receives the “take
m the LILYRIC Base, On occasion GERENDE has contacted
LIJERSEY-~-2 directly, but this procedure is used only when LIERSEY-5,
is out of town or otherwise not avatlable, GERENDE does not
know LJERSEY~12 or vice versa, Norcserve syatem of come
municatfons exists whereby a Station officer could contact
LIJERSEY-2 directly should the need arise; however, GERENDE has
been instructed to set up such a system of communications, The
same will be done with LIJERSEY*§, although he is known to
several Station officers and little difficulty would be experienced
in contacting him directly,

(4) Security - The security of the LILYRIC Base eppears,

at least Ga paper, to be in better shape than the Limited or
LICALLA Bases, Insofar as the Case Officer has been able

to determine, the only indigenous agents aware of the LILYRIC
Base are GERENDE, LIJERSEYS 2, 5 and 12, and LIPSTICKS

38 and 40, and all of these individuals have a close connecticn
with the operation of the Base, The only tie-in the LILYRIC Base
has with the LIPSTICK operations is through GERENDE,

(5) Recommendations - GERENDE has been instructed

to change hia meeting plans with LIJERSEY-5 andto review -

the communications set-up between LJERSEY-5 and LIJERSEY-2

(L-5 and L-2 are long-time friends and, consequently, the

cover problem ts minimized), A staggered achedule of

coverage of the LIMERICK target between LILYRIC and LIMITED

was initlated on 18 August 1958, Although the operators of

these two bases are unaware of the existence of the other,

@ suitable cover story has been worked out to satisfy any

curtostty that LIPSTICK~14 and LIERSEYS-2 and 12 may have. This |
procedure is beltevext dzstrable cue to the confining nature of the H
photographic tasks and the lack of addltlonal personnel to assist |
at each of the bases, Also, this stoggered schedule of coveraye H
should reduce some of the duplication presently coming tn from
the two bases,

Cc LICALLA

t (1) Target - Statfonary photogrp hic survetlance of persons
and activities tn den area of the LIMERICK installation,

(2) Personnel - LIPSTICK-39, his wife end three small childrea
__live at Uic LICALLA Base, He ta an| i

in the target's garden area, He receives a monthly salary of
$2, 000,00 (MN) and free rent at the LICALLA Base,

(3) Communteations - GERENDE mects LIPSTICK~39 twice

and secure communications procedures, GERENDE has been
directed to establish a reserve’ system of communications with
Lipstick-39, using the customary oral and physical bonafides,

4 Security” The most sertous security problem concerning
LICA! a fact that LIPSTICK-39 ts the brother of
LIPSTICK-4'

Although tt ts generally

feved by Station officers that LIPSTICK-39's name was not
mentioned by LIPSTICK-47 nor that any indication was given
concerning LIPSTICK-39's job, tt must be understood that
should the local police agency decide later to interrogate
LIPSTICK-47, the probability exists of compromising LIPSTICK-39
} and LICALLA, The Station sees no way to overcome this
| possibility,

SECRET



SECRET

It is {nsportant to note here that LICALLA occuptes one of the four
LIMUST properties, While it ts believed that LIPSTICK-39 does
not know that KUBARK owrs the Base or has anything to do with
the other three houses, ir {s entirely concetvable thar should one
of the local police agenctes or the LIMLAICK pcrsonnel become
aware of LICALLA activities, they could very easily arrive at
some logical conclusions about all of t:2 LLMUST property, This
would be detrimental, if not fatal, to our aims, However,

another Station viewpoint on this same problem ts that {f compromtsed,
LICALLA would divert suspicion from, rather than to, LIMUST,
Should one of the local police agenctes begin an investigation which
might tavolve LIMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be”
sacrificed to protect the LIMUST Base, These possibilittes
become somewhat theoretical and perhaps tmpractical due

to the lack of predicttbility of the-loéal polt@eagenctes, but‘heverthé=

lesa must be weighed one against the other,

In view of the apparent importance of the LIMESA/LIMUST
operation @ lot of thought and discussion have transptred at the
Statioa about cc -tinuing the LICALLA operatioa in tts present
location or suspending tt for the immediate future and attempting
to find another sultable locetion away from the LIMUST property,
A sound ergument can be made for termtnating the base since such
an alternative might have the effect of limtring any knowledge
LIPSTICK-39 may have about the LIMESA/LIMUST tnatalation,
However, the termination of a productive base such as LICALLA
would require an explanation to LIPSTICK-39 which could not help but
leave him a bit suspicious, For Headquarers information, the
local rental laws are such that LIPSTICK-39 would not be able to
comprehend why we did not insist on him maintaining “squatters
rights" (a6 stated previously, LIPSTICK-39 apparently does not
know that we own LICALLA or even have an interest in any of the
other LIMUST properties) which can easily be done in Mexico,
Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALLA might cause more
of a security problem with LIPSTICK-39 than permitting

LICALLA to operate as it is now, Another possibility would be
terminating LIPSTICK-39 and putting another agert in the present
LICALLA Base, If thts measure were followed, it would not
eliminate the fact that LIPSTICK-39, even if termtnated, would
etill know of the existance of the present LICALLA Base, Still
another possibility would be to terminate LIPSTICK-39 and the
LICALLA Base; however, since LICALLA and the other LIMUST.
Properties are ostensibly owned by one man, LIMOUSINE, suspicicas
end investigations could still lead to LIMUST,

truck, He is also used occasfonally to spot and rent operetional

' of a low level surveillance team (which was compromised and

4 was not busy with the photo truck), and as a statt surveillance
\ man (i,e,, used as an outside sentry during the March 1958

Surveillance team member) ts LIPSTICK~2's wife's nephew.
LIPSTICK-2's cover is buying and selling cars; however, about
the only business he has in this comection is when he buys and
sells cars for KUBARK. His cover {a quite weak, He recetves

&@ monthly salary of $3, 200,00 (MN) plus $600, 00 (MN) per month
for the use of his personal car.

LIPSTICK~24 docs not know GERENDE and, presumably, knows
only LIPSTICK-2, with whom he works on the photo truck, His
cover {s as a salesman of electrical appliances; however, he

does not pursue his cover job to the desirable extent, LIPSTICK-24
was recruited by LIPSTICK~-2 about one year ago and {a currently
recetving a salary of $1,000.00 (MN) per month, Since he has

now worked a year for the Station, and performed satisfactorily,
hte salary should be ratsed to $1, 200,00 (MN) per month (LIEMPTY
will provide for this increase),

(3) Communications - GERENDE meets LIPSTICK-2|

week, These meetings are ees

LIPSTICK-2 also knowa GERENDE's true name, where he ves, and
hia phone number, In the past he haa had occaston.
GERENDE at the latter's home, LIPSTICK-2 know jand
could, in an emergency situation, contact] However,
GERENDE has been tnetructed to arrange a complete communtca-
ttons plan with LIPSTICK-2, tncluding a reserve meang of contact,
For securtty reasons, GERENDE has been instructed to inform
LIPSTICK=2 that his only contact ig with GERENDE and that in
the future he ts vot tocontact anyone else tn the organization
without GERENDE's permission, Also, that should contact with
GERENDE be disrupted, he ts to await for the higher echelon to
establish contact with him (all agents under GERENDE are being
instructed), This ts particularly important in the case of
‘tpstick-2, since he has by-passed GERENDE tn two or three
in the past.

(4) | Securtty- Probably the most serious security situation
involving the photo truck, LIPSTICK=2 and Lipstick-24 ta the
basic knowledge of the LIPSTICK surveillance team that such an
@aset exists, even to the point that one of the team members
LIPSTICK~34) is the listed owner of the photo truck, The personal
knowledge of LIPSTICK~2 about the LIFEAT operation also represents
a security hazard of the first class, For example, if LIPSTICK-2
were compromised and arrested as a result of his activities,
there {s a possibility that he could compromise his brother,
LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE
and our interest in the highly sensitive LIMESA/LIMUST operation,
(NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and the former
LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICK-2 have
been reminded on several occasions during the past few years
that they were not to discuss any aspect of their operations with
each other, Also, LIPSTICK~-2, to the best of the Station's

A new truck should be purchased as soon as possible to reph:ze
the present truck, The new truck should be purchased in an

have no contact with LIPSTICK-14 or any other uperational
Personnel he may know except, of course, LIPSTICK-24,

with whom he works, and GERENDE, who supervises his
acttivittes, in addition to the above, the Statton should begin
thinking about a replacement agent for LIPSTICK-2 and every
effort whould be made to set up an independent and compartmented
photo truck operation, Thia‘would'‘permitthe eventiial termination
of LIPSTICK-2, after we have given him several months to
reduce his knowledge of current operations,

LIJERSEY

(1) ‘Terget - Foot survetllance and investigative support of
other Batiot operations,

(2) Personnel - LIJERSEY~4 ts of a low social class and
lives with his mother in a slum area of Mexico City. He ta

the sole support for his mother and several younger brothers

and sisters, He ts described by GERENDE as having a lot of
ambition and a strong desire to tmprove his standard of living

and position in Hfe, The Station has found him to be a good
observer and, consequently, adequate for static surveillance
work, Although he now has his drivers license, he ts not a
capable driver and probably will never develop into one,
GERENDE hae been encouraging LIERSEY-4 to obtain employment
as a salesman to supplement his KUBARK income of $1, 000,00
(MN) and to establish himself in a cover job, However, LIJERSEY-4
has not yet obtained such employment, It is ‘the Station's

opinion that LJERSEY-4 ts definirely an asset of limited value

and will never develop into the high-calibre survetllance asset
which the Station really needs,

LIJERSEY-8's struation ts about the same as LIJERSEY-4's,

He lives with his family and is currently taking highschool

courses (LIJERSEY~4 is dotng the same), He is not an imaginative
talker and has difficulty making up cover stories and spur~of-the-
momen excuses and explanaticns - the vital qualifications for a
good surveillance man, He is the best driver of the three LIERSEY

LIJERSEY-13 does not know LIJERSEYS-4 and 8 and vice versa,
LIJERSEY-13 ts better dressed than the other two team members
and can pass ag a better educated and more goctally flexible

tavestigation assignments with facility and imagination and ts |
adept at nuking up cover stortes. In brief, he makes a good H
impression on the people he interviews, He (s not a good
driver and is too nervous to develop into one, His salary is
$1,000, 00 (MN) per month,

(4 Security - Insofar as knowledge of other operations,
personnel aad assets is Bdnisrag LIJERSEYS appear to have
the best security of any of the operations handled by GERENDE,
New communications plans with the LJERSEYS w tll do much
toward increasing security and ability to meet contingencies,
GERENDE will be instructed to give refresher training to all

three LIJERSEYS tn operational security, cover and communications,
The major danger existing with the LIERSEY team, and with any
surveiilance team, is the possibility of compromise and arrest

by owe of the local police agencies, Should this happen, GERENDE
and his other operations would be placed in constderable danger,

SECRET



SECRET

For this re2son, {r ta not advisable to have GERENDE

connected with a surveillance team and zizo contacting and
directing the scnsitive photo base houres, Therefore, untll such
time es a cultable asset can be developed or acquired to take over
the LJERSZY team, their actual survetllance aesignments will
be kept at che mtaimum,

(53) Recommendations ~ It is suggested that the LIJERSEY
framework be uscd for the recruitment cf at least three competent

and higher claes local nationals for use ca surveillance sasign-

ments, After the recruitment of such tndividuals, tt may be
suggested that LIJERSEYS-4 and 8 be terminated, LIJERSEY-13 should
remetn as an independent investigative asset to conduct “credit”

and other type of inquiries which he ¢an co without help from

other agents, LIJERSEY~S has already been asked to spot

prospective candidates of a higher social standing for use ona

new surveillance team; however, even under optimum conditions,

one and a half years will be required to get such a team functtoning.

In order to recrutt the type of team member that will be most
worthwhile to the Station, we must plan to pay a minimum starting
salary of $1, 600,00 (MN) per month, The cost of Hving tn

Mextco is continually on the rise and where $1, 000,00 (MN)

was a good salary one to two years ago, it really is not adequate today,

to facilitate the readers’ overall comprehenston,

a Conttaue the reorganization cf communication arrangements

C Continue to use GERENDE for the time being as the principal
agent in charge of LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA, the Photo Truck,
LIJERSEY, LIMITATIONS-5 and 6, and LIPSTICKS 38 and 40,

a Arrange a warning system of communications fer removing
GERENDE to PBPRIME should he be compromised to one of the local
police agenctes,

e Purchase a new photo truck for use by LIPSTICKS 2 and 24,

ft. Begin planning for a compartmented photo truck operation

surveillance team,

h, Eventually separate GERENDE from either LIJERSEY surveillance
team duties or the three photographic base houses, preferably the former,
The two rypes ef activities are not compatible with each other end should
not be handled by the same principal agent,

t. Implied, but not specifically stated elacwhere in this paper,

{a the suggestion that GERENDE be given a "cooling off" and training

period of nwo to three months in PUPRIME, Of course, this will not

be possible until other agsets are developed to take over GERENDE'B

present duties, After his retumm from PBPRIME, GERENDE could be

used to develop new support assets which would be completely compartmented
from all of his previous operations, personnel and activittes,

6, | CONCLUSIONS
tt would take several weeks of uninterrupted study of files to write a
really comprehensive security review of GERENDE's operations and activities,
However, based on the facts contained in this paper, it ts the Station's opinion
that GEREXDE probably ta not now known to the local police ageacics as a
KUBARK or PRPRIME agent, It is belteved that GERENDE could be tdenttfied
by the local police agencies at any time they choose to interrogate LIPSTICKS=12
and 30 in detail or when one of the other agent assets formerly or curreatly
ageoctated wil: GERENDE ts compromised, Furthermore, if GERENDE ta
arrested, he could compromise most of the Station's support assets, plus the
BGMORNING and Cuban Exiles portions of LIFEAT,

Gtvea several months time, the slow process of compartmentarion
can be introduced tnto GERENDE's operations, Such compartmentation, however,
wlll never reach the truly desirable point, but some tmprovement over the
exiting situation can be made, If GERENDE can emerge basically unscathed
from the current incidents, then KUBARK will have an extremely valuable
long-range support asset.

MEMOUAIOUM FOR: WH/ITT/Mexico
SUBJECTS Paymond He GEZENDE
REFEKERCE: HOR-11368

1, This dispatch represents the type of operational eee
we need, I think any answer to the Station should lead. of:
expression of appreciation for @ good job. Maybe it Mises
thez to write more of this type.

a2
exes

use@er. wery exposed and should be taken off sone of hiBe ese esyNysiiieacse)

 OERENDE 19
baat oncas Specifically, ay ideas are as follove:

3. Re para. 3 a, agent is very capable and should be retained
Af secure means can be found, Getting rid of hin vould not solve the
Problez, 4s long as he is in Mexico he is vulnerable, Some thought
Should be given to how ha would be supported in the event of arrest.
Personally, I believe the Station would do better to sacrifice a case
officer than permit things to drag on to the point where GERENDE might
tell all to the police,

Recommendations: '

&, GEREXDE be briefed so as to be ever reacy with an innocuous
story to tell the police in the event of arrest.

b, Gi 1d to contact one of already blown Station
officers Lik jin the event of arrest ond that the Station
officer be ready pear personally at police station to free
GEPENDE. Lf the case officer naned for this ¢zty and G=PS\DR

both know the innocuous cover story, there shoild be little probles,
Ihave done it myself, A good cover story is "looking for draft
dodgers" or some such tale which does not have implications of ;
working against Mexican citizens. 7

¢. ‘That if not allowed to communicate directly GERENDE should
tell the senior officer present at poli: that he vorks :
on (cover story) for insists| sent for.

da. That a second blown case officer's name be given as an
alternate for| jwho is often out of toxn and unavailable.



@, That GERENDE ba taken off LIFZAT at once and all
suspicious audio equipment be renoved from his home or officas.
At present, LIFZAT is the cnly illegal activity being engaged
in by GERENDE; if he is made merely in connection with his
physical surveillance activities he is not likely to be hurt
by the Hexicans,

f, Concur preparations should be made to hide out GEREXDE
if it is known he is to be arrested.

4, Re para. a, GERENDE's participation in LDOTED is 0. X,
I believe no law is being broken, However, LIMITED is probably blom
to the Soviets, Heris the more real danger, Station should find out
who is the registered owner of the phone at LIMITED, Prior to leaving
Mexico TI noted to it was still held in the name of LIM=STONS-3
(now fired and hence a possible threat).

5. Re para, 4 bs This is the same situation as LIMITED but not
80 likely blown to the Soviets, There 1s no reason why GERENDZ should
not continue this work,

6, Re para, hc, LICALLA is a very special problem and should
be taken up at once with Headquarters elements working on LIMESs/LIMUST.
I thought LICALLA had been cancelled out when LIGSA began to shape up,
I consider it a danger to LIMESA, Has LICALLA produced anything of
value? I think we could vacata-this in such a way that the agents in
LICALLA would have no cause to be suspicious, (Put an obvious tail on
the agent, scare him off, etc. This would throw off the Mexican police,
too, in the event they are alresdy Wise to LICALLA through LIPSTICK L7.
We could pretend to believe the Soviets ran the tail and the gane is up,)

Recommendation: Get rid of LICALLA unless very productive, Better
do this before the remodeling begins,

7. Re para ld, photo truck, LIPSTICK-2 does know of the locations
of sone of the baschouses on LIFEAT since he was a Line inspector,

Recommendations:

a, New compartmented truck should be set up, Don't use false
mames and addresses. It could result in great harm.

b._ LIPSTICK-2 be sent off to some small town as “resident
agent® for general work and to get him ont of the area.

think it consistent for GEREWDE to handle it,

9. Re para.  f: GUREXDE should be taken off LIFZAT at once,
even if it means losing lines, As of March this year the Station
had enough agent persorrel to handie bases for 2h lines, They should
be able to fill the gap even though LDGSTON~3 and his tribe ware

Instructor, Poreign 7raineos

Evaluation of trainee in Special Project LIPSTICK

1. Instruction 4a this project commenced 10 June and was
concluded 12 July 1957. It covered tradecraft, observation,
description, casing ant reporting, principles of CEWI, elicitation
and interviewing, investigative techniques, and TS$ briefings in
photo and the use of recording nachine

2. Trainee was knam as "Rey", He was easy to work with.
Be was always pleasant, courteous, cheerful and eeemed genuinely
interested in every phase of the training. »Be.can-speak;* read and”
write English without my difficulty.

3. Ray sooned voll motivated; more Pro-Anerican than Vexican.
So posseses a strong izterest in clandestine work. He is an avid
reader. He demonstrated ability to apply principles he had leamed
from reading eni study, He sooned possessed of initiativa although
there was a limited opportunity of observing this quality in action.

4. While Pay's duties to date apparently have not given hima
wide and varied experience in clandestine activity, he seened to
grasp the waterial quite readily; and although in the field of
CI“CE he scated he had never thought of many of their aspects as
applying to hin, he seened glad of the opportunity to leam and
absorbed then quite readily. He now possesses a good working
Amowledge of fundamental principles involved. However, it is felt
that if he is to work primarily in this field, it should be under
the supervision of a case officer with considerable experience and
background in this type of activity.

5. As previously isdicated, Ray was an avid reader. In addi-
tion to certain case stulies, be read the following books:

"Handbook for Spies"

"The Spy veb*

"Out of Bondage®

"London Calling North Pole®
"A Spy Has Mo Friends”

SECRET sh

ec Seea nthe Se oe atin tue en I EAA ODOM ASS OIE rd



The following filzs were exhibited and critiqued:

*House Search”
*Surveillance®
"Zody Search®
"Under Cover®

6. It is felt that Pay benefitted considerably from this
course of instruction. We feel that his concept and understand=
dng of principles of clandestine activity have been broadened
and strengthened. His interest, enthusiasm and production should
reflect this in his future work.
