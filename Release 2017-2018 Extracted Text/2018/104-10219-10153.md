ACTION REQUALD. HLVERENCES

Reference: IAMN-12204 dated 24 Jarmary 196%

Station Mexico City fully agrecs with Hendquarters evaluacion of Subject as

a "valuable long tern asset with stay behind potential."

In order to place the matter

1n the apropriate frame of reierence it 1s felt scat a few back-

ground points should be noted.

In Jemary 1956 the LINITY/LILYNIC baseiouse was set up end placed in operation

15 a site wilch provided visial coremye of the LICK Installation. A deposit of

three months rent was node per terra of the rental contrect at tha: tine (2,160 pesos.)

In April 1961 the building in which LIMPTY/LILYRIC 18 Located was

sold by the owner.

Piorrally tle rental deposit wouls here been trnsferred to the rew ciner as part of

However, epproximately tirce months after the transfer of the

property to the new oner, the renial doposit was returned to the basehouse operator,

The dejosit was then returned to OBRENDE, GRINDE did not infor the

then LIarY case officer nor the present case officer of the retir of the LIMPTY/

LILMIC deposit. Tis 2,100 pesos cortinued to be carried on the jetion boots as

On 16 October 1953 OERNDE returned the 2,100 posos to the case officer and the

Station res. adjusted its books to reilect the return of this money. ORLDS noted

at the tine of the return that he lad this noney intact but did no: inow how to 8o

about returning it so long after raving received it.

This la the sane as he stated at

of the ICFLUTTER Interview. GRENDE has Obviously ingressed with his 1nab111ty

to "beat" the ICFLUTTER. He was sincerely remorseful when talking to the case officer

about the incident and has twice stated that nothing of thin nature vould happen again.

With the reality of suture LOPINTER teste

set firaly in ORED2's mind, 1t 18 belleved

that he will not atreapt any such action again.

As to what can be done of a positive nature (other than perfoile re-ICPIUITER) to

prevent recutence it Just be roted that GlE kept ejart the s lor preon whieh were

really still charged to hig and the Statior had no waj o! knowin; t'et the nores tai

been returned to bis by the bestsoisedeeper.

Only when the close soon of the lsdr!

LILYRIC barchouse sould be effectel wani the Statlon exject to haie the rental deposie

Until such tige the deposit would remain crarzed to canaida.

The only way

to completely safeguard against this type of action vould be for the case officer to

meet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby eliairatine G339,03 Iron the operetlor

and causing unaccepteble security risks.

It la belleved that periodie ICPLUTTER 0E

GEKENDE 18 the best insuranco against a slailar occurence in the future.

As to GERSIDE's regular operational revolving fund, Irregularities have never

been discovered in his handling of these funda. Cash counts are colucted b. the

case officer to control the uispent portion of tho revoliing lund by coparison vith

accountings (receipts) GIM: -aies every ewo weeks.

GOURDE's revolving fund 15

kept at the minims agount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for vich

OBRINDE 1s responsible.

The "other false claims" ORINDE admitted making involved occasional use of his

@ vehicle for personal drivino wile entering all recelpts for gas on his KUlARK

accountings, Station does not consider this a major problem. If GANDS used hie

car for only operational employment any hostile surveillance of him vould be relatively

easy (1.0o, surveilling only when he is using his l' vehicle) and it 13 belleved that

latitude must be allowed in this arca for indigenous agents.

In the area of OERENDE's morale and his statement that he "Is not being

ut1lized to his full potential" the station 19 as fully concerned as Headquarterg.

It

should be noted however, that GaUNDE has never vritten the report setting forth biat

he thinks he can do and thon proided on this has stated that he had been thinking about

what additional work he could assume and that ho "just does not know". The reason ho

gives is he does not know what alce la being done in the operations aren other than that

to wnich ho lo already exposed. Alditional operational work 10 assigned to abRina

when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations.

An example of this vas his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station 1s reluctant

to expose O'H-ITE to additional operations anly for the purpose of Improving bis corale"

since he alroady has considerable knowledge of uny Station past and going operations.

The Station appreciates Hcarqunners coments on the resulta of GRaNDE's LOTLUITER

and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GRaDE in

the future.

of Project LIEMPTY wherein GERENDE's dutles were specifled.

3. It is requested that Headquarters Intriate an approprlate amend-

In compliance with the KUBARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60,

Annex A, concerning contact arrangments under emergency conditions, the

following information, Including recognition signals and bona fides, Is

forwarded for Headquarters records. Due to the sensitivity of the information,

it was believed more appropriate to forward it separately rather than to

include ir with reference (Request for Renewal of Project LlEMPTY).

2. Insofar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could

probably be contacted at one of the following places:

a. Present Residence: IDENTITY A

b. Mother's Residence: IDENTITY B

c. Cover Employment Address: IDENTITY C

3. The following oral recognition signals, using the English language,

are to be used as indicated:

and Uncle."

GERENDE: "Then you are referring to the IDENTITY D. "

CONTACT: "No, I am referring to your other relatives in

South Carolina, the IDENTITY E

GERENDE: "Yes, Auntie Is my Mother's sister. "

4. For use as physical bona fides, the Station is forwarding a one peso

note with the serial number T348510 for Headquarters files. GERENDE has

been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number, T348511, to

keep in a safe place pending his having to show it to some furure KUBARK contact.

It has been explained to GERENDE that he is to show his half of the physical

bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and

accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see his physical bona

fides. GERENDE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contact's

bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510).

5. Assuming that adequare time will be avallable at the beginning of an

emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret

Writing so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY D or E

addresses.-

FIRENCE;S)

A.

HMMA - 13063, 5 June 1959.

HMMW-7959, i2 August 1959.

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment No. One is GERINDE's signed

contract amendment. GERENDE is most appreciative for the raise in salary

and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment claus:.

The Station interprets the Terminal Paynent clauss to mean any

termination by the Government or acceptance uf GERENDE's restination in

the "beat interests of the Government."

Examples in connection with the "best

interests of the Government" Interpretation would involve GERENDE's resignation

for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a clunge of residence

to some geographical area where hig services could noi be utilizid by KUBARK.

Assuming thai no securiry problems are involved in making such & payment, the

Station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to CERENDE's estate

in the event of his death while in the ciploy of KUBARK.

3. The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as

originally requested and concurs in Heauquarters reasoning. Certainly, the Station

would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he has been so informed,

it he elecis to resign just to reccive some extra money or to pursue some other

carcer. The Siation hastens to add, however, that to the best of its knowledge,

GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK Job.

4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No. Two are the

original and one copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957. Head-

quarters wili note that the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved by

the Chief of Station, but was not formally witnessed, I is suggested that

who is presently in Headquarters, be requested to witness the

document.

amendment became effective.

Headguarters preparation of a new contract.

HMMW-5626, 3 December 1957

1.

1955 under provisions of an oral agreement. Effective 1 October 1955 GERENDE

was placed under a written contract, prepared by Headquarters, with an annual

salary of $3, 000.00. On 1 September 1957 his contract was amended to increase

his salary to $1, 080.00 per annun:, which is the salary he is presently receiving.

It Is requested that a new iwo year con raci be prepared, to be effective 1 July 1959,

providing an increase in salary to $4,500.00 per annum and including a termination

clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one month's salary,

calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for

each full year of his KUBARK employment.

All other provisions of GERENDE's

Initial contraci should remain in force. (The increase in salary to $1, 5ó0. 00

per annuin is already covered by the LIEMPTY Projeci.)

2. As pointed out in the attachment to HMMA-11368, 22 Ocruber 1958,

paragraph three of MEXI-2336, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Pield

Projeci Outline, GERENDE is a highly valued full-time Station assct who carries

a significant work load and who has a great deal of responsibility. He is :he

LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA hase

houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans-

lation service and all the agents participating in these activities. He performa

his dutles in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent

abilities are showing continued improvement.

3. Paragraph eight of HMMA-12095, 4 February 1959, indicated that the

Statton was considering amending GEREVDE's contract to provide for some type

of retirement benefits.

Although it is Iccognized that indigenous agents are not

usually granted such contract provisions, the Station believes that GERENDE should

have monetary incentive, in addition to his idealogy, to make a long career with

KUBARK. Accordingly, the Station recommends that GERENDE's new contract

provide for a rermination settlement of one month's salary for each full year that

le has worked for KUBARK.

In other words, should GERENDE's career with

KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this period is $3,000. 0..

then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum payment of $16,000.00. After

considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow account and several

other ideas, the Station considers the above proposal to come closest to meeting

the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make

KUBARK acarcer. The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date

for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits.

OPERATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW OF

KAYMOND R. GENENDEYS

OPERATIONS AND ACTIVTTTES

SITUATION

assumed contact responstbltrica with GERENDE on 2 July 1958.

+27491

July 1958. the Chlet of Stiton decided tha

should be assined

permanent responsibiltry for the management and handling of GERENDE and

GEKENDE'a operartoas.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this operational securtly revlew is threefold:

To Idently posible security problems and conditions;

To establisa a framework for recommendarions which will

result in the Station's submiasion of a new support project

(LIEMPTY) with Raymond H. GERENDE as a principal agent; and

To acquatnt the new case officer with the operational problems

and agent personnel with which be should have a comprchensive

knowledge aind detalled understanding.

3.

PRINCIPAL AGENT - Raymond H. GERENDE

Background - GERENDE has been employed by KUBARK since

Is March 1955, which was Just prior to his graduarton from the Mexico

City College. He is now only 24 years of age, but in the Station's opinion,

is a mature, experienced and dedicated KUBARK contrect agent. During

the three and one-half years that he has been working for the Mexico

City Station, GERENDE has participated in a varied assortment ni support

and intelligence operations. Intrially, he was tratned and used

as a member of the LIPSTICK survetilance team, In addition,

to survellance work, he was used as an investigator to collect operational

data on persons and organizations of interest to the Starlon. He quickly

demonstrated a capaciry for leadership and at one time was the leader of

the LIPSTICK team. He has been used aB & LIFEAT Base House operator

and processor of tapes; he has crcelled In thia tune if work because of

his bl-lingual Spontsh/ English facily and, more Importantly, due to

his diversified expertence in clandestine operattons which permits him

so spor operational leads much more readlly than the average LIFEAT

monitor.

Dutles - GERENDE la currently serving as the principal agent

In charge of LIMITED, LICALIA, LIPSTICK Photo Truck, LIJERSEY

Surveillance Team and LILYRIC.

In addition, he montiors and processes

the EGMORNING and Cuban Extes LIFEAT taps. He alao supervisea

the photographic processing of LIPSTICK-38 (his brother-tn-law) and the

translatlon work of LIPSTICK-40 (nis atater). He maintains contact with

and provides administrative support to LIMITATIUNS 5 and 6, LIOOOL-7

Base operators. Quie obvlously GERENDE's many dirtes overlap the

bounds of several Station operarions, namely LIPSTICK, LUERSEY.

LIFEAT, LIOOOL and several activites which are nor listed under

wir: formal projects such as BGMORNING, It is recognized by the Station

that it is not advisable to have one principal agent connected with as

many operarlons as 1s GERENDE. However, the present scarcity of

both staff and contract agente of the principal agent type neceastiate

such efficlency measures. Every effort is being made to compartment

the varlous segments of GERENDE's operations and to decrease, and

to elimtnate where posalble, all lateral communications between

agents.

ecurity Problems • The most serlous security situatio

surrounding CERENDE and his many activiries is the fact tha

LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the LIPSTICK Team members arrested

ta the June 1958 Nap) know GERENDE by true name, and knew that he

also worked fur KUBARK: In iact, LIPSTICK-30 is a close personal

friend of GERENDE's and was originally recommended for KUBARK

employment by GERENDE. The operatonal security hypothests that

can be constructed from these existing acquaintances are too numerous

to list in this brief review, suffice to say that should GERENDE be

arresied by one of the local police agencies, most of the remaining

support asacts would be destroyed or so serlously compromised that

the Starion would indeed be foolish to conttnue using them. It ts

appropriate to stare here, however, that netther GERENDE nor the

Starion believes that GERENDE has yet been named or otherwise

Identified as a result of the LIPSTICK flap. It ly granted though that

any future questiona by one of the local police agencies to the compro

mised LIPSTICKERS represents a continuing type of danger for GERENDE,

Based on the duties which GERENDE is currently performing, the readers

of this revlew can well Imagine what the consequences to several operations

would be ll GERENDE were arrested by one of the local police agencies

and Inierrogated in detall. Also, the Stailon must forever be aware ua

the Incal police ngencles are certalaly capable, for only a lew dollars, o

selling informarion concerning KUBARK t0 the Soviets and/or Satellties.

Recommendations - It would be unwise to consider terminating

GERENDE since he is a highly compercht agent and since his termination

would not eliminate the fact that he knows a great deal abou the Starton's

support opcrations. He has becn reminded several times, and the Case

Officer wUll conttnue to remind him, that his tradecraft proissionalism

must Improve and stay ahead of the Ircreasing sophistication of the local

police agencles and oppostiton services operating in Mexico.

* It is the opinion of the Starton that GERENDE should continue

to be used in about the same manner that he li predently being used, Is

would be advisable, however, to separate him from the two Life easts

fumcttons -he la currently handling, BGMORNING and the Oüban Exile

taps. This is suggested nor only because of the possible future securly

ramificitions, bur also because GERENDE does not have time to run

properly ble aupport mechantam and to monitor laps seven days a week.

To provide for a situation whereby one of the local pollce

agencles becomes aware of GERENDE'& Illegal activities and assuming

that elther CERENDE or the Station leamns of thia before the local police

agency can take postiive action, it is imperative that a warning system

of communications be estabilahed to luciliate GERENDE's removal

from Muxico.

Arrangements such as those used for

could be set up or local arrangements could be made With ULUNIT Or

ODOATH for a more expedirious exti from Mexico. The Case Officer

will develop this plan in detall.

date he decided to reslyn from his LIMITED job and, arange

prepared to use thia cover story should they ever be apprehended

together.

LIPSTICK-14 was instructed on 8 August 1958 to cease all

social and business contact with LIPSTICK-2. l

who has previously handled LIPSTICK-14 and seeg

him occasionally even now, has been directed to cease all

contact with the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14 except when

38 and 40, and all of these individuals have a close connectien

with the operation of the Base.

The only tie-in the LILYRIC Base

something happen to GERENDE. However, to facilitate proper

and secure communications procedures, GERENDE has been

directed to establish a reserve system of communications with

Lipstick-39, using the customary oral and physical bonatides.

(1) Security- The most serious securly problem concerning

LICALLA Is the fact that LIPSTICK-39 is the brother of

LIPSTICK-47 |

Although it ta generally

believed by Station officers that LIPSTICK-39'e name was not

mentioned by LIPSTICK-47 nor that any indication was given

concerning LIPSTICK-39's Job, it must be understood that

should the local police agency decide later to interrogate

LIPSTICK-47, the probability exista of compromising LIPSTICK-39

and LICALLA, The Starion sees no way to overcome this

possiblity.

It le Important to note here that LICALLA occuples one of the four

LIMUST properties,

While it te believed that LIPSTICK-39 does

not know that KUBARK owns the Base or has anything to do wich

the other three houses, il le entirely concelvable thai should one

of the local police agencies or the LIMLAICK pirsonnel become

aware of LICALLA activities, they could very eastly arrive ar

some logical conclustons about all of the LLMUST property, Thie

would be detrimental, lí no: lainl, to our aims. However,

another Starlor viewpoint on thie same problem is that if compromised,

LICALLA would divert suspicion from, rather than 1o, LIMUST.

Should one of the local police agenctes begta an Invesilgatton which

mighi tavolve LIMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be

sacrificed to protect the LIMUST Base. These possibilities

become somewhar theoretical and perhaps impractical due

to the lack of predicilbllity of the local polfeengencies, but neverthe.

less must be welghed one agatnet the other.

In view of the apparent importance of the LIMESA/LIMUST

operation a lor of thought and discussion have transptrer at the

Station about co tinuing the LICALLA operation in lls presens

location or suspending it fur the immediate future and attempting

to find another suitable locerion away from the LIMUST property.

A sound argument can be made for termlating the base since such

an alemative might have the effect of limiring any knowledge

LIPSTICK-39 may have about the LIMESA/LIMUST Installation.

However, the terminarion of a produciive base such as LICALLA

would require an explanation to LIPSTICK-39 which could not help bur

leave him a bit suspicious. For Headquaners Information, the

local rental laws are such that LIPSTICK-39 would not be able to

comprehend why we did nor insist on him maintaning " squatters

righia" (as stated prevlously, LIPSTICX-39 apparently does nor

know that we own LiCALLA or even have an interest in any of the

other LIMUST properttes which can eastly be done in Mexico.

Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALLA mighi cause more

of a security problem with LIPSTICK-39 than permuring

LICALLA to operate as it is now. Another posstbiltry would be

terminaring LIPSTICK-39 and putting another ager? in the present

LICALLA Base. I this measure were followed, is would nor

elimtnate the fact that LIPSTICK-39, even if terminased, would

still know of the extstance of the present LICALLA Base. Still

another possibllty would be to terminate LIPSTICK-39 and the

LICALLA Base; however, since LICALLA and the other LIMUST

properties are ostensthly owned by one man, LIMOUSINE, suspicions

and investigatlong could still lead to LIMUST.

seycral years. At the present time LIPSTICK-2 la responsible

for the day to day operation of the photogruphic survetllance

In the past, LIPSTICK-2 has served as ream leader

of a low level survelllance team (which was compromised and

subeequently disbandod), as a LIFEAT line Inspector (when he

was not busy with the photo truck), and as a start survetllance

man (Le., used as an outside sentry during the March 1958

entry of the LIMUST Base by KUTUBE/D, KURIOT and KUCLUB

rechnicians. (NOTE: LIPSTICK-2 was assigned the sask of

watching the entre area during the day for any unusual acrivity

on the part of target persornel.

He was not told that he was to

watch a spectfic house. He was dismissed from his stalle sur

velllance before dusk and the Headquarters technicians did not

enter LIMUST until after 2030 bours.) LIPSTICK-2 Le the brother

without GEKENDE's permisston, Also, that should contact with

GERENDE be disrupted, he le to awalt for the higher echelon to

go instructed). This ta particularly imporiant in the case of

ipstick, since he has by-passed GERENDE in two or three

Instances in the past.

Security - Probably the most serlous security struation

Involving the photo truck, LIPSTICK-2 and Lipstick-24 is the

basic knowledge of the LIPSTICK survelllance team that such an

asset extets, even to the potni that one of the team members

(LIPSTICK-34) is the listed owner of the photo truck. The personal

knowledge of LIPSTICK-2 about the LIFEAT operaiion also represente

a security hazard of the first class. For example, if LIPSTICK-2

were compromtsed and arrested as a result of his activities,

there in a possibiliry that he could compromise his brother,

LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE

and our interest in the highly sensitive LIMESA/LIMUST operation,

(NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and the former

LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICK-2 have

been reminded on several occasions during the past few years

that they were not to diacuss any aspect of their operations with

have no contact with LIPSTICK-14 or any other uperational

personnel he may know except, of course, LIPSTICK-24,

with wisom he works, and GERENDE, who supervises hla

activlites. In addiion to the above, the Statton should begin

thinking about a replacement agent for LIFSTICK-2 and every

effort should be made to set up an independent and compartmented

photo truck operation, Thia would permit the eventual termination

of LIPSTICK-2, after we have given him several months to

reduce lila knowledge of current operations.

LIJERSEY

(1) Terge - Foot survelllance and Investigative support of

other Station operations.

Personnel - LIJERSEY-4 lu of a low social class and

Itves with his mother in a slum area of Mexico City. He la

the sole support for his mother and several younger brothers

and sisters.

He la described by GERENDE as having a lot of

ambition and a strong desire to improve hts standard of living

and poeition in life. The Station has found him to be a good

observer and, consequently, adequate for static survelllance

Although he now has his drivers license, he is not a

capable driver and probably will never develop into one.

GERENDE has been encouraging LIJERSEY-4 to obtain employment

88 a seleaman to supplement his KUBARK Inoome of $1, 000. 00

(MN) and to establish himself in a cover job. However, LIJERSEY-4

has not yet obtated such employment. It is the Starton's

opinion that LIJERSEY-4 la defintrely an asset of limited value

and will never develop Into the high-calibre survelllance asset

which the Starlon really needs.

LIJERSEY-8's struation is about the same as LAJERSEY-4'8.

He lives with his famtly and is currently taking highschool

COUTBES (LIJERSEY-4 is doing the same). He ta not an imaginative

talker and has difficulty making up cover storles and spur-of-the-

CONCLUSIONS

I would take several weeks of minterrupted study of tues to wrie a

really comprehensive security review of GERENDE's operations and activities.

Ilenwever, based on the facts contatned in this paper, li la the Station's opinion

that GERENDE probably la not now known to the local police agencies as a

KUBARK or FBPRIME agent. It is belteved that GERENDE could be Identfled

by the local police agencles at any sime they choose to Interrogate LIPSTICIS 12

and 30 in detail or when one of the other agent assets formerly or currently

assoclated with GERENDE is compromised. Furthermore, If GERENDE la

arrcated, he could compromise most of the Station's support assets, plug the

BGMORNING and Cuban Exlles portions of LIFEAT.

Given several months time, the slow procesa of compartmentarion

can be introduced into GERENDE's operations. Such compartmentation, however,

will never reach the truly desirable polni, bur some improvement over the

cxisting siruation can be made.

I GERENDE can emerge basically unscathed

from the current Incidents, then KUBARK will have an extremely valuable

Jung-range support asset.

Connur preparations should be made to hide out GERanDE

it was still held in the name of LIDSTONS 3

5. Re para. 4 bi

This is the same situation as LITED but not

so likely blam to the Soviets. There le no reason why GRaNDE should

not continue this work.

6. Re para. l C, LICAILA Is a very special problem and should

be taken up at once with Headquarters elements working on LIES: LIUST.

I thought IICALLA had been cancelled out when LIesa began to shape upo

I consider it a danger to LIMESA,

Has LICAIIA produced anything of

value? I think we could vacate this in such a lay that the agents in

LICALLA would have no cause to ba suspicious.

(Put an obrious tail on

the agent, scare him off, ete. This would throw off the Mexican solice,

too, In the event

they are already vise to LICAllA through LIPSTICK 47e

We could pretend to believe the Soviets ran the tall and the gane 18 upo)

Raco-mendation:

Get rid of LICALIA unless very productive. Better

do this before the remodeling begins.

Re para l d, photo truck. LIPSTICK? does know of the locations

of sone of the basehouses on LIFEAT since he was a line inspector.

Recommendations:

so New compartmented truck should be set up. Don't use false

names and addresses. It could result in great barm.

Do LIPSTICK 2 be sent off to sone snall town as "resident

agent. for general work and to get him out of the area.
