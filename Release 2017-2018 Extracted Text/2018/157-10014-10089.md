(Discussion off the racord.}

Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy, you havea just received the oath
from Senator Schweiker, who has now left the room, and you are
under no obligation to continua to testify in his absence, but
obviously tha Committes would appraciate it qreatly if you
would continue to testify.

Ara you willing to continue to testify in the Senator's

Mr. Tweedy. T plan to testify fully.

Mr. Baron. You are willing to tustify to tha truth as h
as you can do it?

Mr. Baron. Are you alsc awara that you may c@ase answering

questions at any point if you wish to conault with counsel?

Mr. Tweedy. T am.

Mr, Baron. Finally, areyou aware that all of your Consti-
tutional rights are intact, including your Pifth Amendment
rights to remain silent?

Mr, Tweedy. TI am,

Mr. Maron. All right, then.

Let us proceed to review a set of documents which were not

J available to us in your first examinetion. Tha attempt here

today ia not to go over a lot of old ground that we covered

in your first examination but to focus our concerns on a few

: main evanta in the alleged story of an assassination plot
against Lumumba, and to refresh your recollection by review of

these documants.

Let me introduce as Fxhibit l a cable from Allen Dulles
to the Luopoldville Station, marked for Robart Guthman on
October 26th, 1969.

(The document referred
to was marked Tweady

TESTIMONY OF BRONSON THEEDY

Mr. Haron. Wa discussed this cable in your previous

emer (Area 202) 544-6008

appearance, did wa not?

il
i Mr. Tweedy. August 26th.
|

May I correct the date? It is Auguat 26th,
Mr. Baron. Certainly.

Mx, Tweedy, It is rather important.

Mr. Baron. It is August 26th,

Mr. Tweady. Yes, wa did indeed discuss it the last time.

Mr. Baron. After you took another look at this cable

‘ this morning before we went on the Fecord, you mada a remark to
/ the effect that this cable was a source of authority as far as
you Were concerned at the time.
Ig that your impression now?
Mr. Tweedy. Yes.
Let me just add to that a bit. Tha cable per se T did not
Femenbar, but it is perfectly obvious the cable is the authori.
"When I first talked to Nr. Bissell about this, he certainly
impliad the only reason the subjact was being raised is because
it had been of national policy laval concern. 1 do not thin:
it could be more clear-cut than that. ‘This was basically, this
wan the formal expression of that by the Director himself.
T Cannot remember which came first, did 1 saa this cable
first, or did T talk to Mr. Sissal) first, [ suspect that +

talked to Mr. Hissell first. Tt must have been absolutely i:

the same tima pariod.
This merely confirmed what I think I probably h.
Mr. Bissell first.
Mr. Baron. In this discussion with Mr. Bissell, yeu are

referring to the subject of getting access to Lumumba for the

| purpose of assassination,

Mr. Tweedy. I think it probably came up in the sense that

the thrust 6f the Amatican position was that the: was no

. Solution in the Congo without the fall from powar of Mr. Lumumba,

‘and no measure should be overlooked to achiave this -- constitu-

tional, ravolutionary and indeed, executive action, {f you want
to call it that.

Mr. Baron. Meaning assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

But none of these possible measures wars excluded, and the
main point was that everybody agreed that Lumumba. had te go or
we ware in for very serious trouble in the Condo.

Me. Raron. You were referring a moment aao in discussina
this cable from AYls: Dulles to the fact that when you first
Aiscussed tha possibility ¢f assassineting tunumba as one means
of removing him from powar with Richard Bissell, Bissell rafarral
to this cabls.

Mr. Tweedy. No, I woul-l hava sean this cable whan it went
out. | am afraid you cannot pin ma down on this, because

Cannot remember the sequence of events. Tt would have bean 4

"is conceivable that thie want out before I talked to Bissell, 7

do not exclude that, but the two ware totally in tandem,

Mr. Baron, Having taken a look at all of the documents

, that we are about to introduce iate the record today, before
We begin taking your testimony on the record, ara you ‘able to
Pinpoint with any more precision your initial discussion with
Mr. Bissell of the prospect of assassinating Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. Pinpoint it in terms of time?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

4x. Tweady. No, not in terms of time. 1 can only asaums

Mr. Maron. Tt would hava taken place shortly hefore this
Allen Dulles cable?

Mr. Tweedy. Either shortly befory, or shortly after,
because the next series of cables obviously det the show, as
ft ware, on the road.

May I comment just generally on those cables as a qroun?
There are no surprises in them as far as I am concarnad, in
terms of dutail, Much of it, even to this dav, I still do not
remember.

Ona aspect emerges very clearly for me, that wa wers
careful about examining this oa ths possibilities of doina
anything against Lumumba, "asically, this whole nariod was «
series of exchangas with the field whe were seaking, as vou can

see from that cable traffic, various maasuras that might narfor>

by any means limited to-that, that we were in trouble finding

“U.S. hand hidden. It is the to and from, and the atmosphere

y of it which ds very familiar to ma; the details of it, much of

* Mr. Baron. Having refreshed your recollection by raviewiad

Wl
‘these cables, can you add any greater apecificity to the recoré

about the substance of your conversations with Richard Biasell
on the possibility of assassinating tumumba? ;

Mr. Twaady. I think what we usad to do, as [ remember it.
whan it came to tha technical axchanga with the Station on one
asset versus another, the possible security weakness of this
man veraus the possible strengths of another, Sissall left this
largely to me. I do not maan to say that we did not from tims
to’ time review it, He did not dehate with me on whethar(uhite J

she had Belaian connections, for sxample.

Mr. Baron. Back on the record on thin subject.
Mr. Tweedy. No, I do not have any further recollection of
{detailed discussions with Bissell on this. On the other hand,
it was perfectly clear that he remained actively intersated in
Tam sure that he was the one that had the idea of Justin
‘Donnell, for exampla, I think he undoubtedly came up with
J that idea. As you recall, I had forgotten untirely that Justin
‘orpornall had evar played a role in thia, 1 am sure when he
fixed on O'Ponnall the possibility tr easiet the ‘hie’ of Statice

he must have discussed this with him. 1 can almost say [

Femember it, but hardly.

Mr. Baron. Po you have any recollection of what Bissell
‘paid to you in the series of discussions on the prospect of
assassinating Lumumba about the lavel at which the exploration

of thie prospuct had beer authorized?

Mr. Tweady. No. That is the aspect I was never clear on
except thet it was parfectly clear to ma that he was quite
confide.t thet this was -~ T am now talking about the elimination
of Lumumba by whatever means. [ am not talking necessarily
about assassination; I} want to be quite clear on thet.

1 was quite clear in my mind that the policy levals of

further than that. I cannot say, for example, that Bissell
said I think as an Agency we should consider assassination on
this or that this had baen discussed with the policy levels
of government. I do not know, and it was never made clear to
-nor:does this cable make clear, but it was perfectly clear

that Mr. Dulles felt quite quiet in his mind about discussing

| any of these aspects with the State Department or the Ambassador,

Mr. Baron. Off tha record.
(Whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)
Mr. Baron.. We are back on the racord now.

When we stopped, wa ware discussing your account of your

( meetings with Richard Bissell where the subject of asaassinatinyg

; Lumumba had arisen among other means that had been considered

in dispostug of Lumumba, Did Richard Bissell ever indicate

directly or indirectly to you that ha had the authority of the

President of the United States for moving forward with an

" operation which might include assasainating Lumumba?

Me. Tweedy. Let me make it quite clear, he certainly
never mentioned the President at all.
Mr. Baron. Hy nama?

Mr. Tweedy. fy neme, or aven by any indication. It was

“merely my impression reinforced, cartainly, either befors or

after, of this cabla of Allan Dulles that this was @ policy

S level decision, but the extant to which tha Executive had

assassination discussed with him at all, I cannot comment on.

TOP SECRET



it is perfectly obvious that tha Agency felt that it had
the support of the Exacutive in efforts to eliminate Lumumba.
Te was at least my imprassion throughout this whole period that
if it avar cama down to tha point where somebody said, I think
we can do it, and we decided upon the means, that someone would
| have said, well, before we do, obviously thare haa to be final

approval. TI would not hava known where the final approval

would have come from, I would not expect that my corresporidence
twdten the Chief of Station in Laopoldville would result in the
assassination of Mr. Lumumba without further reference.

Mr. Baron, You ware under the impression that whatever
steps you were involved in toward eliminating Lumumbe, as you
put it, were fully authorized at the highest level of the
dovernment?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I was.

Mr. Baron. That would include the Prasident?

Mr. Twaedy. I do not really think I can answer that

question, Mr. Baron. Whar, somabody at my lavel, fairly senior
though it was, receives clear-cut assurancas that the policy
leval wants something done, it is vary Mifficnl® for him to
judge whether tha Prasidant per se has bean in contact with the
Agency or that he has done this through his “ational Security
Advisor, the Secretary of Stats, or whonver. Phare could be

LO way that Fo could judda that,

I think {+ would] be quite misleading if I were to try to

TOP SECRET



read into it either then or now,
Mr. Baron. Whatever impression you had of the extent of

the authority for the steps that you ware taking to eliminate

| Lumumba was derived from your conversations with Richard

Bissall?

Mr. Tweedy. And the cable.

Mr. Baron. And the cable by Allen Dulles.

\ Mr. Tweedy. Which merely indicated to me that the Agencv
waa confident that it had its policy guidance and was thus
acting accordingly.

Mr. Raron. RBatween this cable on Auaust 26th which
Allen Dulles dispatched to tha Congo and tha cahle we will now
merk Exhibit 2, which is a cable from yourself to Leopoldvills
on September 19th, marked Fyes Only, Guthman from Jadwin--

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. Were there any other meetings that you recall

] between yourself and Richard Bissell wh he asked you to

move beyond the exploratory stage to the implementation staqe
“in ansaasinating Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. I do not know at all. 1 just do not recall
that ever occurred.

Mr. Baron. Let us turn, then, to this cable.

This cable indicates -~

Mr. Tweedy. This “is the one on the 19th?

Mr. Baron. Yes.
(Discussion off the recerd.}
Mr. Baron. Back on tha record.
This cable bagina with your indication to the Chief of
Station that someone was proceading shortly to the Congo who
. | would announce himself as Sid from Paria.
First of all, to backtrack, Guthman, in this cable, is
the Chief of Station, is that right?
Mr. Tweedy. Correct.

Chief of Stetion or by hin alias, Hedamana, and Jadwin ta --

Brown. Sid Brown as a name means nothing to ma.

Mr. Baron. If I represent to you that we have had testimoay
trom S{dnayoSteLieby that thie identity atood for himself, does
| that refresh your recollection?

Mr. Tweedy. It would not surpri It was my assumption
that it probably was, but I could not recall, so I find -- in
j other words, your explanation, I think, 4a what T would hava
expected.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any independant recollection of

tet ~
dispatching Gidney Gottifel} on a mission to the Congo?
Mr. Tweedy. JT have the most unclaar racollection that 1
. ee
- discussed with Mr. Bissell Sfdnoy cote) 3 qoina *o the
Se

Congo. I hava no recollections of any conversations T had

with Mr. Gottlisbyhimself, although I am quite convinced I had

* them.

in other worda,it is inconceivable to me that he would have
gone.to the Congo without sewing me. I cannot-recall the
substance of our discussions, although I assume, and I imaai:
Mr. Bissall must have shared in this, we discussed what it was
all about, the opsrational problems involved, so that he, in
turn, could ba somewhat sensibls about what his own supportin:
rules an tnis miuat be,

When I say this, it is a rzasc.ahie assumption but it is
not direct recollection.

Mr. Baron. ‘Poxs this cable indicate to you thet you did

TOP SECRET



ch ‘S{aney*GSEETIOL™ tothe Congo on @ highly sensitive
i) mission?
Mr, Twandy. It does indeed.
When you say I dispatched him, 1 would say it would be
i) more accurate to say that Mr. Bissell and I dispatched him.
am aura the authority for him going would have come from he
rather than ma, but we arranged the datails.
Mr) Baron. Your comment about ‘the fact that the authority

4 would have flowed from Mr. Bissell diracty is borne out, is it

;l not, by Mr. Bisseli's initials on this cable?
Mr. Tweedy. Yes, exactly.
Mr. Daron. Was that a fairly unusual practices, to have
both the DDP and the Chief of the Africa Division sign a
is cable?
def Mr. Tweedy. Quite common. Throughout the organization
re ton mattars of aither particular sensitivity or so important that
}) the DDP wished to be constantly informed about correspondence
on « subjuct, the Chief of the Division would originate and
send out cables and have it actually siqned off by the DOP.
That was quite a common practice in the Agency. :
Mr. Baron, Do you have a recollection, having seen this
documant, of tha fact that you set up 4 special channel using

the YOPROP sensitivity indicator?

¢
Mr. Tweady. T did not recall ¥OPROP, but I recall special

channels.

TOP SECRET



Mr, Baron. This. would have restricted 211 traffic from
yourself to Chief of Station, is that correct?

Mx, Twaedy, Yea. My Deputy would also have access to it
“bn my absence.

Baron. That would ba Glen Fielda?

Tweedy. Yes.

Baron. Would Richard Aissell have access to it?

Tweedy. Indeed he would.

Baron. Allen Nulies also?

Tweedy. Certeiniy if he wanted, absolutely.
“Mr. Baron. Why was a snactal communications channel set
cup ia this cable?

Mr. Tweedy. Because of tha sensitivity of the subject.
This, again, was a fraquant procedure in tha Agency on sensitive

.Matters. If One was about to mount a sensitive operation, one

“of the first things normaliy done was to set up special

communications procedures so the dissemination of the messages
could be restricted to what was raquirad.

Mr, Baron. In this case, the especially sensitive subiect to
which you were restricting communications accuss was the elini-
uation of Lumumba by on means or another?

Mr. Tweedy. That is corrsct.

My. Baron. Wha wes the assignmant the-{Sidney
was to explain to the Chie! of Station wher he arrived in the

Couyo?

TOP SECRET



Mr, Tweedy. That, I do not recall, 1 can only assume

oes
that Sidney Gotthiabtwould have discussed with the Chief of

| Station instruments which TSD might have which could be of

sistance dn an aseasaination ettampt. I assumed he discussed
_ hie daventory, whatever it might be, and the two presumably were
4 trying to come to soma conclusions as to what might hava the
) bast chance or the most practical chance of being us.
: This ts my assumption, I think in this early stage, that
"vould have bean the purposa of the exercise.

Mr. Baron. Let me represent to you tha teatinony ot Sis

Gotti iebyarout two conversations that he had at Headquarters

before he undertook the mission to the Congo in Suptamhar of

1960,

First, when Ger apetitany looked at this cable and some
subsequent cablas which we will discuss today, he said thes:
cables applied to himself. He confirmed the fact that he took
a trip to the Congo and arrived on Sentember tAth as is indiceted
by a subsequent cabla, and: left on October Sth, as is indicetad
by auothar cable.

Sorel eb sa id before he left the Coneo -- i en sorry,
before he left for the Congo -- he had ¢ convaraation with you
and Glen Fields in which you instructed him ¢o tate 4 lathe)
material to the Conge and qive it to the Chie? of Station
with iastructions to assassinate Lumumba if it were Dossible

and to instruct the Chic’ of Station in the technical means hy

TOP SECRET



which this lethal material could be administered through

| Lumumba's food or toothpaste or something that he would ingest.

! Mr. CEEETLSBy also testified that in that convarsation you

| Indicated to him that these instructions ware being given at
Richard Sissell's authority.

Did that conversation take place?

(Dincussion off the record.)

Mr. Tweedy. His testimony does not basically refreah my

i memory. The only aspect of it which T would find unrealistic is

H
-lehat he had an instruction from ma to tell tha Chief of Station

“¢o use this material and qo ahead and assansinate Lumumba, as
if, i. effsct, that is all the authority Chat was necessary.
To be frank, that dows not make sansa. Tha rast of it is
.° perfectly feasible. 1 do not recall it in the detail, but 1

} am not going to deny whe (S54 said. T think his racollaction

1, Fthat T told him, in effuct, to go to the Chief of Station an
' :

sort of get the show on the road and use the poison and
assassinate Lumumba without. any further ceremony is just not th:
way it would have happened.

ur. Raror. why is that?

Mr. Tweady. For tha simple reason that. under no ciroumstes
would that dastruction hava bean given by me without referer
to highar authority up through the chain of command.

Mr. Maron. When you say reference to hicher authority,

what do you mean?

TOP SECRET



18
Tweedy. My highar authority in the first instance

Mr. Biasell.
Baron. did testify --
Twaedy. I undarstand.

Baron. =~ that you referred in your conversation with

i
him to the fact that you had authority from Mr. Bissell for the

| assignment you were giving to Gottlich.

Mr. ‘Twaedy. The only thing that Mr.-{gottIieb,would disearne
on 4s that thara would be no further reference, which hia
statement implias from Leopoldville bafore they took any action
on this matter, in other words, take the final action on this
matter, and that was navar a matter, to the bast of my recollec-
tion, that was aver delegated by Mr. Biasell. In other words.

: Mr. Bissell never said, look, you have the picture, go ahead
and do it in your own good time without any further reference

“to me or anybody else, nor is the tenor of this correspondance
a6 I read it that way at all.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall if Mr. Bissell ever want as far
as telling you that if an opportunity arose to carry off the
assassination of Lumumba in a situation where it would he
practically impossible to confirm, that there was authority
for proceeding with the assassination with Neadquarters, thet
the Chief of Station vould be, uadar those circumstances,
authorized to procasd te assassinate Lumumbe?

Mr. Tweedy. No, 1 do not.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. Do you have 4 recollection about that ons way
for the other?

Mr. Tweedy. I do not recall that he ever put it to me

{ this way.

Mr. Baron. Let us then break down your statement about this

cee

meeting with ir. Gottligbs into component parts.

You agrea now, having heard ‘Dr. Gottlieb's, testimony, thet

it t9 true that you had asked (Dr. Gottilebjte go to the Congo?

Mr. Twaady. Indeed, as I assumed T had, yes.

eee]

Mr. Baron. It is also trua that you knew that Or: Gott iieg
was to carry a lethal material to the Chiaf of Station in the
Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. If he says so, T do not disaqrew with him.

ano 8 rae

I do not frankly recall thet at thia voint, but 1 am perfectly
Wadded to accept what he says.

Mr. Baron, Assuming, for the moment, that you would have
required the Chisf of Station to check back with Headquarters
before he carriad out an assassination masion, would it be
true thet vou assigned Gocemky the task of tnatructina
the Chief of Station te essassine*s Lumutha on that basis?

ur. Tweedy. GEL Gektlie® was the head of the Technica!
Services Division, or whatever it was called in those days.

Mr. Yaron. Let me jump in for 4 moment.

At this point, for about a year anda Ralf, ha was the

Selence Advisor to Mr. Bissell, and he moved to Tachnical

TOP SECRET



cvices shortly thereafter.
Mr. Tweedy. The way you put it to me wee that I instructed
{ gto cesasainate Lumumba, The anawar to that is, tam
sure I never inatructed telie to assassinate Lumumba, This
| 4s the way you put it to me.
Me. Baron. Lat ms correct that.
What I maant to say was, would you have asked CoESTCEN
to convey the instruntion to the Chief of Station that he was
to assassinate Lumumba if ha found a way to do it and if he
confirmed it with Neadquarters?
Mr}. Twaedy. My answer to that is almest certainly not.

3 That would have been covered in other correspondynce, which |

“ think is demonstrated by thase cables, to tha Chiaf of Station

direct from me with authority of Mr. Bigsell. TI would not have

i used, neither woul@ “ir. Bissell, Mr. (ZS€€YlEs.as the channel

for this instruction.

my. Baron. Gr. GoEEYSSO} has also testified that. aside

from carrying the materials to the Chief of Station a

eructing in their use and givina him an instruction aboun «
mission to ussassinee Lumumba, thet he hat one further role
in the Congo; he wes to serves as & technical advisor to the
Chief of Stetion on ths feasibility of usina these biolosic
substdauces to carry t th oparation.

as over Epoae it, Geeiiey wes to stay down there f9

a short period of time to datermina tha technical fassipility

TOP SECRET



of the oparational plan that the Chief of Station might come

up with.

Mr. Tweedy. This ams quite reasonable to me. Presumably!

‘ with his technical knowledges of the nature of these materials

J ha would be in a position to either comment on or afvise the
| Chief of Station as he attempted to put together some kind of
operation, That makes good sense to ma.
He would require, besdeally, a technical advisor.
Nr. Baron. g0riSottliabsaleo testified that the materials
Tha took with him were of a fairly short life. Their toxicity
“would wane within a matter of waeks.
Given that bit of information to refresh your recollect (ex
“dows that make it more likely that Qotefienjwas there, to aid
the Chief of Station in actually carrying off the administration
of these drugs, 4s opposed to diving him qeneral instructions
in the use of such lethal substances?
Mr. Tweedy. I do not know really that T can commant. on
thet. ff the materials wonld deteriorate fast, the use of them
ossible, [ would stress the letter, would necessarily have
to be uxpeditied, but the overwheiming concern of Meatquarters
aud the field, again, demonstrated in this correspondance was
our coucera that this thing could ba done at all, that it be
done right, securely, aud that the U.S. hand should ba
concealed.

If this ware at odds with the life of thase materials,

TOP SECRET



1 | think that would have just been too bad. But I think it is
i

2 | parfactly clear that we would not have expedited anything at
the risk of doing Lt unprofessionally.

Mr. Baron. At the potnt that EELiab: lett for the conse
jatter talking with you, would he have been enpowered ‘to convey
i to the Chief of Station that an assassination of Lumumba could
‘be carried off if he could mast the criteria you just laid out,
concealment of the U.S. hand and use of these materials before
' ehelr potency waned?

Mr. Tweedy. My answer to that would be he would he in no
position to do anything more with the Chiaf of Station if they
reached that point in planning, that as of the last time ha

was at lleadquarters that thare would probably ba an aporovel
from Washington.

Mr. Baron. You would axpect, then, the Chief of Station

Mr. Tweedy. Only in tha most general terms. ‘lo opsretio

Mr. Tweedy. In this cable traffic, was looking at all

_of the: period between when the subjact was first broached to the
Station and that rathar indefinable period when, in effect, if
was all over, which, f suppose, basically {is the disappearance
of Lumumba.

I think all of this traffic supports my contantion thet

Leopoldville set about exploring all alleys and found none

looked mors promising than others. Individuals who miqht ba

: of n this including further operational intelligence
on the situation which might lnad to an adreamant that we would

Mr. Baron. It bagins, “Had good discussion your colleagus

: "A. Be ‘amsured did not axpact (OPRoP~ objectives
be reached in short period and understand current situation
fully warrantad return your colleague.”

And then it continues to discuas the fact that you were
{ conaidering dispatching a third country national operator and
a senior case officer from the CIA who would “run this op and
: outside agent full time under your direction.”

Doas this cable refer to ths fact that you debriefed

Sidney Gottliab?

Nr. Tweedy. Tam sure it doas. ‘That is what it must he,

Mr. Baron. The first paragraph is meant to indicate that
i the Chief of Station should not fal that Headquarters would
be disappointed in the fact that ha did not pull off an
assessination mission in such a short period of time?
Mr. Tweedy. T want to be caraful to how T raply to that.
All 1 was saying to a very profassional colleaque was thet we
hed no illusic:s about the fact that tha vianningd operation
of this would be vary difficult, at bast, and would take tims
and thoroughly agree with the fact that prospects, immadiate

prospects, wera such that there was no alternative for Si

i Uecetligh to ratur.. That is all t was seyina.

But to say what T was trving to exprass to him was ths

TOP SECRET



fact that we were not overly disappointed that Lumumba was not

assassinated at this point 49 just not the level of intercourse

that I had with a vary professional Chiéf of station. That is

fall.

Mr. Baron. Ooea not the paragraph A here indicate that

} the objective of tha mission that was discussed in the YOPROP
. v

channel was to assassinate Lumumba in view or in light of the
ete

“fact that (G6eer abyhad gone to the Congo with materials that

were only going to be lethal for a short period of time?
Mr. Tweedy, That ie what it says.

Mr. Baron. In other words, what I am trying to explore

“with you is your characterization of thin entire staqe ef the

operation as one of planning and axploration when wa know thet

2pm .
Gottlieb jtook matarialrx to the Congo which would only be lethe!

"for a short pariod of time ‘and presumably was prepared to move

“ from exploration to implementation?

Mr. Tweedy. If, as a result of the Station focusing on
the problem for the first time, as a result of Headquarters’
raquest, they had come up with 4 plan that they thouant was
exceedingly solid and which teadquarters approved, it 1s not
surprising, perhaps, that we wanted the matsrialg thare to ta’~
advantage of such, if you like, an unlikely event. But this
would not chante tha normal sequence of svents, which would bs
that the Station would explora, kaao Headquarters informed,

agreement or no agreement at all resulting from either a final
request for approval or either approval or no approval. This
would not have changed.

Mr. Baron. . Because Go ELLE" took lethal materials to

the Congo with him that had such a short: period of lethality,

ware you not contemplating at that time that the operation

| might wall move from the exploration ph to the implementation

phase just as scon as Gottliebjand Hedgeman determined that it
was feanible?

Mr. Tweedy. I think I would put it quite differantly.

I think that 1 would say that we would have bean remisa in ot
‘being in « position to uxploit, if we rnached the point where

"wa all aqreed that the thing was possible.

Tf they had merely gone over and said wa think wa can +o

‘it, by why do you not send the stuff from Headquarters, that

q
‘would have been sort of nonsense, if you follow me.

Mr. Baron. You would have expected the Chief of
Station to cable hack for confirmation, but i* was certainly
within your contemplation at the tima that when Gotti fab iwent
te the Congo, When tha Chief of Station cabled for confirme-
tion, you woul’ probably give him a qo ahea:' to essassinate
Lumumba ?

Mr. Weedy. To did set say that at all.

decision would have had to have been mda by Allen Dullas and
who else he wished to consult in Washinaton.
These are pure assumptions on my part. Under no cireum-
stancas would I have qivan the go ahead.
Mr. Dawson. That is interesting.
Mr. Baron. I just have ong more quastion on this line.
T realize we are doing very closely over this around. We woul!
not be doing it if it weren't important in trying te det you to

Would it be fair te say that whe you diapatoned Gorehi= y

TOP SECRET



Mr. Tweedy. I expected this would result in a dialogue
betwean the Station and ourselves as to what might be feasible.

Mr. Baron. You were hoping?

Mr. Tweedy, Gottilebjassisting the Chief of Station 1a
his explorations.

Mr. Daron. In view of the entire policy of the Agancy at
that time, as indicated in tha cables of Dulles and the cablas
from yourself and Bissell to the Congo, you were hoping that
@otELLebjand tha Chief of Station would find a feasible means
ef carrying out an acaagsination mission and then inform you of

that.

Mr. Tweedy. I am not going to commant on the hopa. { do

| not know what my frame of mind was on that.

Thea purpose of the exercise was to see wheather this was

ii posatbie. One thing was clear, that I was the instrumant of

: policy in carrying out the exploratian which was entirely a

professional matter. If the exploration had reached a point
whare wo felt that we could submit to higher authority a plan
which we thought made some sense, at that point highar authority
would have to take the ball and run with it and let us know
what they concludsd.

Mr, Baron. By higher authority hears, you mean any
authority highar than yourself?

Mr. Twoady. It would start with me in my chain of comm

to the President or anybody alse, I was perfectly clear in my
mind because of what had occurred and the way thet these matters
had been broached to the field by Mr. nulles, that the thing
was in the national arena and was juat not in the Agency's
arena.

What Mr. Dulles would have done and what he felt his
| authorities wera from higher authority I cannot tall you.

Mr. Pawson. That would hava been ¢ matter that would hava
\ been between Mr. Bissell and Mr. Dulles, in that correct?
Mr. Tweedy. In the first instance, it would have bean
betwaan Mr. Dulles and thy outside world, the Rxacutive.
Mr. Dawson. Tha chain of comman? would have been, you
would have talked to Hissell, you would not have been expacts'
or would have asked whet Mr. Rulles’ view wera?

Mr. Tweedy. Mind you, We were also en Agency that was
very flexible. Tt am not saying Ur. Mulles might not have talk
to me about this, that was beacause Mr. Bissell was not
immediately aveilable, or something of this kind,

What Iam saying is at the working level, tha operation:

with « plan which made professicnal sense to us which we

In other words, tha degrea to which he thought he would

Mr, Daron. It was your job to find a feasible way to carry

Mr. Tweedy. As far as I was concernad, that ia the way it
i started.

Mr. Dawson. You hava no indepandent or specific recollac-

Tweedy. Mr. Pisaull read the same traffic I did.

:

He did not want any more papar floating around in those days.
| Mr. Dulles was in even another building. Now, we were all doun
at the Reflecting Pool at that point, were we not, and Mr.
‘Dulles was on E Street. It dossn't make any difference. The
i number of papers on this EGpror thing would nave been restricted
j to the absolute minimum. 1 do not think Mr. Dulles would have

would have expected from Mr. Bissell wan progress on plannina

Mr. Dawson. Was the routing way that that information
would have begn qiven to Mr. Mullas -- for instance, what I'm
thinking was, were there staff meatings at which you attendet
with Mr. Bissell in Mr. Dulles’ praseace concerning what was
happening qanerally on @ routine quarterly or weekly basis?

Mr. Baron. Returning to the cable of October 7th, 1969,

fi
which you sant. to the Chief of Station, the referance to a

i
senior case officer who might be dispatched to the Congo, is that

a referance to the fact-that Bissell was considering dispatching

Justin O'Donnell?

Mr. Tweedy. No othar candidate, no other. I assume that

| de who it is.

Mr. Baron. O'Donnell's account that he was asked by
Bissell to go to the Congo to carry off the assassination of
Lumumba would fit here?

Mr. Tweedy. Sure.

Mr. Baron. The third country national referred to in this
cable and in other cablas aa someone you are considering
dispatching to the Congo to help with the operation, would that
be QUWIN or WIROGUR?

Mr. Twesdy. As I told you before, definitely not wROGUF.
iresumably this other fellow, whose idantity and what he was is
very, very unclear to me.

St. Baroz. The aqent that was rus by GSUTMSMEETE

Mr. Tweedy. Yes. This would have beer the man that would
have worked with Justin O'Ponnell if if had all happened.

Mr. Baron. That was QUWIN, Twill reprasaut to you that

QUWIN was the agent who wes supervised by Justin O‘Nonnell.

Mr. Tweedy. We read thet that time, which is my only

recollection of it. That is the person I am sure.

Mr. Baron. t ma correct myself here

T will represent to you that QUWIN was the aqant thet was

Is that consistent with your recollection?

Mr. Tweely. No, it is not consistant with my recollection.

i Ie ts certainly consistent with what [ raad the last time I saw
‘you, which Tt have no reason to dianute. | just cannot remember

‘the blighter at all.

Mr. Raron. As Exhibit 10, let us introduce «4 cable of
October 15th, 1960, which is not sent in the vorror channel.

Mr, Baron. This cable requests the views of the Chief of

In paragraph C, there is a reference toffiROAK.

Mr. Tweedy, wa have received the representation from the

“ CTA that that was a cryptonym used to refar to Lumumba.

I Ia that consistent with your interaptation of tha cable?

Mr. Baron, It is indeed.

Mr. Tweedy. This paragraph C says in part: “Only direct

action we can now stand behind is to support immobolizing or

ura
arresting ROAK, desirable as more definitive action might be.

" Any action taken would have to be entirely Congolese.”

How, you signed this cable, but it was Lot sant in the

Before we discuss this cable, let us also introduce inte
the record as Exhibit 11 another cabia which you eiqned on

Mr. Baron. This contains the following language: “You

Mr. Tweedy. I think by that, T think it is perfectly cod-

Mr. Baron. The cable continues --
Mr. Tweedy. Obviously that meana that everyone one talked
to said thare is no solution to the Congo as long as Lumumba

atays in a position of powar or influence there. That ie whet

; thet moans.

Mr, Baron. The cable ‘continues: “Raise above so you not
confused by any apparent duplication. This channel remains
for specific purpose you discussed with colleague and also
remains highest priority.”

Now, doug this pair of cables indicata that at this point
despite the indication in the first cable that we looked at thee
“direct action would be limited to entirely Congolese action"
the actual position of yourself and others at Headquarters
involved in this operation was that exploration of an assassine-
tion mission rumained tha highust priority for tha Chief of

Station?

Aro Fass Siento H wauninston, DC 2000)

Mr. Tweedy. I think that fa accurate.

We had come to the end of the road, at least-temporarily
on the YOPROP aspact and for the time being wa were in no
position to approve anything but: what was discussed in the

i OD
cable. Nonetheless, as long as the threat to the Congo

from Lumumba existed, there remained « high priority to search

for means to take care of the fqproP Planning aspects.
Mr. Baron. When the cable refers to the specific purpose

you discussed with colleague --

He. Tweedy. This 4s assassination with (Go

| gure.

Mr. Baron. [t then says: This purpose remains highest
j priority. Would that not indicate to the Chief of Station
" ehat ha should procaad te find « way that Lumumba could be
| assasainated?

Mr. Tweedy. What this would mean to the Chief of Station
jwaa that ha should retain exploration of possible means of
‘assassinating Lupumba as highest priority. fle should continue

to auek means to do this, not to do it.

Mr. Baron. Again, you are maintaining you have just made

yourself clear, as far as you wars concerned, you were still
"asking him to explore and not implemant at this point?

Mr, Tweedy. It would have baen restricted, but not ae

Mr. Barom. Would somebody at the Embasay conceivably
have been cut in on cable traffic in the channel that dealt with

a operations?

Mr. Tweedy. Could be, certainly. ae
Mr., Baron. In other words, tha porpose of sending a

second cable on the same day which dealt with action against

Lumumba was: what?

Mr, Tweedy. The simple reason I think -~ Y say I think,

obviously you'd coma temporarily to the and of the line on

Mr. Baron. By contrast, the YQPROP cable would only have

Mr. Tweedy. Tha Prbagey would not have been shown this
cable anyway. We do not show the traffic to the Embassy; we
discussed it.

Mr. Baron. It would have been propr for the fiiprar cable

to be conveyed {n some manner?

Mr. Tweedy. To be discussed.

Mr. Baron. Batween the Chief of station and parhaps the

Mr. Tweedy. Discussed) only orally.

Mr. Baron. By contrast, tha YOrror cable clearly would
have been restricted to the Chiaf of Station?

Mr. Tweedy. I hava no reason to believe that the YOPROP

business was discussed with the Ambassador, I do not.

believe it was, although Mr. Dulles, in his original cabie, sait

"he could, if he wanted to.

a Mr. Baron. Let us introduce as the final exhibit for

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station then makes a suggestion

in the fourth paragraph for equipment that. might be provided if

such a case officer ware to be sent. He isays, "If case officer

make rifle with telescopic sight and silencer. Hunting good

here when lights right, However as hunting rifles now forbidden.

Would you take that to be & racommendation by tha Chi

cand
"trate on the YQPROP operation, he should be provided with the

"kind of weapon that would be suited for a suipar shot at

Lumumba?
Hr. Tweedy. Yes. Not ni asarily to be fired by the
case officar, obviously not, but at least used in the operatio.:.

Mr. Baron. ‘This reference to the hunting seeson can be

taken as a reference obliquely to ths fact that Lumumba was in

UN custody and that there would not be, in effect, “opan
Season” of. him until he showed his face outside of tIN custody.
Would that be a fair interpretation?

Mr. Tweady. I would not have interpreted it quite the
Bame way. J would have interpreted it this way, which was if
it, as 4 rasult of Ileedquartars suggestion that a rifle be
providad to the Station, the Station would cons up with an
operational plan dnvolving the use of the rifle which Headdue:t-r<

would approve, and that thus, in uffact, the oparation was on
