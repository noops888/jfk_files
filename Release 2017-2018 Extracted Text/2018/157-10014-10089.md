Mx. Tweedy, August 26th.

May I corract the data? It 1a August 26th.

MI, Baron. Cartainly.

Mr. Tweedy, It is rather important.

Mr. Baron. It is August 26th.

MI. Tweady. Yes, we did indeed discus it the last time.

Mr. Baron. After you took another look at this cable

this morning bafore we went on the record, you mado a ramart to

the effect that this cable was a source of authority as far a

you wore concerned at the time.

Is that your impression now?

Mr. Twaady, Yes.

Let mo just add to that a bit. The cable per se I dir no:

remanbar, but it is perfectly obvious the cable la the authori....

Whan I first talked to MI. Bissell about this, he certainly

implied the only reason the subjact was being raisad is because

it could be more clear-cut than that, This was basically, this

Mr. Baron. In this discussion with Mi. Bissell, you are

purpose of assassination.

Mr. Tweady, I think it probably came up in the sanse that

solution in the Congo without the fall from power of Mr. Lumunha.

MI. Baror. Meaning assassination?

Mr. Daron, Back on the record on this subject.

MI. Tready, No, I do not have any further recollection of

detailed discussions with Bissell on this. On the other hand.

' It was perfoctly clear that he remained activaly interestod in

1t. I am sure that he was the one that had the idea of Justin

It 1s perfactly obvious that the Agency felt that it had

Thia 1s my assumption. I think in this early stage, that

Mr. Baron. Let me rapresent to you the tortlony of Slitt

1: Gottliabrabout two conversations that he had at learnuarters

1: 1960.

First, when Dr. Gottllaby looked at this cable and some

which this lethal material could be administered through

Mr. gottliabjaleo testified that in that conversation you

Indicated to him that these instructions were being given at

5

Richard sissell's authority.

Did that conversation take place?

(Discussion off the racord.)

Mr. Twaady. His testimony does not basically refrenh my

that ho had an instruction from me to tell the chief of statlor.

to use this material and no ahead ard assarsinate Lunumba, ar

He had come to the and of the road, at least tamporarily

on the YOPROP aspect and for the time baing ma vare in no

position to approve anything but: what was discusned in the

0?

LAP cable. Nonethalass, as long as the threat to the congo

from Lumumba axiated, thare remained a high priority to search

los means to take care of the YOPROP planning aspects.

Mr, Baron. When the cable rafara to the apecific purposa

you diacusaed with colleague -

Mr, Tweody, This 1a ansassination with

¡GOtEllab? I am

MI. Daron. It then says: thia purpose remaine highest

that he should proceed to find a way that Lumumba could bu

Mr. Tready, What this would mean to the Chiat of Station

MI.. Baron. In other vorda; the purpose of aending a

Mr. Tweedy. The simple reason I think -- I say I think.

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station then makes a suggestion

Hould you take that to be a racommendation by the Chiet

trate on the X§PROP operation, he should be provided with the

i kind of weapon that would he sulted for a snipar shot at

MI. Tweedy. Yes. Not necessarily to be fired by the

Mr. Baron. This reference to the huntina season can be

ir.

taken as a reference obliqualy to the fact that Lumumba was ir

Un custody and that thare woul not bo, in affect, "open

Would that he a fair intorpretation?

Mr. Twoody, I would not have interpreted it quite the

In other words, the point whare they knaw how it could be user

Mr. Baron. I have one othar genaral question bafore wa

take a broak, and that ls, returning to sidney cottilable

account of his conversation with Richard Bissall about making

proparations for carrying off an assassination against an

li Serican foreign leader 18 It were required, Gottilab said in
