fighting In the Black Sea Area where he described hand-to-hand combat

to be with the Naval Intelligence. He claimed that there vere two

Ground Force military type.

LEE OSWALD IN RUSSIA

(e) On 23 February 1964, as SUBJECT approached the table for
the evening meal, he noted that the Time magazine lying on the coffee
table in the living room had a picture of Marie OSWALD. As he sat
dom he hit the table with his fist and sald, "I feel that I could
have stopped OSWALD", At this point Special Agent Stanley C. LACH
asked him “how?". He proceeded to state that he (SUBJECT) was head
of the KCB Tourist and Visitors Section which kept control over the
activities of OSWALD while he vas in the Soviet Union. . He caid at
the time, OSWALD was of no special concern or interest to the KGB
2 lacked Intelligence bac! und. Therefore, when he applied
for permission to leave Russia, they (KCB) under his (SUBJECT) direction
informed OSWALD that he vould have to make his application through the
appropriate channels of the Stete Department, who in turn vould request
his release from the Russian counterparts in handling of visas. This
he said was all done for propaganda «nd show purposes, He went on to
state that if they really wanted to release OSWALD, it could have been
done cn the spur of the nonent, but since OSWALD had nothing and was
not worth anything, they decided that this was an opportunity to show
the American State Department that they did not mind releasing individ~
uals if they applied for release through the appropriate channels.
Prior to this application for release of OSWALD, the SUBJECT stated
that since he vas of no particular interest to them and there was
nothing in Moscow that they could use him for or place him into, they
ae ed that they vould send OSWALD to Hinsk where he would be placed
in a factory working on radios in the hope that seme training in the
electrical and electronic field might result in his development into
electronics engineer; however, he showed no capability in this field.
@ GUBJECT then stated t it was § at this period, before sending
OSVALD to ilinsk, that a very & ge thing happened.

SWALD was. supposed to have a meeting with a travel agent in ‘regard
to preps: tons for his going to Minsk at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
At 6 o'clock he still did not report to the travel agent, so the travel
agent decided to go to the hotel where OSWALD was staying to see if he
could locate him. When he got to the hotel he asked the clerk if OSWALD.

was in his room, the clerk nodded affirmatively, and the travel agent
proceeded to OSWALD's room. He tried the door, but the door vas loc“ed.

He knocked, got no response, and then with the assistance of the clesk *
they broke into the room and found OSWALD lying across the bed with both
of his wrists slashed. The travel agent and the clerk responded immediately
by taking OSWALD to the near-by medical facility where he was given blood
trousfusions and after a period of time regained his strength. During the
investigation the following day the SUBJECT stated that the doctor indicated
that had OSWALD not been found for approximately ten more minutes, he would
have been dead. It is here that the SUBJECT again pounded the table and
said if the travel agent had not broken into the room, but had instead
contacted the KGB office like they are instructed to when they do not

get any response from people with whom they have appointments, that he
(SUBJECT ) would have most likely directed the travel agent to forget

about him, and on the following day or later that evening he would have
sent one of the KGB agents to check on OSWALD, at which tine he would

have been found dead. This, he went on to state, is what hurts him

when he realizes that he covld have been instrumental in disposing of
OSWALD without any special inquiry or serious investigation, OSWALD

being nothing, and at the same time today the President of the United
States, President KEMEDY, would be alive. The SUBJECT then went on’ f
o state that after OSWALD was sent to Minsk it was there that he met

rie. Like hinself (OSWALD), Marie was a girl froma peasant family

with no special background and somewhat illiterate. It was because

of her poor background that she was given permission to marry OSWALD

and return to the United States as his wife.

The SUBJECT then went on to deseribe what took place on the day
that President MMEDY vas assassinated, He said that this was actually
on Saturday In Moscow, the 22nd of Noverber. He was home at the tine
ond happened to have the radio on, when he heard that the President of
the United States had been assassinated. Approximately one hour leter,
the radio informed him that the assassin was Lee OSHALD. Yhis announcement,
he said, really stunned hin. He grabbed his coat and dashed to his office.
Immediately upon his arrival he searched for the OSWALD file. When he
found the file he reviewed 4% and found that OSWALD had not been used
or even approached for use by the Russian Intelligence. He put ina
long distance call to the Chief of the KGB Section in Minsk and inquired
whether they had used, trained or prepared OSWALD in any way for intelli-
gence activity. The Chief informed him that according to what he could
recall, they had not made ony use of OSWALD. Just ebout this time, he
(SUBJECT) stated that his cuperioy walked into the office and directed

the SUBJECT to get all-the information available on OSWALD and prepare *
@ summary to be furnished the top officials of the Commnist Farty. ‘
The SUBJECT then directed the KGB Agent in Minsk to likewise prepare
a summary of his file on OSWALD and informed him that within. twenty
minutes a KGB-agent would arrive by special military plane to pick

up the summary for return to Moscow. He said this was accomplished, ©
and within one hour they vere preparing a detailed report. on OSWALD's
activity in Russia. This, concluded the SUBJECT, is the story of

OSWALD in Russia.
C. Ps AFFILIATION

(f) The SUBJECT also indicated that he did not join the Commnist
Party until he was 27 years old, end he did this out of respect to his
father, who at the time was on his death bed and asked hin SUBJECT)
whether he would do him one more favor before he died. That is how. -:..

b the SUBJECT stated he joined the Communist Party. Otherwise, -he probably
i vould not have been a menber to this day.°

+ DIPLOMATS AND INTELLIGENCE TYPES

(g) The SUBJECT stated that the KGB are able to differentiate
between Avericans who are assigned to Moscow and are actually the.
ot State Department type, from those who have an intelligence background,

: by the fact that the intelligence type of people do not associate with
aa -... the Russian girls, that is they will not go out with them alone, whereas
! the State Department type will. “Also, over a period of a month or two,

they invariably are able to find evidence that the intelligence types
have been masturbating. This is usually detected through close exam-
. ination of the individual's towels and bed sheets.

SSTAN U-1 ATRCRAFT

(h) On 25 February 1964 during the evening meal, a discussion vas
had regarding the recent airplane crashes noted in the newspapers and on
TV in the United States. The SUBJECT commented that he has a lot of
friends who are test pilots and vho are now engaged in testing what he
referred to as a U-1 type of aircraft that ia faster than any other
aircraft in the world. He added that these friends are highly paid
but they have very dangerous jobs.

SUBJECT'S FATHER

(41) The SUBJECT also made reference to his father during this
meal, describing him as a very tall and extrenely well-built individual;
and one who was extremely intelligent and a self-made, sel. f-educated
man. He learned the shipbuilding trade mostly through his ow research
and study, and also from the SUBJECT's grandfather, who was one of the
first shipbuilders in Iussia. The SUBJECT added that his grandfather
died at the age of 94, He also stated that after the death of his
father, a memorial was built in his memory since he was considered
a@ very capable director of the government shipping industry. That
was about the last time he saw his mother and brother and sister, as
they all went to this ceremony in honor of his father. He also
indicated that there was a periodical which gave a complete run-down
on his family background, including that of his grandfather and his
father, and it was well publicized; and this he believes had a lot
to do with his being eble to get some special preference and move
along as fast as he did in the KGB organization.

KGB PRESSURE ON FAMILY

(3) On 27 February 1964 during lunch, the SUBJECT stated that he
has been informed that the KGB is putting pressure on his immediate
family, particularly his mother. However, he said he was not overly
worried about her because she is well-off financially, and being up
in age there is not mich they can do to her. However, what concerns
hin most is the fact that they have already started to pley on the
sympathies of his two children and his wife. The SURJECT stated that
he was anticipating this; however, he did not think that they would
start so soon to pressure the family. However, he dees have some hope
that in due time he may be able to get his family, out of Russia. This
hope' he said was given to him by the Chie? of SR Division.

LIBRARY OF CONGRESS PENETRATION

(k) On 25 February 1964 during a sightsceing tour of Washington
by vehicle, as we passed the Library of Congress, the SUBJECT pointed
to the building and stated that “we have people working in there",
Special Agent Stanley C. LACH sald, “who ts 'we'?" and the SUBJECT
answered, "KGB". He continued by stating that this was a good place
to place people because they could readily learn by just watching
what research was being done in the Library of Congress by the military

and thereby get an idea as to what the military was planning in the
way of armaments and things of that nature. The SUBJECT also advised
that the responsibility for getting information surreptitiously from ,
American Embassies in foreign countries who employ indigenous personnel,
falls within the confines of the KGB. He stated that the way they go
about this is to work through the indigenous personnel and arrange to
enter the enbassy at special times during the night. They would first
make a close survey and a photograph of the area in which the embassy
keeps its classified material, then they would subsequently enter this
area and open up the safes. ‘When he was asked how this was done he
stated, “oh, combinations to safes are not hard to acquire". He said
that the important and difficult part of this activity is taking the
material out and photographing it and then placing it exactly as it

was before they touched it.
