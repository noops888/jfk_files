SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and
on Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members :
of the Senate Select Coumittee (ssc) who wish to travel abroad i eee
talk to v. S. embassy and intelligence personnel. ‘It is essential i
‘that we agree on guidelines to te dase ‘serious diplomatic and security

‘roblens. The’ following cee guidelines are siieeacani :

. MEMBERS AND. STAFF OF JHE SSC_SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE

* ‘ABROAD. FOR THE PURPOSE oF. INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE

: INSTALLATIONS.

Most. of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad,

for example, are’ under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low

profile. “certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection

from exposure. At one extreme. are v. s. intelligence activities

denis the -iron curtain. These clearly need maximum Protection.
The, mere visit of ssc representatives could be notéd.as evidence
Of U.S. intelligence Presence within the country. Even in those

‘countries | where U.S. Intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and

a ‘other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government,

care is required to avoid ‘the ‘potentially grave political repercussions

lye


13-00000

that could result to U.S. and host country, activities fron exposure
= a of such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the
United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public -
exposure foe euch relationships, ° To help maintain the discreet:
: nature of the visit, ‘it would be preferable if some reason’ other
than ssc business could be given to explain any visits by SSC members
~ and staff. No ‘deliberate contact shoula be made with the. local press,

i : oe nor, should conments . :on ssc. matters be supplied if ‘investigating

officers are contacted by the press. “Local press publicity pertaining

to an ssc investigation abroad would in almost all eases, be.

e distasteful the host government.

‘In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet

‘arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence

ey activities, overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers

“within the covering embassies, Such visits are contingent upon the
ae ‘sé member not “publicly ‘declaring. himself to be on SSC business

at the time of, the, visit or upon his return, and his. proceeding

| a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

ZaE AMBASSADOR AT HE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE _ ‘THE

visrr.

oe : Al. _arrangenents. and contacts ‘will be made by him, and because of his

IIL. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
details are conveyed to the SSC. -Field intelligence elements will
only discuss operations in general terms--operational priorities,
the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,
_ velationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all
eases, such Cececded wild ‘only be conducted in ‘physical

ebideiesen a which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to
“see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between

the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered

by the host government. as extremely sensitive, politically and .
fa operationally, ‘and cannot be divulged without “the consent of the

host. government. .

Special Assistant to the DDO
SUBJECT : Covert Action Operations Against
Right Wing Governments
REFERENCE : Chief, SS/CAG Memorandum, dated

18 July 1975
Subject: "Summary of Covert Action
Operations Against Right Wing Governments"

1. EA Division is concerned about Reference and its possible
use in briefing the Senate Select Committee, Specifically, our.concern
centers on describing the EA operations contained in the attachment to

Reference as ''were mounted against" "right wing governments".
None of the EA operations -- DNSCOOP, DNSPROUT (both of which
took place in and TUMIX (which took place in --

were or should be so described as being mounted against the government
then in power. In fact, just the opposite is true. All of these
operations, while covert in the sense that the U.S. Government hand
was never disclosed, were primarily designed to broaden the base of
the governments in power and enhance its stayability by providing
advice and support to "grass root elements" in an attempt to get these
elements to function as a more cohesive organization in seeking
participation in the governmental process.

2. While all of the operations have been terminated, the
DNSCOOP operation is perhaps the most sensitive of the three, in that
it represented an initial effort by the Agency to establish contact with
opposition elements in| As noted above, the purpose of

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select
Committee and Their Staffs While
Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines
to avoid serious security problems from arising. The
following specific guidelines are considered important:

_ Members of the SSC _and members of its staff
should not publicly appear to be abroad for
purposes of investigating CIA installations.
CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under
some form of cover, have and need varying
degrees of protection from exposure. At
one extreme are Stations behind the iron
curtain or in other particularly sensitive
areas which need maximum protection. At
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy
close liaison with the host government and
are thus less sensitive. In the first case,
Stations existing under strict cover conditions
in sensitive environments, the very presence of
SSC members could be highly provocative by
flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But
even in countries in which we enjoy a good
liaison with the host country's security
service, there remains a need to be discreet.
Many countries whose services want to ‘be
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or
parliamentary exposure of the relationship.
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC
investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distastefull to a host government.

SECRET,


13-00000 _

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged

for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
uestion Station personnel on specific operational
étail. It is more fitting that Washington be the

place where operational details are conveyed to

the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide-
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms -- opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the

Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
Interview agent personnel. Foreign agent
personnel frequently are under hostile or
local service scrutiny. For them to be placed
in touch with SSC members would be to run an
unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage
could be done to agent morale and motivation
if they were to think their role had been
revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC_and their staff should not

in most cases be in contact with members o

host country's intelligence or security services.
Many services will find contact with the
politically difficult and will avoid it. They
further regard that their relationships with CIA,
the information they pass us and the sort of
cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

SECRET


No matter what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to
discuss these matters with the SSC or its
staff, and the very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause
them to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with CIA or other U.S.
intelligence agencies. Exceptions can
perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should
not visit foreign technical intelligence
installations. Again there may be exceptions
to this which can be arranged, but in most
countries in which we operate joint technical
collection sites, the host service would be

opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT : Senator Gary Hart's. Request to Talk
to QJUWIN While Traveling in Europe

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary
Hart's request to talk to a former agent while the senator
is traveling in Europe.

The agent is QJWIN. . He was first approached in 1958

through the head of the
At first_he was used mainly to spot potential agents in

various| countries. Later he became the major
asset under ZRRIFLE. In this capacity he made a brief
visit to but took no actions.

On the weekend of 7 June 1975, members of the Senate
Select Committee staff spent many hours at Headquarters
reading files, including QJWIN and ZRRIFLE, among others.
QUJWIN's true name contract is in the file which they read.
So is a street and post office address as of 1964, the
time when we ended our contract with this agent. We have
not contacted him since.

We have heard that David Aaron of the Senate Select
Committee staff telephoned QJWIN. This report remains
unconfirmed. We have protested to Bill. Miller.

; It is difficult to imagine how a U.S. senator could

talk to a former agent without interest of
the local intelligence service and
of the host government who mig) wonder abow @ propriety

of investigations being conducted on their territory and
involving one of their citizens.

In any event, an approach of this nature would be
of interest to the Department of State, and the senator
might wish to consult with the Department before proceeding.

Talking Points For Use With Senator Gary Hart On His Proposed

Contact With QJWYN

Senatorial contact with a former CIA agent would run the
risk of his exposure to his local government and the press,
Because of his former activities and relationships he
might be subjected to reprisals from abroad, possible
prosecution for espionage at home from his local govern- —
ment and harassment from the media.

Active as well as former CIA agents abroad would have
further cause to believe that the American intelligence
service is incapable of protecting its informants from dis-
closure. Contacting an agent.under the insecure conditions
involved would violate the Agency's promise to this former
informant to protect the confidentiality of the relationship.

Foreign intelligence services with which the CIA is in
liaison would find this approach highly unprofessional

and risky. It is bound to raise further questions about
the dangers of continued confidential cooperation with

the CIA.

It is possible that the local government involved might
lodge a formal protest to the-US mission protesting the
unusual procedure of a Senate investigating committee
interrogating its nationals in violation of its sovereignty
without requesting formal permission.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary
Hart's request to talk to a former agent of ours while ae
traveling in Europe. :

You should know that we have been told that the
Senate: Select Committee staff has already been in touch
with this agent by telephone. We do not know how they
learned his true name or his whereabouts. We have already
advised David Aaron of the Senate Select Committee staff
of a potential problem.area in connection with such a

a subject. of interest to.the local intelligence service

and we doubt that the host government or the intelligence
service would agree. that.a United States senator, especially
a member of the Senate Select Committee, may appropriately
conduct such investigations within its territory without
clearance to do so.

In any event, an approach of this nature would be
of interest and. indeed.of concern to the Department of
State: and tha senator. might be well advised to consult
with them before proceeding.

For your information, the agant referred to is

within THE HEAVY
BRACKETS,

SUBJECT: GUIDELINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND

THEIR STAFFS WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD

There have been already and there will continue to be members

of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and

talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential

that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security

problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE

ABROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE

INSTALLATIONS.

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad,
for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining
a low profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of
protection from ae At one extreme are U.S. intelligence
activities behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximun
protection. Ther mere visit of ‘ssc. representatives could be
noted as evidence of U.S. intelligence presence within the
country. Even in those countries where U.S. intelligence
efforts enjoy the shielding and other benefits flowing from
close liaison with the host government, care is required to

avoid the potentially grave political repercussions that

2s Tune Jotest Vevsron, shear pavatiy

proposed clorges by DoD.


13-00000

could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison. {Several foreign governments or ‘entities thereof
now willing to cooperate privately with the U.S. in intelligence
agreements~exchanges maintain strong/neutral or anti-U.S, foreign
policies; continuation of such agreements-exchanges is therefore
dependent upon avoidance of their public disclosure. -In many
cases termination of such agreements would result in the loss

of unique strategic intelligence, and alternate collection

methods are either not available or are prohibitively expensive

To help maintain the discreet nature of the visit, it would be
preferable if some reason other than SSC business could be
given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff. No
deliberate contact should be made with the local press, nor :
should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating

officers are contacted by the press. Local press publicity

. pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all .

cases be distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas,
discreet arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S.
intelligence activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with
senior officers within the covering embassies. Such visits are
contingent upon the SSC member not publicly declaring himself
to be on SSC business at the time of the visit or upon’ his

return, and his proceeding on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.


13-00000

ir,

THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE

OF THE VISIT.
All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because

of his knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.

FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE

CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational

details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements

“will only discuss operations in general terms-~operational

priorities, the kinds of operations conducted, the operational

-environment, relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches,

etc. In all cases, such discussions will only be conducted in

physical surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.
Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to

see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between

the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered

by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and

operationally, and cannot be divulged without ‘the coasent of

the host government. :

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local

service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members


would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious
damage would be done to agent morale and motivation if their

identity were to be revealed to Members or staff of the SSC,

MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY-INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the

SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard
that their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the
information they pass, and the cooperation extended are all most
sensitive matters. Regardless what assurances are given then,
they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters
with members or staff of the SSC. The oe fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause the host service to
reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. intelligence

activities.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN TECHNICAL

INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection
sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S.
Congressional representatives, especially where there is public

knowledge of the Congressional investigating interests. If such


a visit is considered essential, a special request must ‘be

negotiated with the’ host country in advance.

Senate Select Committee principals and staff should --
understand the distinction between U.S. intelligence
installations abroad and joint U.S.-foreign intelligence
installations or foreign intelligence installations supported
by the U.S. intelligence community. Access to the former

is at the discretion of ‘the U.S. Ambassador; access to the

latter two is at the discretion of the foreign government

involved J

AN- ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND STAFF,

PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representa-
‘tives of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.),
as appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize
the visitor with the types of activities conducted at each
location, the restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities
in each case and the considerations which preclude the discussion

of operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment.

- Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that

they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition

intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff

members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly

travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION

DATE AND. PLACE: 17 June 1975 1000 - 1100
Room 2E-45

SUBJECT: Conversation by Mr. John Waller, SA/DDO with
Mr. David Aaron, member of Senator Mondale's
staff, with Regard to the Senator's Proposed
Trip to Europe

1. According to Mr. Aaron the Senator and Mr. Aaron's itinerary,
while not yet fixed, will be along the following lines:

a. 30 June - 1 July:

b. Monday, 7 June: |, for one day
Cc. | hough the order ‘has not yet been
letermined, the| stop would be two days and the
top, one day.

In the period be weer the party intends to visit
Oslo and Helsinki. ie purpose o TS part of the trip, however,

has nothing to do with the SSC and the party does not want or need

2. Mr. Aaron agrees that in discussions with Stations, the
party should not get into specific operational cases. They want to
discuss “more generic" subjects: operational priorities, relations
with the Embassy, problems, scope of liaison, operating conditions,
etc. Their basic interests are related to “command and control".

It had occurred to Aaron that would be a good example of a \
Station which concentrates on "East - West" operations (read third
country, Sov and Sov Bloc operations). He recognized was a

liaison station. Mondale, however, was anxious to talk to

E2 IMPDET

_ | SECRET

he felt. would provide some understanding of "third world”
operations. he felt, would be a good example of the inter-
relations of a CIA Station with the Military and the Foreign Service.

3. Mr. Aaron stated that he had already sought out

of the requesting that contacts be arranged in
‘jate Foreign Office or Intelligence Offices
in order to discuss the| experi. in" ne

Aaron is also interested 1m how the

works. He had heard that it was proving inadequate. Mr. Aaron
stated that! lhad not been enthusiastic about the idea but
promised to look into it. Aaron felt that it had been better to
work directly with [__] whom he claimed to know,than to involve
the Agency's go-between.

4. Mr. Aaron intended to make a similar approach to the
Embassy.

5. Mr. Waller commented that such approaches to foreign
governments would make our liaison services uneasy and could
adversely affect their willingness to cooperate. To this reason,
we did not favor involving foreign governments -- at whatever
level or wherever in the bureaucracy. Moreover, contacts with
foreign governments increased the likelihood that the true purpose
of the Senator's trip could leak to the press. Mr. Waller mentioned
that he would want to bring this to the attention of others.

6. Mr. Aaron agreed that the Senator, through press conferences
or otherwise, would not make public the fact that his trip was
connected with Select Committee investigations.

7. Mr. Aaron said that he and the Senator were in touch with
Mr. Hyland of the State Department with regard to this trip. He
also suggested that they might get in touch with military intelligence
services in Washington and in the field. He made specific reference
to "Naval Intelligence”.

8. Mr. Aaron stressed the fact that the itinerary was still
tentative and subject to change.

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select
Committee and Their Staffs While
Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines
to avoid serious security problems from arising. The
following specific guidelines are considered important:

ete Members of the SSC _and members of its staff
Should not publicly appear to be abroad for
urposes of investigatin installations.
CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under
some form of cover, have and need varying
degrees of protection from exposure. At
one extreme are Stations behind the iron
curtain or in other particularly sensitive
areas which need maximum protection. At
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy
close liaison with the host government and
are thus less sensitive. In the first case,
Stations existing under strict cover conditions
in sensitive environments, the very presence of
SSC members could be highly provocative by
flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But
even in countries in which we enjoy a good
liaison with the host country's security
service, there remains a need to be discreet.
Many countries whose services want to be
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or
parliamentary exposure of the relationship.
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC
investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distastefull to a host government.

SECRET


SECRET O

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged

for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
question Station personnel on specific operational
etail. It is more fitting that Washington be the
place where operational details are conveyed to
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide-
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms -- opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the
Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
interview agent personnel. Foreign agent
personnel frequently are under hostile or
local service scrutiny. For them to be placed
in touch with SSC members would be to run an
unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage
could be done to agent morale and motivation
if they were to think their role had been
revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not

in most cases be in contact with members o

host country’s intelligence or security services.
Many services will find contact with the SST
politically difficult and will avoid it. They
further regard that their relationships with CIA,
the information they pass us and the sort of
cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

SECRET


SEUHEA

No matter what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to
discuss these matters with the SSC or its
staff, and the very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause
them to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with CIA or other U.S.
intelligence agencies. Exceptions can
perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should
not visit foreign technical intelligence
installations. Again there may be exceptions
to this which can be arranged, but in most
countries in which we operate joint technical
collection sites, the host service would be

opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

SUBJECT:. Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and
Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad :

There have been already and there will continue to be members

of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and.

talk to U.S. embassy: and intelligence personnel... It is essential that

we agree on guidelines. to. avoid serious: diplomatic and security. prablems..

“The following. specific guidelines are applicable:

I, MEMBERS AND'STAFF. OF THE. SSC SHOULD PUBLICLY APPEAR

TO BE ABROAD FOR SOME:PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE

INVESTIGATION OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS,

Most of these. eieaeae including all CIA stations abroad, for
oe example} are eader canis tore of cover, or are maintaining a low
profile. : Certainly all have and need varying degrees of. protection
from exposure. ‘At. one extreme are U,S. intelligence activities
behind the irom curtain. These clearly need maximum protection.
The mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence
, of U.S. intelligence presence within the country. Even in those é
countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and

other benefits flowing from closé liaison with the host government,

care.is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions


13-00000

ar

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure

of such liaison, Many countries that wish to cooperate with the

United States.in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public
exposure of such relationships.. Some reason other than SSC business
should. be given to explain any visits by SSC members aad to

help maintain the discreet nature of the visit. -No deliberate contact
should.be:made with the local press, ‘nor should comments on SSC
matters be. supplied if investigating. officers are: contacted by the
press. Local press. publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abrozd
would in almost all cases be distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet
arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence
activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers
within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the
SSG niember not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business
at the time of the visit or upen his return, and his proceeding on a

basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE VISIT.

All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because of his

. knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.


qi.

FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL

SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS,

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will
only discuss operations in general terms -- operational priorities;
the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,
relationships: with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all
cases, such discussions.will only. be conducted.in physical surroundings
which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to
see texts of, or general notes on intelligence agreements between the
U.S.. and the -host government. These are usually considered by the
host governrnent ‘as extremely sensitive, politically and operationally,

‘
and cannot be: divulged without the consent of the host government.

MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT
PERSONNEL,
Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service

scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be


13-00000

to run an. unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be
done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to. be

revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.

V. MEMBERS: OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY
“SERVICES WILL BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES:
Many foreign intelligence services. will find contact with the SSC.
politically difficult and will avoid it.. They further regard that their
relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the ie etitios they
pass, and the ecoperaHon extended are all most sensitive matters.
Regardless. what assurances are given them, they would find it

difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with members or

investigation

staff of the SSC: The very fact that such matters were und
could well cause: the host’service to reassess the desirability of a

relationship with U.S. intelligence activities.

EMBERS AND'STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN

TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS,

* In those countries in which we operate joint: technical collection sites,
the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S. Congressional
representatives, especially where there is public knowledge of the

Congressional investigating interests. If such a visit is considered


13-00000

essential,.a special request must be negotiated with the host’country

in advance.

- VIL. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS

AND STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE,

This briefing will -be*conducted by the DCL and other representatives
of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.),; as--
appropriate. . ‘The purpose of this. briefing is to familiarize the
visitor with the.types of activities.conducted-at each location, the

restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case and

the considerations which preclude the discussion of operational details,

names and terms in an overseas, environment.

Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that
they and their activities are matters of-great interest to oppositi mn
intelligence services, as well as.to the-press. Committee and staff.
