Lan surry to say that, beeause of « deadline I had to meet, the memo

i 34

for the resord was not written until Several days after ay meeting with
Gubjoat, It may be inearrest on some details of W's history, whieh you
would of course know all about, if the story in the first paragraph does
pet perfeetly mateh what W. has told you, the feult is protably mine, not
Pe you might eall we if you see ary YEXKWOT inconsistencies.

on Soviet attitudes
t. Generally speaking, the information ¥. gave Adoes ot seen to ne tne
fonstotent with what I heve seen from other sourees, On the questions
‘ sosial Fratton end Feligion, sie reply was more *pro~Soviet* thea
information bev froajother sourece. On the other hand, his anevers on
lat seieias and hie etateménte on drunkenness certainly did not east
ov very favorable 1IX light ‘on Soviet soeiety. One interesting answer

which I neglected to ineiude in ay meno indieated the ontiming extetence

of pro-Stalin sentinent,

i, In the firat paragraph of the memo, I state that W. seened ‘poli tienda

OF Adeologieally unsophisticated." It probebly would have been nore correct

te oy that he wes uninterested, or unoonnitted, rather than EXEEEX unsophiati~
‘cated, though that was aleo tris, Such negative references ss he nade to.

Soviet ideas (and there wers not nary such references) seened a little in-!

tended to satisfy me; they were miinly made in the first part of the inter!
vlew, before any rapport vas established, If he wae unhappy in Leningrad, '

At seened to bs becaute he felt hinself an alien, and because he vas hooe~-

etek for the good old USA, not beccure there was anything wrong with Com

munien, or anything good about American polities) institutions, He pre~

rented hirself sorewtist as the ordinary uy who tries to get alongs a Lite,



Me ¥e provinesal or even puritanteal in making moral Judgnents on cthers,

‘even while obviously exposed to moral eritieisn himself, He deseribed the

pes. of hie sother's condition as having MIM been # Teal shock to hin,

ood this scens eonsistent uit hie tendency to eritieies drunkenness, bad

Language, elipshod work, and so forth in others, He sonnented, rather

bprrerinely, that Soviet children really mind when they are seclded by

te strangers, whereat Anertean children (he thought) would not, I

would expect that he would be a good reactor when eubaitted to a poly=
‘sph. Perhaps because EX he had already been questioned for several

dents te teed 2s punt rat py especially when eny

pee wy qastions seoned to stray fron the subject of Soviet publis sttitader.

pe the other hand, he volunteered X quite « few renarka about his own

fae, bis own problems, He appeared to be worried about his ehanees of

Finding & Job, and mentioned that one old friend (who had atuek by hin

fan the way") was trying to help hin in this,

4 When the tine eane for mo to depart, i.e, when I had asked 22) the
eations I could think of, he eked {f sarthing further wae to happen

that day. I said that all I knew (MS “hat you hed told us when you left,
that there was nothing further set up, and thet Z could simply leave when
fantane, He offered mo a drink, whieh I declined, saying I wanted to got
eve. T think he rether enjoyed the interview, or at least ME the chance
& Spout off hix views, As my memo indteates, I wan impressed by his

pave fculatenesm, which probably resulted from his saying things he had
fhought out and prepared hinself to say, I did not realy srces-question
hia, in the sense of trying to cateh hin aut, or probing his om notivess
he was willing to run on and I wes willing to let him, asking new questions

when he hed waid 211 he couid on old ones.
