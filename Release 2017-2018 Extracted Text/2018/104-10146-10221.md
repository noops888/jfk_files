30. (Secret - PLC) LIAISON Elliott Brown, staff of the House Select

Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, called to alert me to the article

by Jack Anderson on illicit drug trafficking in Ecuador in today's

Washington Post. He said the article may focus broad congressional attention to

the problem. Brown will get back to me to arrange the meeting with Chairman

Lester Wolff (D., N. Y.) to discuss the Agency's field report on the subject

which Chairmas Wolff had requested earlier.

31. (Secret - PLC) LIAISON Bill Ashbaugh, OGC, called seeking

guidance to respond to a call received from an investigator with the Office of

Security operating under DOD credentials. The individual entered on duty

with the Agency in October 1974 and had been a police officer with the Memphis

City Police Department, during which time he was an eye-witness to the Dr.

Martin Luther King assassination. A staff member of the House Select

Committee on Assassinations had contacted the individual through DOD and

was to interview him in the Committee offices within the hour. I told Ashbaugh

that Gary Cornwell, Deputy Staff Chief of the Committee, was in my office

and I would discuss the matter with Cornwell and call him back. I explained

to Cornwell that the individual is actually an Agency employee and came on

board in 1974. Cornwell agreed that the interviewer need not be aware of the

Agency connection and I explained that we would instruct the individual to

respond fully to the questions asked by the staffer, but to stay strictly within

his Defense cover. Cornwell fully agreed and said no notation will be made in

the Committee files on his present CIA connection. Ashbaugh was notified and I

requested that he instruct the individual to maintain his cover during the

interview.

32. (Unclassified - PLC) LIAISON Peter Regis, House Judiciary

Committee staff, called and asked that a meeting be arranged sometime next

week for him to go over the notes he made from his review of CLA documents

on alleged Nazi war criminals residing in the U.S. which we have been holding

due to their classification. He will call me to set up a definite time.

33. (Unclassified - GMC) LIAISON Took a call from Beverly Lumpkin,

staff of the House International Relations Subcommittee on International

Organizations, regarding the sending of a courier to pick up a narrative

summary of material which the Subcommittee would like to have reviewed for

public release under procedures established in the Memorandum of Understanding.

A courier was arranged and picked up the summary.
