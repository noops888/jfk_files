AMLASH: MEBTING WITH FITZGERALD BOP so hog

AMLASH-1 insisted on meeting with a senior United
States official for assurances of American support.

FITZGERALD and HELMS agreed that FITZGERALD should
meet AMLASH in Paris and hold himself out as a per-
sonal representative of RFK. HELMS decided that it
was unnecessary to seek approval from RFK because he
believed the operation was consistent with RFK's
general policies toward Cuba.

FITZGERALD met CUBELA on October 29, and promised

to aid any anti-communist groups which could
neutralize Castro. CUBELA requested a high-powered
rifle with telescopic sights. FITZGERALD told CUBELA
that the United States would not take part in an assas
sination scheme.

November 19, 1963

he would be given a cache inside Cuba. Cache could,
if he requested it, include . . . high powered rifles
with scopes... .”
