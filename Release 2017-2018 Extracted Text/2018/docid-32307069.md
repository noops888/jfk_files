" Maraboto said members planned to rendezvous at an

undisclosed location on the countryside between Ponce and

Juana Diaz.

"'*It resembles "'rural Cuba," he said.

" Names of the underground will remain anonymous."

According to the July 24, 1962, issue of the San

Juan star, which carried an article concerning the June, it

said in an interview that all

political factions

outside Cuba would be accommodated in a new Junta Revolucionaria

(JURE) in an effort to restore the splintered movement into

an effective working organization.

Ray added that the Movement would be financed almost

entirely by Cubans. He stated,

advised on May &, 1962, that Manolo Ray had practically no

following in fuerto Rico or the United States and that the

cuban exiles considered him to be, politically speaking, left
