Juan Star, which carried an article concerning. the JURE, it
was indicated that Manolo Ray, former president of the Exile
Popular Revolutionary Movement, (PRM), a Cuban Exile Movement,
said in an interview that all "Popular" political factions
outside Cuba would be accommodated in a new Junta Revolucionaria
(JURE) in an effort to restore the splintered movement into
an effective working organization.

Ray added that the Movement would be financed almost
entirely by Cubans. He stated, "we can win with our own

don't believe that Cubans can win without United States aid
should not join us." Ge yu)

he once held among the Cuban exiles. None of the Cuban exile
leaders are expected to attend this meeting as they have no
confidence in Manolo Ray or his ideas concerning Cuba.

to attend this meeting but the 113 Cubans mentioned in the
article as the number expected to attend, was strictly a
