the interested area divisions.)

2. The policy outlined in the attached memorandum has been approved

by the Deputy Director for Plans, who has directed the following actions:

ao Undertake, in collaboration with each area division, a

country by country analysis of all indigenous broadcasting and

television systems for the purpose of devising plans for their

penetration, where feasible, or an explanation where it appears

not to be feasible.

Do Develoy and subnit; in collaboration with the appropriate

personnel and training offices, a plan for the recruitment and

training of officers qualified for covert broadcasting oporations.

Co. Explore with the State Department the possibilities of a

Joint undertaking to exploit full?, in the interest of efficiency

and economy, material derived from escapee interrogations and other

intelligence sources, covert as well as overt, to support all los.

propaganda efforts.

do Develop and reconmend, in collaboration with area divinicas,

an improved method for the issuance and dissemination of policy

guidance to. the field.

Prepare and submit, in collaboration with General McCelland,

a project to produce broadcasting devices capable of electronic

intrusion into Conmunist broadcasts; to develop special techniques

for their use; and to continue research and development of other

unconventional methods of broadcasting suitable to our mission.

It is estimated that these neasures

reduce the effectiveness of free world broadcasts to the Orbit by as much,

If not more than, 50 percent.

An inlustration is that the Communists

ho The one-sided contest is even more marked in a comparison

of the broadeast.output of the ussh alone, without the satellites,

against Furope.

It subjects Spain, Greece and Italy together, for

instanco, to 140 hours of broadcasts per week. The combined broadcasts

of these three countries to the USSR, however, number only 19 hours per

week.

France and Turkey who, together, receive 64 hours per week from

the USSi, make no broadcasts at all to the USSR.

I. Appendix I gives a compilation by country or area of the

international broadcasts to and from USSR and the satellites. It shows

that the communists are outslugging the free world, and that western

Europe, in particular, is doing far legs than it should in the radio

propagande battle with the Orbit.

2o Capabilities

Several techniques are available to CIA for the use of radio

broadcasting in its covert psychological warfare mission.

cover of covertly controlled emigre groups.

This technique rormally

"captive" resistance movements using relatively low power and employing

a frequency switching technique to evade jamming. This technique presents

more manageable security and control problems, delivers a signal in spite

listeners and presents special problems in avoiding interference with

broadcasts of friendly countries.

A glance at the world nap is sufficient to indicate the

Imnensity of this field of potentialities, both as concerns the

countries on the peripheries of the USSR and Conmunist China in

Europe, the Near Fast and Far Last; and in Latin America as well.

We propose that an immediate start be made, in cooperation with Area

having access to shortave receivers is estimated to be constantly

decreasing que to Soviet efforts to increase grop listening by means

of wired networks

Nevertheless, it would appear that there will be a

sizeable potential audience for foreiin broadcasts in all three

bands, for some time to come. One indication of this is the

fact that at present the USSR is broadcasting approximately 900 houre

to 8 10

per day over 160 transmitters in 26 or more languages to its oun people,.

Many of these transmissions are to areas and over frequencies which lie

Basos

(1) Because governents object to providing bases for

Orbit, Furthernoro, adequate broadcasting facilities take time to

plan, build, and staff and long tenure is therefore

ever, the polltical climate of a country can change abruptly, with

resulting uncertainty as to length of tenure. Munich, for instance,

which once furnished an excellent base for & variety of broadcasts

targeted to the Orbit, appears to be becoming less and less satislactory®

Cover and control problems are closely related to

this. A base for & secure and competently managod operation should be

less diffieult to obtain than for a loosely organized one.

(2) Seaborne transmitters offer much in mobility but,

anterna limitations restrict their effective pover.. As in the case

•1 the VOA COURITR, stationary antennas on land are required for

marinan effectiveness. Thus, the political problen becomes the same

as for land trananitter bases, and costs in investment and maintenance

are considerably higher

than land based operations.

Moreover, the

diffleulties of providing credible cover for a covert seaborne operation

are manifest. While this office will contime to study VOA experience

In this feld, 1t sees no prospect of any agency use for it.

(3) The VIA prosently controls numerous broadcasting

bases and are developing additional bases, in areas of the world

suitable for our purposes.

countrios have already been negotiated; power, housing,

tion and other logistics have been provided.

In addition to the saving in costs this would furnish us

upon intelligence reports, interrogation of refectors, escapees

and exiles, indigenous newspapers and a regular flos of intercepts

from enemy broadcasts.

far from adequate, rarely timely, and unnecessarily costly. FBIDe VOLD

and severad others monitor the same foreign broadcasts to extract the

sane or similar information.

Several U.S. agencies interrogate the

same exiles for PW information, whereas a

single interrogator, trained

in fw needs, could supply most, if not all, the requirements not only

for all radio but all other Ph activities better and faster. A cleared

consultant, on behalf of one of our more successful operations, pro

duced on abundance of excellent support information and evaluation

The same data, properly sterilized and speedily disseminated,

could equally serve the VOA and any other covert or overt Fl effort

targeted to the same area.

This complex problem needs a high level decision

by State and CIA and the appointent of a small tean of officers

experienced in hoth TW and interrogation work with power to devise

an effective and efficient program to exploit our rich resources.

do Jo Deliver a Signal, That Can Bo Hoard

(1) Soviet jamming of propaganda broadcasts raises

serious questions concerning our ability to deliver a signal that

can be heard above the jamming.

To be sure, some of our broadcasts

get through because they are unable simultaneously to jam broadcasts

in all areas nor do they in practice jam a given broadeast trang

mission at all hours.

For future plaming purposes, however, these factors

seen clear:

(a) Soviet capabilities for jarming are large and

on the increase.

(b) The degree of their janming seens to be re-

lated to their estimate of the harmful effect of the broadcasts on

their interests.

Hence, the more effective parts of our propaganda

are likely to be jammed even though other parts get through.

(e) We have no present capabilities to monitor

theis jorning if they uses they probably do in congested areas.

1ou-powered local Jammers.

(2) Prudent planning would, therefore, require that

any subatantial future investments by CIA in radio broadcasting

transmitters include provision for all possible techniques to ensure

our broadcasts being heard to the maximum in spite of janning.

ment?

(a) To deliver a signal of such power as to be

heard above the jarming.

Here we are at a disadvantage in that

Lopowered and inexpensive local jammer is capable of rendering

unintelligible & signal of substantially higher power from a distant

point.

The greater the pover of our transmitter the more complicated

the installation and the more expensive the investment. And the more

diffleult becomes the cover and security problems as well as the

political considerations involved in base negotiations. Since the

eneny is not required to equal. our poser with his jammers, we would

thorelore be fighting a losing battle if ve attempted to "slug it out*

or a power basis only.

(b) Jarming evasion through the device of vary

ing the frequency has so far proven to be an effective means of lay..

ing down a signal that can be heard clearly despite jarming. This

method requires constant dial changing by the listener and must

assume therefore a desire on his part to hear the program sufficient

to overcome the annoyance of dial twisting. When used in combination

with appropriate programming techniques and the use of two or more

frequencies simultaneously this has so far proven to be the most

effective means of jamming avoidance.

Such frequency shiftings cannot be accomplished

writhin the legal rules laid down for international broadcasting.

These must thereforo, be "black" broadeasts in the sense that they

can be credibly denied by our Government as well as the goverrment

of the host country. The movement at will through various frequencies

prodices en annoying interference for the listeners to broadcasters to

whom those frequencies are legally assigned. This interference, while

fully justified in the case of USSR and satellite assigned frequencies,

must be avoided in

the case of frequencies assigned to our friends.

Our broadcasts using this technique have so

far aroided annoyance to friendly countries by the use of very low

barget and that only on the periphery.

This limits us to a small part of the total Soviet Orbit

The same techniques can be

used with higher power and at greater distances from the target.

To avold interference with friendly nations! broadeasts the base

must be located in an area which, with the proper antenna adjust

ments, permits our signal to "skip" over the territory of friendly

countries in its pauh. An example would be that, given a transmitting

bass in Saudi Arabia for broadcasts to the USSR, the facility would

have to be engineared so that its signal would not interfere with

local broadcast recaption in Turkey and other friendly countries in

techniques for the penetration of enemy domestic radio broadcasting

seryices night well enable us to overcome the handicaps imposed by

the jaming of our conventional broadcasts to the Soviet orbit and

seize the cold war initiative in the radio sphere. It is a field

which has been neglected thus far

Some possibilities in this area are described

in the "Project Troy" report of the Massachusetts Institute of

Technology (Vol, IV, Annex 26) of 1 February, 1951.

Among them is the "intrusion," or "side-band

injection," technique which was used successfully by the Russians

against Germany during World War II. It would enable us to intrude

our own propaganda messages into radio programs being broadcast on

enemy home channels.

It would enable us in effect to talk to the

Soviet, satellite and neutral radio audiences over enemy facilities

of compel the eneny to disrupt his own broadcast service in an effort

to prevent it.

It could also be used in turning Soviet propaganda

broadeasts to Western Europe to the advantage of our friends. The Troy

report observes as to the technique itself:

This would be an effective and annoying

technique which would be extremely difficult to counter."

Utilization of this technique appears to be

within our capabilities at the moment. It has been field tested

and is ready for use an soon as the necessary technical adaptationg

can be made to conventional tranmitters.

The time and cost involved

in mounting a facility for utilizing this technique is now being

explored by ADCO at the suggestion of this office.

Another unconventional technique being devel

oped by an agency consultant and now almost ready for field testing

This operates on the theory that

Other unconventional means of carrying the

cold war to the Orbit by neans of clandestine radio might be cap

potentialities in this field should be explored to the utmost.

This office is convinced that emphasis must

be placed more and more on unconventional radio broadeasting tech-

niques if the cold war of the alr

waves is not to become more one-

sided than it already is

in favor of the Communists. Properly devel-

oped and utilized, those techniques already perfected or in the pro

cess of perfection and those which might be invented might even be

favor. They would be indispensable in the event of hot war.

We,

therefore, are impressed with the necessity of developing our capaci

ties in this direction to the utmost and proceeding immediately with

the covert procurement of bases and eguipment noeded for the task.

To rocapitulate, it would seem desirable for

CIA to limit its present and future conventional radio broadeasting

scitvities to the absolute minimm and that any now undertekings

should provide:

Load Time

(J) (a) Radio broadeasting facilities cannot be created

over night.

Fron the time that plans are finally approved, it takas

12 to 18 months to design, construct and instell a transitter.

Prior to such approval time is required for the planning cycle, negotie

upwards of two years are reguired from the conception of a project

for broadcasting and its implementation. Hence, the plaming must

Itles for targets of opportunity, such as Stalin's death.

L. Comtrol and Management

(1) Control by CIA of the substance of Iroadeast and

the management of broadeasting operations should be absolute and through

officers directly responsible to agency control.

(2) The doctrine of compartmentalization should be

strictly enforced. No one, excepting the handful of technicians required

(25 February: 1953-IS 86889) -attantion was called to the need for a

continuing evaluation of ill radio broadeasting operations with partic

alar reference to coverage and impact, and sources for the essential

information were outlined.

(2) PP/OPS, in collaboration with this office, has

Initiated this much-needed undertaking.

ho Personnel

(1) There is a shortage of professional and technical

personnel qualified for covert radio broadcasting. A program of

selective recruitment should be undertaken in coordination with any

plane for new radio projects.

(2) A training program in covert broadeasting techniques

should also be initiated: This training should be undertaken in safe

houses by detail of qualified instructors from covert training for basie

indoetrination; to be supplemented by area instruction by the area desks

and specialized radio training by Coimo. and this office.

Recommendations

Pending clarification of CIA's future responsibility in the

cold war we have made certain assumptions as to the criteria which

should govern agency activities in radio broadeasting.

Our thesis is that CIA should use radio broadcasting in

covert Psychological Warfare only under the following conditions;

That the tack cannot be performed by YOA or other

overt media.

That any contemplated operation follow striet co.

cepts for clandestine operations, including

(1) Positive and direct agency control of both

management and poliey.

(2) Strict security requirements ineluding com

partmentation of all elements of broadeasting operations.
