In thie addendum to the OVERSEAS FAMILY article, I sve sat sought to refute er
confira each and every assertion made ty ite author, Thomas C. Lucey. Ur. Lucey, despite
Nis citing @ substantial rumber of ineccuracies, hns fonetheizss 3 f.

sted a vest area cf
what may be termed the fundamental truth. #ith this in sind, <= Save pried to set the
record: straight only, insofar ae it rert

ne to those inacceracies = and omissions
* which in my opinion reflect adversely onthe whole.

view lrs Lucey'e. account in a somowhat differeat perepective, I. shall
begin ‘by advising that I. firet went to’work for the Central. izteiligence agency much
earlier than Aupiist-1962, It was during the winter of 1955-5, wile ‘assigned a Case
Review Officer with the Counter Intelligence Corps at Los Angeles, » that I wae initially
recruited into the CIA's forflung notwork of informants and agents, one ofa number, I
suppose, within the Defense Dopartment's intelligence conmunizs eho helped ‘the Agency
Keep an eye on ite not always ‘tame coapetitors . My recruitment ‘ss handled. bya Herbert
Leibacher, an agent of the ClA‘e Loc Angclee office, and a Joe Davscon, later identified
tome:-through .‘photegrapha...ae,.en- officiel. from.CIA headquirters, then located on "E*
in Washington, DsC.. -Motiveted ‘by a dupree of naivete ent the agency's subtle
minders’ that I owed a greater duty to: ay country than to the militery establishment, Z
served. a8 a “non=paidy. confidential informent..off-and on until xy resignation: from the
Arny in Octobér 1959. “A complete description of the information I suzplied te the Agency
during wy ailitary cereer would-only add'to-what must perforce become a lengthy addendu
may it suffice to say that it did not alweys-scem germane to intelligence affairs, but
when it did it-consisted mainly of an-assortaent of data that for so-called discretionary
réacons: was seldom passed on to the. “Agency, (or for that matter, to our own higher

echelons) through reguler channelo,”

“In order to

Mr. Lucey's: statement, “Being merriod “to “a foreign natizzal meant an automatic
removal from intelligence -work 80 Nagell.decided to leave the army,” is misleading end
incorrect in ite entirety. The only military intelligence orgsaization from which en
individual is normully removed subcequent to marrying a foreign sational’ ie the CIC ~
primarily a security type orgen’= and this’ rule doos not necesserily apply when the agent
ip an ‘enlisted ‘man. or wdrrant officers” As a commigsioned officer, I wns declered
ineligible for’ further. duty with the.CIC effective 14 Arril 1959, a full year after. xy
morriage toa foreign. nationsl. I was not barred from assignment to other, even more
sensitive, UI organizations such as Field Operations Intelligence, then the. clandestine
eopionage depsrtuent of militdry intelligence, As for the reasons I left the Aray, they
were clearly if euphemisticelly expluined- in ay second letter cf.resignation, dated
92 August’19S9, nemely: "I desire to tender. ay resignation because I wish to further ay
civilian education. It is not possible for me to purcue the curriculue of which I am
desirous while. on active duty. Also, comptssioncte reasons of s rerronal nature exist

+ for desiring to tender my resignetion at this time."

My patronage under the CIA did not end with my dischur,e from the Army and ensuing
employzent in Decomber 1959 as en investigator for the State of Celifornia; in fact,
henceforth I was offered remuneration for my servicce, however nozizal it rometimes was.
What ny now taske compriced is of no ‘real pertinence to this sddendun or to later
developments, except perhaps to sention that one of my contects.said he corked out of
“Domestic Intellirence,” possibly the forerunner of the’ present-ast sozestic Operations
Division, which ‘illegnily keeps taba on'a wide :ronge-of American ian organizations
and activities. I should oleo point out that I did not quit my position with the. State
of California “to work for the CIA," es idplied by Mr. Lucey. I wus tismissed, in.June
1962, at ay own option and in my opinion for doing>my job. (The S:ltowing conth I wes

relative to "dissident"

\Catiforni

Texan on 20 Soptesher 19€3, I wad employed ty the Arency inn capecity which can be
oceurately described ms that of on rfent, in every sense of tie word. My essignaents
varied end necessitated travel to, three Latin American nations and anny otntes, - including
the Comnonwenlth of Fuerto Rico.’ They alro necessitated my taking on cover employment
for one week im New York and for about ten wcekS in Los Angeles, thourh usually I posed
as. tourist, an investigator for the. Immigration & Naturalization Service or sa a
researcher™ for a private firm, the appropriate crelentials being furnished to mo by the
CIA To.-sum-it up briefly,. I operated in Mexico City at the onset of the Cubsn Missile
Crivie in’.an effort ‘aimed chiefly. at the-.Soyiet government; I conducted inquiries
menbers of. several. Cuban refugee groups based in the United
Statec;. I. checked: -out...an. ellered connection between’ a Miuci-rerident named. Eladio Del
Valle. and NewOrleans CIA informant-Sergio. Arcacha=Smith; { investigated an associate of
the now. daceased right-wing extremist David W. Ferrie of New Orloans, as I did the
activities of <left=-wingers Vaughn -L. Snipes” and his wife,, Priscille, near. Venic

-and-others;. I conducted ‘a surveiltanceon a-man, said to have deem an ex-CIA
‘onpioyee,observed talkingito URP  Yeader Manuel.artime and former Cuban senator/rackoteer
Rolando Masferrers I. inquired into 'on allegation that Murina Oswald iatended to divorce
her husband and return to the U.S.S.R. (although I never stated that I met her personally,
Ao. was roported by the. FBI and. Secret: Service); end -I performed courier duties and acted
Qo. a cut-out. “At the time of my arrest Iwas operating-in an undevcover role, ving
bacone involved ine domectic~incpired plot to, assassinate Precident Kennedy and,

lesotwiae ostencidly, other highly-placed government officials.

Mr, Lucey goes cn to state that my last assirnment at the tize as to penetrate the
Foir Play for Cuba:Comaittee, where he dot Oswald.” Such otatement is also incorrect. I
was never @ member, bond-fide or otherwise, of the FFCC. And my conversations with FPCC
functionaries like Steve Roberts, an official of the Socialist Workera Porty at Loa
Angeles, could hardly be construed as a penetration. Furthernore, I had been introduced
to Mr. Oswald long before the FFCC came into existence, albeit under an ansumed name.

As to. the .allurion that. I told “Bob” I was an intelligence man, not a killer,
therefore I coulda't’xill Mrs ‘Oewald, while the reference is true ite connotation is
deceptive. I had killed before and I had*participated in homicides under the auspicea of
both UI and the CIA (one instance being the part I played in the February 1958 abduction-
interrogation-murder of an FOI agent, a U.S. soldier, USCT Emmett E. Dugan, from Crafton,
Pa., suspected of having defected” in place to the Chinese), under the guise that an
American variation of the Soviet “wet affair" was the only alternative, that it was
either essential to dome overall intelligence effort or in the best interests of our
national security. ‘and -it was a. similar-sounding argument, ultiaately reduced to a
threat, that was advanced to me by Robert Craham as an incentive to dispose of Mr. Oswald
in Septender 1963. But my refueal to do so had absolutely no bearing on the reason for
effecting my arrest inthe manner-I chose, nor did it engender in me fear of roprieal by

the CIA.

Pertaining to sy arrest ‘and convictions at El Paso, Texas, which the official
spokesmen and tha press:have 80 neatly lebeled 06 being for “bank robbery,” let one of
the government's own spurious records, the eppelate court decision that finally yawned a
judgement of acquittal in ay case, give ite version: “The charge was then, and is now,
entoring a federally insured bank with intent-to rob." What the record aptly ignorea ie
the fact that two: juri: incensed by the prosecution's innuendoes in and out of the
courtroom (and by the ranificationa of perjured testimony and a false Bureau of Prisone
report mate availeble te the jury during ite deliberations at the second trial = though
never forsally admitted into evidence) that I-was a Communist, no doubt a very red spy,
twice convicted me of having “intended" to take by force and violence one hundred dollar:
worth of Travelers Cheques from a bank’ teller.

I shall not herein attempt to .list oven generally the injustices to which I
subjected by. a corrupt judicinl syotem, nor ehall I bother to enumerate the cruelt



inflictod.uron ee while confined in sundry Texng jails and at Leavennorth Penitentiary.
Most of thea are ndequately detailed in my. 1967 Memorantua in Support of Petition for
Writ of Habeas Corpus, sworn to an? subecribed before William Re Kartin ta Corser center

of the CIA's Dirty Tricke Division, who by his own admiscicn is etill in “the reserves").
But I ehall opine that if President Kennedy hat not zet his denise when and where he did,

While ay return to the fold of the CIA in May 1963 any have been the only “practical
thing": for me'to do, it definitely tas not preticated on ay financial situation, asa f
old bank account: pasabooks will: substantiate Tam not quite the ‘mercenary ¢ ur. Lucey
has portrayed). Norwas it ause of any peculiar allegiance to thoso who had tossed me
on the scrap heap for the. sake of exyediency 4} yeara earlier, love of country, aascchia=
tic tendencies or wont of further intrigue, And while. it retains axionatic in my mind
that the aole roquisite for one's use by. the agoncy ie his qualification to fit into
whatever’ may happen to be the® schemo of thinga, even thie did not apply in ay
circumatance, not really. I agreed to go back out into the cold, so to speak, strictly
for personal. reasons and I think the explanation is wisely left at that for now.

My mission inside East Gerzany - if indeed it wae a mission - was neithér as well=
defined nor as elementary aa Mr. Lucey has perceived. I. ‘am eure the CIA knows all it
‘needs to know about American deféctoro’in Berlin and the modus operandi of the UfS. In
fact, ‘the mission waa not directed not East: Germany, per 6. Preparations bore the
tradeaarks of an authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the anin to another
nation, Thet I was unable to cozprehend the Gorman lnnguare, that I had been a recent,
uneilling guest of the U.S. Attorney General, branded a Communist in the public recorda,
ete, merely. served to strengthen an already plausible cover built up by chance rather
then by design. Paradoxically, the chinke in the ‘armor were that the cover mae not
wholly untrue, tho fs (unlike the FBI) not in the Least irresponsible to the laws and
policios of ite govornaent. In ‘tho pest I had engaged in certain covert intelligence
sctivities hositlo to other socialist states, to which = as an integral part of ay
cover = I freely confessed. Oddly enough, howevar, my mentors from Langely had negldcted
to:tell ae during ‘the briefings that these provious activities constituted a violation of

warranting a maximum penalty of death upon conviction.
vertence or by plan I found nyself in a not ‘altogether unfntilinr predicanent. If
onfosned to ay real mission, aseuming that it waa genuine, without doudt I would
jon spared execution, probably even. escaped long-tera iaprisonment. | inatead, I.
gelected what I considered to be a better alternative... . and gained ay freedom. | Aa
for ay treatment by the MfS, from begining to ond it was for more gentle than that
experienced beneath the cudgel of the U.S. Departnent- of Justice.

With regard to oy eorital status and ay children, the foremost area that urs Lucey
appoare to have exploited, I. have never claimed that’ "Unclo Sam hides my (anily" or
stated that FBI and CIA agents deliberately isolated me from ay wife and children; nor
have I claimed that the agency ueed the promise of reuniting ae vith ay farily as part of
the incentive for accepting the assignzent in the GDR, My accusations in this rospect
centered around my children and they were leveled at tho State Department as the result
of a promise made to me shortly after my release from the GDR. Since returning to the
United St lnet spring a source has informed me that my wife waa granted a
final decree of divorce at sore period during ay imprisonaent in the USA and although I
have never been servod with a copy of tho docree or other notification of divorcee (or
notice of a divorce hearing) I Ro cause to dispute the advisement. :

Lastly, concerning the aspersions cast on ay sanity, at this writing permit me to
y only ‘that I have never in xy life been certified peychatic by any U.S. aedical
authority .or adjudicated aentally-incospetent in a court of law, notwithstanding the
conflicting legal and medical opinicns aa to my mental condition on the day of ay arrest
