(3) Maheu_ involvement _in CIA domestic activities

In 1954 Maheu was recruited by the CIA for use
by the CIA's Office of Security for "extremely sensitive
cases." He was paid $500 per month on the condition that
he move into his own private office (he had previously
shared office space with Carmine Bellino -- associated in
the past with illegal wiretapping) and be "on call" by the
Office of Security for sensitive assignments. The CIA doc-
uments do not indicate how long a period Maheu was on the
$500 per month retainer, but it would appear that this re-
@ tainer was only for the first year or two, i.e. 1954-55.
It was at this time that Maheu was first starting out in
the investigative area and in fact it was in the year 1954
that Maheu first formed his private investigations company
of Robert A. Maheu Associates. Through the previous testi-
mony of CIA official O'Connell we know that Maheu was used

for wiretapping and surreptitious entries. O'Connell re-

calls one specific incident of Maheu entering Gn5§

Sey in Washington, D. C. for the CIA. Maheu can pro-

vide detailed testimony on exactly what he did for the CIA,

how often and where.

(a) Wiretapping/Surveillance of Aristotle Onassis

In July of 1954 Maheu was hired by British
shipping interests sponsored by Stavros Niarchos. During his
employment for Niarchos Maheu conducted a surveillance of
Aristotle Onassis in New York City. CIA documents indicate
that Maheu stated that he had technical coverage (wiretap)
of Onassis' New York apartment and that he used one of his
employees, John Frank, to perform electronic surveillance.
The CIA documents also indicate that Maheu hired a technician
by the name of "Leon" to perform this surveillance and that

@ the CIA "may have" been given some of the information
received by Maheu from this technical coverage. Maheu can
provide an explanation for exactly what he did and what con-
nection he had with the Agency in this venture against

Aristotle Onassis.

Maheu was used by the CIA in 1957, 1958, and

any hearsay knowledge that he might have about the use of

the CIA's Technical Services Division for other such pro-
jects or programs. Note: TSD also produced the poison

pills for Castro and, allegedly, poison virus for Lumumba.

(c) Maheu's Provision of Cover
Facilities for CIA Agents

Maheu provided the CIA with (1) use of Maheu's

office as a live address for cover, (2) assistance in ob-
taining safehouses, (3) use of Maheu to provide cover employ-

ment for CIA personnel both in the United States and abroad.

In this regard, CIA documents establish that Maheu provided

documents establish that Maheu provided cover for a CIA

employee[|from August 1968 to December 1970.
Again, it is unknown exactly what this Agency employee did

in that country. Maheu should know details.
