lL RI; Tracing continuing,
2. The following additional information has been obtained since
reference:

a. The New Orleans States-Item of 3 March 1967 stated that
New York radio station WINS said that it had learned from reliable
sources that GARRISON believes that President Kennedy wag
assassinated by "a group of plotters directed from Cuba."" WINS
reporter Doug Edelson said that the source has access to GARRISQN's
files and that, according to the files, "after an abortive CIA invasion
of Cuba, Castro put out an execution order on the President,"

b. A memorandum of 1 May 1967 by Mr. Richard H,
Lansdale, Associate General Counsel, advises that GARRISON
“intends to demand that CIA furnish him with the photograph of Oswald
eptering or exiting the Mexico City Embassy."

c James Phelan is the author of the lead article in the
Saturday Evening Post of 6 May 1967, headed "A Plot to Kill Kennedy?
Rusk to Judgment in New Orleans". The following key points chiefly
concern GARRISON: :

() Phelan new GARRISON in 1963, when he spent
ten days with him, obtaining material for a laudatory piece
called, "The Vice Man Cometh".

{2} GARRISON and Phelan met in Las Vegas on 5 and
6 March 1967, and Phelan conducted ten hours of interviews.
vw GARRISON gave Phelan a memorandum of an interview con-
AY ducted with Perry RUSSO by Andrew J. SCIAMBRA, "a 3l-year-
a

old assistant D.A. just a year out of law school" wha interviewed
RUSSO for three hours and took copious notes. GARRISON also
gave Phelan a transcript of what RUSSO said four days later, on
1 March 1967, while under hypnosis. The SCIAMBRA report



13-00000

made no mention of 2 plot among

FERRIE, and
SHAW to killanyone, The 3, 5UU-word report also made no
reverence to a party at FERRIEZ's apartment. it did aot
contain a positive identification of Lee Harvey OSWALD as
‘Leon OSWALD. Shown a picture of Clay SHAW, RUSSO had
not identified him as "BERTRAND", The SCIAMBRA report
specified that RUSSO had seen SHAW only twice. It did not
say that SHAW knew OSWALD.

ae)

(3) On 27 February 1967, according to a second
SCIAMBRA report, RUSSO was given sodium pentothal and
then ''did make passing reference to the party at which the
plot was discussed", but did so only siter prompting by
SCIAMBRA, who wrote, 'I then asked him if he could remem-
ber any of the details about Clay Bertrand being up in FERRIE's
apartment,"

(4) ‘Two days later Dr. Esmond FATTER placed
RUSSO under hypnosis (he did so three times in all). When
RUSSO made no mention of a party or plot, FATTER directed
him to see "a picture of FERRIE's apartment and there are
several people in there and there is a white-haired man. Tell
me about it," RUSSO complied but made no mention of SHAW,
"BERTRAND", or a plot. FATTER then ordered him to see
this picture: "There will be Bertrand, Ferrie and Cswald and
they are going to discuss a very important matter and there is
another man and girl there and they are talking about assassina-
ting somebody. Look at it and describe it tome.’ RUSSO
then told the story that he subsequently gave in testimony.

{5} Phelan advised GARRISON of the profound differences
between the first SCIAMBRA report and the eventual RUSSO.
testimony. GARRISON permitted Phelan to question SCIAMBRA
directly, in GARRISON's presence, SCIAMBRA said that he
must have forgotten to incinde the party and its participanis.
When Phelan suggested consulting his original notes, SCIAMBRA
said that he had burned them, Phelan asked Dr. FATTER
where he got the information used in questioning RUSSO under
hypnosis, and FATTER said it came from GARRISON's office.

SUBJECT : Gordon Duane NOVEL

Ll RI - No record,

2. The following additional information has been obtained since
the date of reference: ?

a. The New Orleans Times Picayune of 19 April 1967 states
that Gordon Duane NOVEL (see Enclosure 19 of reference), then living
in Columbus, Ohio, was the subject of extradition charges signed
17 April 1967 By Acting Governor C.C. Aycock. The charges concern
couspiracy to burglarize the munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana, -
in 1961. On 18 April 1967 NOVEL stated in an article copyrighted by
the Dallas Daily News that GARRISON is conducting his probe to
further his political career, "The whole GARRISON investigation
thing is fiction," NOVEL added. "I know the full story from working
as the prosecutor's security chief." GARRISON, however, has said
that NOVEL never worked for him. NOVEL added, "I think GARRI-
SON will expose some CIA operations in Louisiana,"

b. The New Orleans States-Item of 25 April 1967 states that
NOVEL “has told a number of friends and intimates he was a CIA
operative and will use this role to battle GARRISON's chargea,..
if he is returned to New Orleans to face accusations that he burglarized
an oil service company's munitions bunker in nearby Terrebonne
Parish," Steven PLOTKIN, attorney for NOVEL, refused to confirm
or deny his client's statements, Sergio ARCACHA Smith {see En-
closure 2 of reference) is also accused by GARRISON of helping to
pian the theft of the munitions. The article adds, "To friends and
associates, NOVEL has said that the munitions burglary was no
burglary at all -- but a war materials pickup made at the direction
of his CIA contact." He has described the Houma bunker as a CIA
cache for munitions destined for use in the April 1961 invasion at the
Bay of Pigs. NOVEL has claimed that he worked for CIA in New
Orleans before April 1961. "Part of his job, he contends, was to
operate the Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front for CIA
communications, With funds funneled to him by the CIA, NOVEL



says he prepared special radio commercials used on 300 stations

in the U.S, and Canada. Their cryptographic messages, he claims,
were to alert agents to the invasion date. The commercials adver-
tised aluminum Christmas trees, he says, and the key alert code
names were 'Star Chriatmas Trees’ and 'Holiday Trees'. In late
1960, $72, 000 worth of radio time was placed by the agency, On the
day the munitions were to be picked up, he says, he was called by his
CIA contact and told to join a group which was ordered to transport
munitions from the bunker to New Orleans. ... He says he made
the trip in his own automobile, a Lincoln, and met several people
there -- all of them allegedly acting for the CIA.. He identifies

them as FERRIE, ARCACHA, several Cubans, and another figure in
the case. Thay loaded the boxes of ordnance on trucks, he continues,
and returned to New Orleans where the explosives were dropped in
three spots. -- FERRIE's home, NOVEL's office building, and the
office of . . . former FBI agent. . . Guy BANISTER. {see Enclosure
3 of reference), NOVEL claims the munitions were eventually taken
by boat to Cuba for ‘a diversionary Bay of Pigs operation, GARRISON,
however, says the burglary occurred three months aiter the Bay of
Pigs. He adds that the Houma bunker was leased by the Schlumberger
Well Services Co. cf Houston, Texas. "Schlumberger officials say
they know nothing of any CIA operations in connection with their
magazine, where oil field service equipment and certain low-yield
explosives are stored." : 7s

Cc. An AP wire dispatch of 26 April 1967 from New Orleans
adds, "In Columbus, NOVEL said today that ‘the statements that I
worked for the CIA are absolutely incorrect, . .. The events of :
1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion, are none of anybody's business,
including Mr. GARRISON's, '!

3. RI has no record of the Evergreen Advertising Agency. There

is, however, a record of "Evergreen Enterprise," listed as "cover for
illegal activities", The pertinent document will be obtained and studied.

2. Yhere are extensive CLA traces on this company and on

pertinent to the GARRISON investigation.

2. A report of 20 April 1947 from the New Orleans office
od the FB states that a confidential source who is a representative
of a well-ksows news media sald on 20 April that Cerden NCVEL
bas reportedly stated that he was employed by CIA and thst the
Houma burglary was aet an actual burglary. He contended that ClA
had sn. arrangement with the SCHLUMBERGER Co, (see below) to
keep ammunition, bomb casings, and other materisi ix the bunker,
leased by SCHLUMBERGSR. He said that he and Sargio ARCACHA
Smith were otiil employed by CIA. “The source advised that accord-
ing to information developed to date Schlumberger becams upast
over the Bay of Pigs invasion and wanted te get out af their contract
with the CLA. Arrangements were pads about thres months aRer
the...invasion for the... material...to be taken out by Novel and his

3- The Domestic Cantact Service {DCS) informed CI/R&A
on 27 April 1967 that the New Orleans office of the SCHLUMBERGER
Welk uvveying Corporation ls 2 branch of the main offices in Houston,
Texas. The company, however, is French-owned. The DOS office
in New Orlaaas was in touch with Charlee 4, DOH, district manager
of the New Crieans SCHLUMBERGER office, in order to interview him
about a business trip to Reme in June 1955. There has been no subse-
quent comtact. However, the DCS has been and still is in touch with

i

GJHLUMBERGER and Co. in Housten and subsidiary citices alse-
where, The most recent of such contacts occurred on 22 March
1967 in Minneapolis. All coutact must be approved by the main
SCHLUMBERGER office. Because of French control, DUS cealings
with the firm have been circumspect.

4. The Cffice of Security alas advised on 27 .pril 1967 that
questioning of four employess of the Office of Logistics has shown
that the only arms bunker in ths New Crieans area used by CLA was
the Belle Chasse Ammuninion Depot, a deactivated Navy instalation
eight milea from New Orleans. There is no present reason to beHeve .
that the Agency hae been associated in any way with the Houma Air
