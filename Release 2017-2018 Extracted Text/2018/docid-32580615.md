On 7/24/63 and 7/25/63, according to LA 4396-c*,
- ROSSELLI was at his Los Angeles apartment and on ‘7/24/63
engaged in conversations over the telephone with two unknown
girls.

Fisur on 7/25/63 revealed ROSSELLI probably visited
HARRY DRUCKER's Barber Shop in Beverly Hills. He left there
about 1:30 p.m. and proceeded to the Beverly Hills office of
‘the Dunes Hotel where he remained about five minutes and then
went to the Friars Club in Beverly Hills.
