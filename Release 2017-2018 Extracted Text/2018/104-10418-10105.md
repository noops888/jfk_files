Vladimir KUZNETSOV is Vladimir Nikolayevich KUZNETSOV
who arrived in Brussels in early October 1976 as First Secretary
“in the Soviet Embassy. Served as cultural attache and first

secretary in The Hague July 1971 - early September 1974.

KUZNETSOV

While Cultural Attache KUZNETSOV is not an identified KGR officer,

he is certainly suspect either as an 1.0. or a co-optee. He re-
placed a KGB co-optee and is frequently observed in the company of
known KGR officers. It goes without saying that his position affords
him numerous opportunities to make contacts of all sorts.

2. We do not believe the evidence cited by the Gtation

in paragraph two of Reference is strong enough to consider Cultura
Attache KUZNETSOV a suspect intelligence officer or cooptee. KUZ-
NETSOV's replacing a Soviet who was suspected of heing a KGP cooptee
does not make KUZNETSOV himself suspect, and although he has been
frequently observéd in the Netherlands with known KGR officers, we
note that Reference cites two instances of association with the pre-
sumed GRU Resident, T. 9. ANTSIMOV. In short, we believe it prema-
ture to attempt to draw any conclusions at all about KUZNETSOV's in- Be
telligence status, and concur with (SYMPATHIZER'S) not including him in
the preseumed KP Residency.
