Vladimir KUZNETSOV is Vladimir Nikolayevich KUZNETSOV

who arrived in Brussels in early October 1976 as First Secretary

in the Soviet Embassy. Served as cultural attache and first

secretary in The Hague July 1971 - early September 1974.

KUZNETSOV

While Cultural Attache KUZNETSOV is not an identified KIR officer,

he is certainly suspect either as an

I.n. or a co-optee.

He re-

placed a KGB co-optee

and is frequently observed in the

company of

known KGR officers.

It goes without saying that his position affords

him numerous opportunities to make contacts of all sorts:

?. We do not helieve the evidence cited by the (Station

in paragraph two of Reference is strong enough to consider Cultural

Attache KUZNETSOV a suspect intelligence officer or cooptee.

KUZ-

VETSOV's replacing a Soviet who was susnected of heing a KGR cooptec

does not make KUZNETSOV himself suspect, and although he has been

frequently observed in the Netherlands with known KGR officers, we

note that Reference cites

instances of association with the pre-

sumed GRU Resident, I. D. ANISIMOV.

we believe it prema-

to attempt to

draw any conclusions at all about KuzNETsnis in-

telligence status, and concur with[SYMPATHIZER'S not including him in

the presumed KGP

Residency.
