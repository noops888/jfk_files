1, We are sending under separate cover a copy of en Scbassy dispatch 246 4,
on the above subject written by Costille at the request of the Comuelor
of Enbassy, We have never attenpted to keep our contact sith Golub unter
cover and have feriodically informed the Counselor of the status of this
contact. He hae aprroved snd even encouraged this contact and has sugcested
bringing in other Exbassy officials who might strike up friendships 1th
Soviet officials other than Golub. :

2, At the most recent Colub-Costille lunch on 3 August, Golub again
hinted at an estrangeent between hinself and his wife, who is still inthe
Soviet Union, He asked Costille if Costille could fix hir tp xith a Finnish
girl for some evening. Arrangecents have been made for a nicht on the town
this Saturday with Costille and date and Golub and a trusted Minish girl
we are certain will give Golub a run for his money. All details «ill be in
the next pouch, The following information came out during this lunch, Solubd .
is a Comwunist Party member having this honor bestowed upon hia at the front /
during World Wer II, He, also nentioned that practically ail Scviet diplceate ;
were CP menbers, Golub was tern in Kharkov but spent most of his pre-kerld
War II life in Kiev. He considers Kiev to be the most beautiful city in the
Soviet Union and is extremely proud of his Ukrainien backgrocad, Galub now
claims that for his next post he would prefer New York City. (TRis is a
reversal, as Golub up to this point’ has told Costille that he sculd net Like
an assignment in the U.S. because of the distance from Moscow.) whan asked
why New York rather than the Soviet Embassy in Washington, he answered that
in. New York he could be his own boss while in Weshington he wuld be tec much
under the thunk of the Anbassador, He did not eleborate on this statecent,
However, he remarked that if assigned to the U.S, he would insist on im

tensive English language training in Hoscow.

3. We would like to elaborate‘on Golub's “estrangenent® fron his wife,
since thie appears to be ebout his only vulnerability. Golub without
hesitation a number of tires:has flatly stated that he is glad his xife is

on vacation in the Scyiet Union dad that he has been enjoying his freedoas

At the lest lunch Costille asked him when his wife was returning. He answered
that he did not know and also that he did not care and intizated that she was
having @ good time in Moscow "probably with some lover." Howerer, we know
that he heare from his wife because Golub has mentioned she attended the Us 3.
exhibition in Moscow, She also phoned him on his birthday, 13 Aucust, from
sone vacation epot on the Bisck Sea. Golub has never intizated that she would
not be returning to Helsinki following her vacation. Colub has always made
these derogatory remarks about his wife rather jokingly and never out of any
despondency, He sees to think these recarks will establish hin as “one of
tha boya,# :
