Supplemental Data: ESPINOSA flew Air France from Orly

Airport (confirmed by cachet in pp) on 29 May 1965 and on

arrival in NYC the same day contacted an INS Agent named

CAVASANJIAN (ph) who, on the basis of information in the

story of ESPINOSA which appeared to affect U.S. security,

notified the FBI.

Special Agent Frank O'BRIEN of the NY

Field Office of the FBI interviewed ESPINOSA on 2 May 1965.

The FBI notified us on 3 lay.

I saw ESPINOSA on 4 May in the

NY field office of the FBI.

Frank O'BRIEN was present.

(O'BRIEN said that INS at Washington, D.C. apparently had

received a report and had notified FBI headquarters from which

a supervisor had telephoned O'BRIEN to inquire whether O'BRIEN

knew about aspects of ESPINOSA's story with derogatory allega-

3.

After CASTRO took over I left Cuba and engaged in

anti-Castro activities.

I got shot in the process,

I was

betrayed by some of the Cuban exiles when I was going to bomb

Cuba, I saw how the CIA bungled and I became bitter.

I was

bitter about Rolando too.

I thought that he had turned

communist.

I sent him a

message a long time ago, telling him

that he was a traitor and no friend of mine.

That was when a

Pan American stewardess whom

he liked came

to me with a message

from him about how he was still a friend of mine and things

were not like they seemed:

I got mad and told her to tell him

off for me and I showed her the bullet wound in my leg that I

had because I was fighting CASTRO and those with him like

Rolando.

Afterwards I did not hear from Rolando until just a

little while ago. MissiRin-s

It was in lay when I got a letter from an old friend,

Act tuls FERNANDEZ"He had written to me before to let me know

that he is working for the CIA in Paris.

This letter in May

was pretty confusing but Luis made it clear that there was.

something very important, that it involved Rolando CUBELAS,

hat Rolando wanted me to go to Paris on an urgent matter,

and that another friend, Luis TRASANCOS, knew something about

it.

The letter said that the CIA knew about this and that

Luis FERNANDEZ thought maybe the CIA already had told me to

go to Paris, although he was not sure.

I decided to go to Paris because of the mention of

Rolando.

had taken my old Cuban passport when I was

in training in Guatemala and never returned it.

Also, because

I got caught when I tried to bomb Cuba, the INS had warned me

not to travel outside the U.S. saying I could go to jail for

five years and I could not get a re-entry permit and all that.

However, I checked with an INS officer who knew me.

that probably the INS was not so interested in me anymore and

I probably could get re-entry.

Because the letter was so

pressing in my travelling at once, I decided not to go through

I went to Florida to see my.

brother, Rene,

residing at. 5000 SW 69th Avenue, Miami. He arranged through

some friends whom I don't know to get me a false Cuban passport.

The pp has number 423335, is dated 19 November 1964,

name of the source, and has entry and departure

cachets for London on 4,

10 and 21 May

1965; for Le Bourget

on 7 and 21 May; and for Orly on 29 May

I bought a

ticket and left for Paris without having any

trouble.

I am

not sure about the dates and the sequence of travel because

everything

was so hurried.

I went to London as well as to

Paris and I tried to go to Spain but had to turn back.

Anyway

I remember the important things.

6. At Paris I telephoned Luis TRASANCOS who invited

When I got there, I found Alberto

I called Luis aside to tell him

this but Luis explained that BLANCO was instructed by Rolar do

CUBELAS to see me, that Loco and Rolando are against CASTRO,

and that my seeing Loco was the reason that it was so urgent

7. Rolando CUBELAS had been in Paris a couple of months

earlier and, according to El loco,

bad left a letter instructing

El Loco did not have

the letter with him but I believe it.

I know that Cubans are

liars and exaggerate and are insecure and all that is wrong

about them, but I know what is good about them and how to check

on things.

So I cross-questioned El Loco and others until I

was sure that they told me the truth.

What I am telling you

Is what I found out from El loco, confirmed later through r

Mago ROBRENO, and confirmed in part through questioning others

who know parts of the story but not all of it.

Rolando CUBELAS plans to kill Fidel and Raul CASTRO

and other key men in the regime.

Rolando has a house at

Veradero Beach adjacent to the house of fidel, so it is easy

for Rolando to get Fidel any time.

The idea is not just to

kill Fidel but to change everything in Cuba. so Rolando has the

cooperation of other people whose names I do not know except

for El LOCO BLANCO and El Mago ROBRENO and ALMEIDA.

Rolando is

very security conscious so he does not want people

to know any more than is necessary.

You must understand the

danger to these people.

What I can tell you now is that El Loco

has his faults and so does ROBRENO but both worship Rolando and

are trustworthy insofar as be is concerned. El Loco is back

inside Cuba now.

El Nago Robreno is in Madrid and can get

messages in and out. He is responsible for killing many of

my friends and he kicked their dead bodies afterwards, so I

do not like him and maybe later I shall kill him;but for now I

believe that he is useful and can be trusted for the matters

which involve Rolando and the plot against Fidel CASTRO.

Some of the CIA people are not trustworthy. This is

what bothers Rolando CUBELA$ and El Loco and El Mago and me too.

This is why Rolando wants me to get his message through.

wants an answer fast.

The message is that CUBELAS and the

others with him are able to kill Fidel and others in the regime,

but they need some help and they need to know whether the CIA

and the U.S. Government are with them and willing to support

them or not.

If the answer is affirmative, Rolando will send

details about what he needs and so forth. Time is important

because Rolando says that he cannot delay more than three or

four months.

That is the maximum.

would find out and arrest everyone if there is more delay.

rolando will send someone to see you if you agree to support

Among other things Rolando will need some money, Cuban

not American, or some gold or something because some people

have to be bought.

Also he might need help getting people out.

Anyway he needs to know your stand.

El Loco and El Mago said that on 5 or 6 June someone

is passing through Madrid en route from Prague to Habana and

that this person could carry the answer to Rolando.

not say how I should get the answer to El Mago but I suppose

I can fly to Madrid to give it in person and, if you want, one

of you can accompany me.

I myself suspect that Rolando will

move earlier than in two or three months.

I believe that

26 July is a good date because all the chief targets will be

asserbled so it will be easier to get them all fast, but Rolando

did not send me this as his plan.

11. El Loco and El Mago have access to ary Cuban Embassy

in Europe and these embassies are engaged in contacts with

communists and in subversion.

The same applies to embassies in

Africa.

El Loco and El Mago could have been giving you valuable

information analong.

Yet your people play security games and

do not use people like this. Instead you use unreliable and

risky people.

El Loco was in Europe as an officer of Cuban Security®

codes, ciphers and microfilm to prove this and he showed

them to one of your people in Madrid. What better proof. do you

want? What did

you do about it? Nothing.

Yet this man, a

member of the Cuban Security, offered to work as a double for

you and he tried to tell you about Rolando's plot. Now he is

back in Cuba.

As the result of his frustration over your

attitude, he was in terrible mental state when I saw him. Had

I been your people in the CIA, I'd not have let him return that

In his upset he could do something rash which might blow

the whole operation.

13. El Mago ROBRENO is a delinquent.

He shot an American

in Cuba over some private disagreement.

He shot a police

officer.

He beat up his wife, now his ex-wife.

This is apart

from his killings on behalf of CASTRO in the trials of counter-

revolutionaries.

This is why Fidel wanted ROBRENO out of Cuba.

ROBRENO is a delinquent, a trouble maker and an embarrassment.

In the Cuban embassies in Europe, they know this.

not want trouble and they see him.

They do not believe that he

is counter-revolutionary or plotting against the regime. He is

useful.

14. I sent El Mago a ticket so he could travel from

Madrid to Paris to see me.

This is because your people in

Paris said they could not help me get a visa to Spain and

because when I tried to enter Spain illegally I ran into

trouble and turned back.

As I said before, I wanted to get

confirmation of what El Loco had told me.

El Mago confirmed

everything.

Now to mention the problems about your people, I must

explain that these are incidental to the real reason for seeing

you which is to give you the message from Rolando. I did that.

16.

Rolando said that he did not trust L

and did not want to see him even though

wanted to

meet Rolando when Rolando was in Europe last.

I have known

for years, since he was in Habana and belonged to

the Vedado Tennis Club and was drunk by three p.u. every single

day.

Recently in Madrid, he has set up a Cuban girl in an

apartment and he got her a job in a Cubainerugee office.

She

stole files or the contents of files from/

office. She is

working for the regime and L

name is Tota.

This is a man who is

For example,

he told you

that he has the confidence of Ambassador CARRILIO in Paris,

that

he could become better friends with CARRILLO if you supplied

money with which to buy confiscated jewelry from CARRILLO. So

you gave the money, the amount TEPEDING asked for, TEPEDINO

paid less for the jewelry to CARRILLO, TEPEDINO made a nice

profit for himself, and CARRILLO thought it all very funny.

CARRILLO told friends that be knows that TEPEDINO is working

for you CIA people and won't tell TEPEDINO anything which

CARRILLO does not want you to hear. CARRILLO told all this to

El LOCO BLANCO.

Also you should know that TEPEDINO tells you that he

agrees with you but when he is with others who criticze you,

he tells them that he agrees with them. He bas been acting as

he kept for himself and none of which he contributed to the

About your Paris people, Bob, Dick and Maureen who

Maureen does not know when she is being kidded.

Luis TRASANCOS

and El Loco BLANCO saw her in Paris.

They jokingly asked if

She would work for theSoviets for twice what you people are

paying her.

She paled and swallowed the story.

After El Loco

told me

the story,

I talked to Maureen. I confirmed it.

Maureen is the go-between for Luis TRASANCOS and Dick.

The

problem is that we can't be sure that we can get the story from

Rolando CUBELAS to the CIA chiefs by using your Paris people.

We don't want Luis TRASSNCOS or Luis FERNANDEZ to know more

than they need.

This is just good security.

They know enough

about the general plan but they need not know details..

Others who know quite a bit are ARTIME and his aide,

QUINTEROS. I don't tbink it good that ARTIME should be to

involved but CUBELAS needed some help. CUBELAB met botl

ARTIME and TEPEDINO in Europe.

They agreed on a few reference

points on the north coast of Cuba as possible exfiltration

Places from which ARTIME could pick up CUBELAS' people if some-

thing goes wrong• Also ARTIME gave something to CUBELAS which

CUBELAS took back to Cuba in his bag.

it was a rdio or not but you people ought to see to it that
