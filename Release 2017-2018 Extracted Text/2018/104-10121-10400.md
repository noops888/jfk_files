1. ANTI-CASTRO ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

Efforts of Cuban exiles based in the United States since

the fall of Batista and the assumption of power by the Castro

regime on 1

January 1959 have been characterized by continu-

ally shifting alliances aimed at securing for their leaders

a paramount position in any successor government in their

homeland.

Programs have been enunciated by individual leaders,

and funds solicited. Consider-

able propaganda has been published, and leaflets attacking

Castro have been dropped over Cuba

periodically. - Some mili-

tary and paramilitary training has been undertaken, particularly

in the Doninican Republic where a force ranging from a claimed

80 men to several thousand has been training for the past

nine months. Some exiles claim to have armed followers in

Cuba as well as a larger number of sympathizers.

There has

been one abortive invasion attempt.

These efforts have been weakened, however, by rivalries

petween the more prominent exiles for leadership of any for

mal anti-Castro movement established, and their failure to

agree on any program.

Their activities also have been affected

by the fact that most of the exiles were connected either

actively of passively with the Batista regime.

They recognize,

although they do not always admit this, that Batista's rule

is still too unpopular with the mass of Cubans for them to

engage in a successful effort to overthrow Castro unless they

are supported by a force far larger than any can command at

present.

These rivalries plus Castro's followers' long training

in revolutionary methods appear to have enabled Castro to

learn the plans of most of the alliances formed thus far well

math la

before they are put into action.

Nevertheless there has been, and continues to be, a general

recognition by most of the more prominent exiles that

they

must unite if they are to succeed in removing the present re-

gime. The most important potential leaders of any such move-

ment

to emerge so far are listed below under

separate headings.

When mention is made of military measures to eliminate

the castro regime attention inevitably focuses on General

Jose tieuterio PEDRALA y CabIera. Nile opinions ditter

as to his suitability for the role of leader of a military

attack on the Castro forces,

is regarded by the most

prominent and

most active exile leaders in the United States

as the only military leader in a position to take effective

in the field against Castro.

The forces at his disposal in the Dominican Republic,

the loyalties he can conmand within Cuba, and the help

led by 100

former Officers and Non-Commissioned officers of

Cuban origin.

The remainder of his force would be made up

of Spaniards, Yugoslavs, Germans, and perhaps a

few Dominicans. (

PEDRAZA has

expressed his willingness to work with General

Martin DIAZ Tamayo and Colonel Ramon BARQUIN and would wel-

come their cooperation but he has never hinted that he would

turn over leadership of his forces to either.

Forner Castro supporter Francisco RODRIGUEZ Couceiro,

who claims to have been one of the prime organizers of two

anti-Castro groupings The Anti-Communist Crusade (CRAC) and

The Christian Democratic Action (ADC) has backed PEDRAZA as

the military leader of

Rodriguez claims to have visited the

General late in October 1959 and to have reached an agreement

whereby Pedraza committed hinself to clean up his force of

men in the Dominican Republic and put them under the direc

tion and control of the ADC.

Rodriguez asserts that the

agreement provides for the

elimination of all but Cuban

nationals

from the forces in the Dominican Republic under

Pedraza.

Fabio FREYRE, a wealthy young Cuban--who also claims

to be the founder of the ADC--has made known his connections

with Pedraza and claims to have drawn up points of agreement

with him. (3)

Freyre has stated that General PEDRAZA is

army would follow.

Dr. Emilio NUNEZ Portuonde, now resident in Washington,

D.C., and one of the more prominent anti-Castro exiles, has

consistently tried to align the various anti-Castro elements

in the United States, Mexico, and Cuba behind General Pedraza. (

Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling, who

General Pedraza's service under Fulgencio Batista has

left a bad taste in the mouths of many Cubans who hated the

Batista dictatorship as vehemently as they now detest the

Castro regime.

There seems to be reasonable doubt that Dr.

CUERVO-RUBIO, whom RODRIGUEZ Couceiro has claimed CRAC sup-

ports as a

presidential candidate, would support Pedraza.

CUERVO-Rubio is reported to have stated that responsible

opposition to Castro inside Cuba would be reluctant to asso-

ciate with Pedraza and might join in the fight against him

should he attempt an invasion.

Some of these people have

repeatedly expressed the tear that lastro might use such

an invasion as a pretext to suppress all opposition.

Prom-

inent Orthodox Party leader Antonio VARONA also is reported

to be worried about the possibility of an invasion of Cuba

by Pedraza, to whom he is bitterly opposed and has sworn

that he and his followers would join with the Castro brothers

in repelling any invasion led by Pedraza. (8) It is considered

a distinct possibility that a Pedraza led invasion would play

into Castro's hands, leaving internal opposition no alterna-

tive but to lavasiast (9, in a national effort to repel a

It is known that FREYRE'S ADC which supports Pedraza

for military leader would welcome the assistance and the

support of the former Chief of the Revolutionary Air Force

Major Pedro Luis DIAZ-Lanz.

However, DIAZ-Lanz has made

it very evident that he wants no part in military affairs

run by General Pedraza whom he categorizes as an enemy of

Recent evi-

one of the first to declare his candidacy for the

leadershir

of an anti-Castro movement.

A tormer politician

and diplomat Nunez was Cuba's delegate

to the United Nations

from 1952 until 1958.

During this period he cooperated with

the US delegation and was outspokenly critical of-the UssR.

Most Cubars

in the United States, and in those Latin American

countries where he and his followers have solicited support

for their anti-Castro activities are under the impression that

he has some type of commitment with the US Government.

though

he continues to be mentioned, along with Carlos

MARQUEZ Sterling, as the most likely candidate for provisional

president of a successor government to Lastro, some sources

nave alleged that he would not make an effective president. (1)

Nunez' announced aim is the overthrow of the Castro re-

gime and its replacement by a civil government friendly to

the US and excluding individuals associated with Batista.

To this end he and his immediate followers have published

newsletter and

periodically dropped leaflets over Cuba at-

tacking Castro.

of 1959. Nunez as recently as 14 December 1959 still

claimed to be the leader of Pedraza's group but the General

had previously asserted that he was disposed to work with

soth Nunez and Carlos MARQUEls terling but he proferred the

latter as Interin president.

Another possible adherent of Nunez is Pedro DIAZ-Lanz,

who is reported to have declared that he, and other with

whom he is working, would consider Nunez

acceptable if he

should divorce himself from Trujillo.

A step in this direc-

tion was taken by Nunez at the end of December when,

irritated by Trujillo's reluctance to permit a Pedraza

invasion of Cuba from the Dominican Republic, he told

C. Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling

Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling comes from a family with a dis-

tinguished record

in Cuban History.

He was born in 1899 in

Camaguay and received his education in Cuba, graduating

from the University of Havana with a law degree in 1920.

Three years later he became a professor at the University.

It was from the same Univeristy that he was removed in 1959

by Castro forces. MARQUEZ Sterling told American officials

that Fidel Castro had been one of his students at the Univer-.

sity of Havana 1945-1947, and that Fidel had been

Washington while his father was Ambassador.

Later he re-

entered politics and became

the establishment of the

Ortodoxo Party in 1946.

Previously Marquez had presided

over the drafting of the Constitution of 1940.

Major DIAZ-Lanz has gained considerable publicity for his

break with

21 October 1959.

His brother Narcos, who was Inspector General

of the Revolutionary Air Force (FAR)

The snall group about Diaz-Lanz in conversation with U.S.

officials and private citizens has steadfastly refused to

have anything to do with former Batista officials while they

have stated

their intention to take any measures to insure

the downfall of Castro. (p)

In July 1959 Pedro DIAZ-Lanz stated that there is no

connection whatsoever between the anti-Castro torces in cuba

and those in the United States.

in September 1959 Jose SUAREZ Nunez, a Cuban exile arrived

in Miami to deliver instructions from Batista to Piedra to

the PIEDRA group has three planes which they would like to

use during the next 60 days to set fire to sugar cane

fields by dropping incendiaries.

However, FERNANDEZ bemoaned

the fact that tight United States controls in Florida were

hampering their activities.

Fernandez said that he is in

contact with Guatemalans and Nicaraguans and that he and

Piedra are responsible for military operations.
