Memo to Mr. Belmont

Re: Central Intelligence Agency

Information Received from James

Angleton

•Intelligence division. Angleton handles special cases of a various

nature and he is usually given considerable freedom and leeway in

directing the operations of his unit.

In general, he is responsible

only to the Director of CIA. We has numerous foreign sources and

channels for developing information.

The primary source is the

representatives throughout the world. These representatives

are associated with the Free Trade Union Committee, which is sub-

sidized by the CIA. Angleton also has independent sources in the

intelligence services of france, Italy, Greece, and Great Britain.

On occasion he utilizes sources in the vaticon. Some of the men

under his control are on various foreign assignments in Europe and

are responsible only to him. Most of them are traveling under.

During the past several months Angleton has been very

cooperative with the Bureau.

He has volunteered voluminous infor

mation of interest to the Bureau and he has followed Bureau leads

in an effective manner.

Much of the information which Angleton

has furnished appears

that is, it consists of the

advantage because the Bureau has been in a position to better evaluate

the information instead of waiting for the delay and processing through

normal channels in the CIA. In addition to information regarding

security matters furnished by Angleton, he has also been of valuable

assistance by keeping the Liaison Agent apprised of administrative

changes and reorganization within the CIA. Angleton is thoroughly

informed regarding the foreign intelligence activities of his agency

and he frequently clarifies matters which the CIA sometimes camouflages

For your information, Angleton was instructed by General

Walter Bedell smith, while he was still Director of the CIA, Lto

cooperate fully with the bidison Agent and was told that ne,

Angleton, could disseminate any information he saw fit. This policy

has continued under Allen Dulles.

Since the volume of information received from Angleton

has increased the Liaison Agent has endeavored

to encourage Angleton

to establish some uniformity in the dissemination of information to

furnishing the Liaison Agent blank memoranda unich are dated,

captioned, and which carry a control number; for example, "SP]."

This number will serve as a ready reference when some question

comes up within the Bureau or the cIA.

The Liaison Agent will make

an appropriate notation on each memorandum indicating that the

documents emanate from Angleton.

It is believed advisable to set

up a control file containing a copy of each document furnished by

Angleton.

This can be done in a manner similar to

the arrangement

effected in handling reports received from,

(S)

In ulew of the above,

Angleton more or less falls into

the category of a Confidential Informant. He furnishes informatio

of a sensitzve nature and it is,

therefore, believed that when

Up to

manner; however, since the volume

has increased,

it is believed desirable to alert all Section Chiefs

regarding the

handling of information received from Angleton.
