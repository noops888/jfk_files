Memo to Mr. Belmont SEGRET Res Central Intelligence Agency
: Information Received from James
Angleton

-Intelligence @ivision. Angleton handles special cases of a various
nature and he is usually given considerable freedom and leeway in
directing the operations of hig_ unit. In general, he is responsible
only to the Director of CIA. le has numerous foreign sources
_channels for developing infor ton. The primary source is the

‘S\In addition to this, he is tn contact with

[forg pn ott makes availa
reports which ras received fro
representatives roughout the world.’ AtaEt
are sociated with the Free Trade Union Committee, which ts sub-
Sidized by the CIA. Angleton also has independent sources in the
intelligence services of France, Italy, Greece, and Great Britain.
On occasion he utilizes sources in the Vatican. Some of the men
under his control are on various foreign assignments in Europe and

are responsible only to him. Most of them are traveling under
commercial cover.

During the past several months Angleton has been very
cooperative with the Bureau. He has volunteered voluminous infor-
nation of interest to the Bureau and he has followed Bureau leads
in an effective manner. Much of the information which Angleton
has furnished appears in the raw form, that is, it consists of the
actual reports received from Angleton's sources. This has been of
advantage because the Bureau has been in a position to better evaluate
the information instead of waiting for the delay and processing through
normal channels in the CIA. In addition to information regarding
security matters furnished by Angleton, he has also been of valuable
assistance by keeping the Liaison Agent apprised of administrative
changes and reorganization within the CIA. Angleton is thoroughly \
informed regarding the foreign intelligence activities of his agency
and he frequently clarifies matters which the CIA_sometimes camouflages
with some of its cloak and dagger techniques. u)

For your information, Angleton was instfucted by General
Walter Bedell Smith, while he was still Director of the CTA, [to u)
cooperate fully with the Liaison Agent and was told that he,
Angleton, could disseminate any information he saw Site] This dis tai
has continued under Allen Dulles.

Since the volume of information received from Angleton u
has increased the Liaison Agent has endeavored to encourage Angleton
to establish some uniformity in the dissemination of information to

Meno to Mr. Belmont Res Central Intelligence Agency,
Informatton Received from James
Angleton

the Bureau, par rly with regard to that information which he
receives from Angleton is now
furnishing th taison Agent blank memoranda which are dated,

captioned, and which carry a control number; for example, "gpm.
This number will serve as a ready reference when some question
comes up within the Bureau or the CIA. The Liaison Agent will make
an appropriate notation on each memorandum indicating that the
documents emanate from Angleton. It is believed advisable to set
up a control file containing a copy of each document furnished by
Angleton. This can be done in a manner simiiadr to the arrangement
effected in handling reports received fron] Ss)

In view of the above, Angleton more or less falls into
the category of a Confidential Informant. He furnishes information
of @ sensitive nature and it is, therefore, believed that when
disseminating his data, he should be protected as a source. Up to
date Supervisors have been handling this information in a secure
manner; however, since the volume of data received from Angleton
has increased, it is believed desirable to alert all Section Chiefs
regarding the’ handling of information received from Angleton. Ry)
