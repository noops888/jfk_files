1.

Reference is inade to this Agency's teletype OUT 84747 of

6 Octaler 1968, subjerl: Current Plans of Alpha 66.

The lollumng informalion concerning Alpha 66, i Cuban

cousterreroitionary sroup, was receired in 7 September 1962 uy

another office of thia Agency from a source whose reliabilly is underwn.

Aluba 66 is incorporated under the laws ul Puertu

Rico and la cumprised of Cuban certified public accourt-

ants in exile, for the most part living in San Juan, but

with some representalives in New York and Mlar. It 19

dedicated to sabotage, harrasamen and alnilar hit and

run lype commando operationa against the Castro regime

In Cuba and intendy to carry out sis lo eight such forrays

tri the coming montha. The lirat of these la reportedly

aiready planned in detail and mil go into effect ln lbe nue

too distant future, stemming from some undisclosed luland

bage in the Caribbean. Thie orgaalzation has no political

aspirations and does not look forsard lo any position or

representation in a postwar Cubas provisional gorernment.

States Government If it will serve their best interests, how

ever, with or without Urited States Government coordination

and/or support they intend to go ahead with their plans.

This organization does need more money and equipinent

for future operations which may have to wait until they can

fet the resources that they need.

Their criticism to date

of all other Cuban exile groups is that they hare wanter

power, money, and position. Because this group wants

none of these, except supplies and cash to bet their harraßa-

ment projects underway, they are, therefure, unly tell-

Ing what they must to convince interested helpers of their

seriousness and intent and will disclose only what they

must of their plans to assure them success of this purely

agtressive, retallatory, harrassment organization. They

claim they want nothing to do with the sludent group organ-

Iration which recently shelled Habuna. As ex CPA's tbelr

very busine sellie manner requires them to give receipts

for any funds received lor help.

c. They now have enough supplies to carry out their

fire operaton successfully and maybe one other. The

organization purchased these supplies in Europe 1o aroid

being identified with atrictly United States support and

endorsement. They have approximately $30, 000. 00 luch

they coliccied from private, business subscribers, but

obriously need mure to go ahead after the first attack At

the present line they hate one bual, but ned more 10r

futuro operationa. They plan to use six to ten aien per

operation, and all of their training has so far been carried

aut in Puerto Rico. According tu their contact man in New

York, one of their tirst operations lo to blow up ail lie

power stations in Cuba.

d. Their personnel in the executive or hide rela

phase, aithough sume are doubtiess in tis perational

plase as well, are as followe:

/ 11) In No York iber leader in Adres
