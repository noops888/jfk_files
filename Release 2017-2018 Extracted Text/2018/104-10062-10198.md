1. In order to provide answers to the questions

posed in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of reference we

again have reviewed the files which were returned

to

Headquarters following the death of Winston Scott in

Mexico City.

These files are stored at the Agency

Records Center in Warrenton, Virginia.

Reference paragraph nine any files which

were maintained in the Staff on Lee Harvey Oswald

presumably have been reviewed by the members of the

House Select Committee on Assassinations.

They are

available in Mr. Russell Holmes' office.

Regarding

your request for any and all files maintained by

James Angleton and/or the CI Staff that pertain to

Mexico Surveillance Operations; there are several

hundred reels of audio film stored in the Records

Center which contain telephone coverage of the Soviet

and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City for the period

22 November 1963 through 13 December 1963.

A review

of these tapes by persons from CI Staff and LA Division

did not uncover any intormation pertinent to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

The period covered

is subsequent to the time that Oswald was known to be

in Mexico.

Attached are two listings of the Mexico City

Station files in the possession of Winston Scott at

the time of his death.

Both listings are for the same

files; the 5 May 1977 listing was prepared for LA

DivisIon, while the form 4034, dated 21 October 1971,

was prepared during a task force review of all the

files held at the Records Center. One of the objectives

of the file review at the Records Center was better

organization of our retired files.... Another was the

removal of all duplicate paper.

4. We do not have a record of any files in Mr. Scott's
