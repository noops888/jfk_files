Most documents in the ZRRIFLE files indicate that its
primary purpose was to recruit _ foreigners! tome:
GuNISWEG SURES RSEICIT yp come rans WCE TALS |
However, there area few Ore incrimin: ting’ pap which seem
to indicate a second purpose of ZRRIFLE, probably, the estab-
lishment of an assassination capab ig ty and perhaps even a
plan to use one agent,| Jose Marie (QUWIN), in an
assassination attempt in the Congo. ‘Specifically to
documents summarized, in Tab C, at paragraph 11, page 4; para-
graph 24, page 7; paragraph 2, page 8; paragraph 1, page 9;
paragraph 3, page 5

I definitely feel we should obtain copies of the
documents underlined above, as well as one which indicates
some ZRRIFLE activity in the Miami area, summarized at para-
graph 4, page 9, Tab C. Also, we should obtain a copy of the
document, referred to above, in which McCone advocated that
dissident Cubans bring about "the eventual liquidation of the
Castro/communist entourage." I have prepared a letter for
your signature requesting them, attached hereto.
