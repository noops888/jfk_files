6, Merola then atated that he had been actively engaged in gunrunning in
“Rehal£ ‘of Fidel Ceatro during the revolt against Tecieta, one stated that ”
following Castro's victory he had gore to Havana, and had been received warmly
by Bidel Castro and Camilo Cienfuegos. He furnished some detaile concerning
hese contacts, as well as his contact with Colonel "Johnnie" Abbes, head of

the Dominican secret police also a contact of his, which are being forwarded
im report forn.

2. Merola also indicated that he is very well acquainted with Antonio
de Varona, head of the FRD, and felt that he would be able to provide definite
assistance to the Frente should he be called upon. He has a 63-foot boat
aveilable which he would not be adverse to "lending" to his friends.

&. Be alse*mentioned that he realizes that we are not in a position
te be "persuasive" with Castro agents in Miami, or with firms making clandestine
shipments to Cuba via the British West Indies, Nexico or Canada. Merola
expressed the opinion that he might be able to be of considerable assistance
im "discussions" with individuals or corporations re their desisting from
lending aid to Castro.

9. We expressed appreciation for his offer of assistance but stated
that it was very unlikely that we would request any help; however, we would
be glad to hear details of any Latin American intrigue which comes to his
attention, and which could be of any significance.
