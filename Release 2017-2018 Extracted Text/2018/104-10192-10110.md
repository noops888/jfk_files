Ll... The decisive vietory of Eduardo Fred in the September 1964
Chilean Presidential election led many to hope that Christian
Democracy might develop significantly throughout Latin America
éoxpeting with Communism on ideological grounds and offering an
alternative, democratic route to social and economic progress.
Chrictian Démoeracy's advocacy of “Third Force" concepts plus
tations of enti-Yankee syndrome caused some
observers to swallow hard, but there was no denying that these
coneepts had? an cmotional appeal, This political charisma,
coupled with a commitient to, basic social refora and opposition to
Communism, and presented within an ideological framework stressing
the dignity of the huaan person, comprised a package of considerable
attractiveness to the Latin American, particularly the-student and
middle class“clements. This dispatch will review the current status
of the CD parties and the role of organizations -- ODCA, CLASC,

“Party's réform "program is being implemented with less than.

deliberate speed, no ‘progress has been made in weakening
Marxist leadership domination of the urban labor force, and
~indications are that Frei's moderation will be increasingly

challenged by the left wing of the PDC. :

: b. ‘The COPEL Party of Venezuela has strong hopes of
duslicating the victory of the Chilean Party in 1968 and
-appears to have narrowed the gap between itself (22 percent
of the clectorate in 1963) and the governing Accion Democratica
Pasty (32 percent). COPEL Secretary General Rafael Caldera,
one of the few Latin American CD leaders of international
stature, is expected to be the Party's standard beaver in his
fourth try for the presidency.

c. In El Salvador, the PDC garnered 29 percent of the
votes in the March 1966 legislative election and one of its
leaders, Jose Napoleon Duarte, retained the mayoralty of San
Salvador. In less than eix years the PDC has become the
leading opposition party. It has little chance of capturing
the presidency in 1967, but should be a strong contender by
1972, with Notre Dame-educated Mayor Duarte the likely

candidate. ’

d. The Peruvian PDC formed a coalition with the Popular
Actica (AP) Party in 1963; it currently holds two cabinet
positions. Some would argue that the Peruvian CD (with only
4 percent of the yotes in 1963) has no real future in compe-
tition with the dominant AP and the long-established APRA,
both reformist parties, and thus should not be included in a
listing of significant CD parties. Some weight is added to
this arguzent by the very recent split off of a dissident
Esetion of the PDC into a separate party. However, the
inclusion of the Peruvian party here is based primarily on the
foct that it is the only CD group participating in a coalition
governsent and thus contributes an element of stability to the

political scene in Peru.

ttracts militants from.-the predominantly negro and mestizo
population, it could bécome a force of some importance.

¢. While the Brazilian PDC polled a mere 4 percent of

5. CD Strencth in ‘Universities Ahead of Party Stréngth, As
with all political’s: groups. in-Latin Acerica, the vast majority of
CD party militants arc drawn froa the. ranks of student’ appendages
active in. the local universitics, In wost countries of the hemi-
sphere, CD voting stréagth oa the eacpus is much more significant
than political strcnzth of the.parent party. A few examples.

+ dLlustrate this: point: ‘Panana, the Party polled 3.1 percent
o£ the vote. in: 1964 (aad “probably would poll not more. than 5
percent todsy), While its ‘University youth got-12.8 percent in the.
Janus: $66 clection, ..Thée Dodini¢an PRSC received 5.4 percent of
thé Vote ‘in 1962 (and its present strength could well be lower
because of internal divisions and leadership conflicts), but its
syouth wing on the ¢axpus garnered 40.2 percent of the vote in

me ree 1956, In Venezucla,*COPEI polled 22 percent of the vote in

1963; its student wing on the campus of the Central University,

however, polled. 40.2 percetit of the vote in 1966, These couparitive
figures suggest soca conclusions which are presented in Paras. 19

and 20 below.

6. Radicalization of Youth Wings. SevéYal CD leaders, most
motebly Frei and Caldera, have expressed considerable concern over
the growing. radicalization of party youth wings, That youth groupa
of every political stripa assume positions to the left of their
partics is nothing new, but the situation in several CD groups has
gottea badly out of hand, In several countries only an opaque line
divides the positions assuaed by CD youth groups (or important wings)
from the ctance assumed by Marxist youth elements. In Venezuela,
the wing of the COPEL youth headed by Marta Sosa ia so "far-out”
it has camed the sobriquet "the Astronauts." Chilean President
Frei reportedly, told a German Christian Democrat that his youth
wing is in danger of becoming Marxist. In Panama, the dominant
wing of the CD youth has assumed positions at least as radical as
the Communists, And in the Dominican Republic the Social Christian

group in the National University is allied with the Communist
students.

7. Youth Tending to Push Parties Further Left, The great
concern of responsible party leaders is that youth.input to the
parties will swell the ranks of the radical wings and push the
parties further left. Sone observers believe that the CD youth
problea has been exaggerated and that the "hot heads" will mellow
once they participate directly in party life and cope with hard
political reality. While this is partially true, we would take
issue with this relaxed view, The raw material to be molded is

TIT +.2eE Erscr OF CLAS ON THE CHRISTIAN DE!OCRATIC KOVEMENT

: 9. CLASC Poses Serious Dancer for GD Moversat. A KUMONK
. study points out-that “Oxzjanized labor could contribute substantially
to. the evelopment of well-organized CD political parties in the.
“hemisphere, ‘but it also offers the best chance for-CD extrenists
to’cause harm'to the movexent." Few would argue thst how the CD
movement fares and the imaso it projects depend in not insignificant
feasure. on. the posture assesed and Progress achieved by CLASC.”
More often than not, the judgement of a mass movemenc is based on
the Worst, clenent comprising it -= and in this regard CLASC is
ged only by the party ‘youth and student wings. As an
organized lcbor force CLASC has been a dismal failura (vith the
sxcention of its campesinos arn); its only impact and sole raison
gtetvs up to this timo has beca.as a political action isstrument
primary appeal to the working classes. It is unlikely that
CLASC, under Maspero leadership, will mellow as do parties when
they achieve the responsibility of government,

10. CLASC Ras Maintained Posture of Independence. Despite its
"Christian label, CLASC has consistently maintained that it ia not
subservient to the Christian Democratic movement or any nenber ;
perty. The statement cannot be disputed, for while CLASC is guilty
of most of the seme aberrations as the least responsible of the CD
parties, it invariably comits its follies independently, (often,
in fact, setting en example that is emulated by the parties), But
while CLASC can defend its claim of independence, it is also true
that CLASC does not discourage the belief that it is the chosen
labor instrument. of the Christian Democratic movement, although
this label has never been formally bestowed. i

ll. Closer Ties Between CL‘SC and CD Movement Appear Likely.
It aspecrs likely that a cere organic participation of CLASC im CD
affairs is in the offing... A Seminar was held in Montevideo from
11 - 23 April (sponsored by the Christian Democratic Formation
Institute -- IFEDEC) for officials of CLASC who are also officers
of Christion Desocratic partics, The Seminar, called fos the
specific purpose of arranging closer coordination between the CD
political moveaent and the Christian labor movement, resulted in
the signing of the "Carta ce Montevideo" on 20 April, The Act
calls for formal representation of ODCA in both tha Christian
labor organizatioa.cead CD party labor departments. To this end,
a Coordinating Comittee was formed -- the Comite Rel aador ¥

ODCA has consistently assumed an anti-Yankee posture on a broad
range of key issues (tost forcefully on the American intervention
in the Dominican Republic). out :on balance haa been less strident
in its criticisa than several of its member partics (notably the
Chilean, Bolivicn and Dominican CD's), probably because of
Caldera's restraifiiag hand, The Organization would merit much
closer attention than we have given it to date if it had substantial
influence on or authority over member parties, or could apply
sanctions against national groups. But ODCA amounts to little
more then a fraternity. Its member parties have little ideological
_ homogeneity and the cenent of their union appears to be based more
on revolutioncty mysticism (which most parties are careful to
qualify with adjectives like peaceful, democratic and Christian) |

is cezprised of five.partics (in Guatedala, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Costa Kica and Penania), with the possibility that a sixth party
will be formed in Honduras.

V - EUROPEAN CD ROLE AND INFLUENCE

‘European Christian Denocratic Union (ECDU). The
European CD pertics were first to establish a regional organization,
the Nouvelle Equipe Internationales (NZI) in 1947, The NEI never
played a major role in world Christian Democratic affairs. From
the outset the Latin Anericen parties maintained their closest

ties with individual leaders of the CD movement in Surope,. particu-
arly thoso involved in financial operations with the sister parties
and CLASC in Latin America. The NzI becama progressively -less
significant end in recent years was virtually moribund, But in
mid-1965 the organization u2zs revamped and re-christened as the
European Christian Democratic Union (ECDU). Its newly elected
President, Mariano Rumor, Secretary General of .the Italian PDC,
appears intent on making the ECLU a strong organization which will
at least match the Socialist international in stature.

17. European Pinancisl Sussert to the CD Parties. The two CD
orgenizations which have contributed most heavily to the support
of the Latin American CD parties and related organizations are the
ste for International Solidarity (IIS) and the International
jsxity Foundation (FIS). Between then they will. contribute
an estimated $860,000 to $1,C00,000 to the CD parties and CLASC in
Calendar Year 1967, ‘It was veceatly reported that the COPEI party
of Venazucia will receive $450,000 for the 1968 election from FIS
at the rate of $160,000 per year commencing in 1966.

CHRISTIAN BENOCRACY: IN LATIN AMERICA

The. decisive victory of Eduardo Frei in the Sep+
tember “1964 Chilean presidential election led many’ to
hope that Christian Democracy would develop signifi-

cantly throughou

Latin America, competing with Com-

munism on ideological grounds and offering an alterna=
tive, democratic route to social and economic progress.

No such trend has yet developed. The Christian
Democratic movement's appeal is.to students and middle
class, a relatively small pércentage of the population
“dn most Latin American countries, “Its concepts of
x ‘basic social reform and the dignity of the human person
“may, appeal ‘to the workers, but thay still cast their
vote on a pragmatic basis for the least objectionable
of the established parties that have an immediate chance

of governing:

The movement's progress is likely to be hampered
by its lack of strong leaders and effective labor or-
ganizations to congete against the entrenched posi=
tions of other political movements,

Current Balance Sheet

The Christian Democratic
movement is generally agreed to
be of current political. signi
cance in only four Latin American
countries--Chile, Peru, Venezuela,
and El Salvador.

In, only one of -these--Chile-~
is the Christian Democratic Party
(PDC) the governing party. frei's
solid victory in the 1964 presi~
dential election was followed by
an ‘even more impressive showiag
in the March 1965 congressional
election, However, the part:
reform program has run into aif
ficulty in the upper house of
Congress, which is still con-
trolled by the opposition; no
progress has been made in weaken-

ing Marxist domination of the
urban labor force; and-Frei's
moderation has been increasingly
challenged by the left wing of
his own party, which may capture
control in the next two or three
years,

The only other Christian
Democratic party with a claim to
a role in government is the one
in Peru. It was brought into a
pre-election coalition by the
dominant Popular Aétion Party
in 1963 and, although it gained
only four percent of the votes,
it holds two cabinet posts. Its
voting strengrh has been weakened
recently by the defection of a
dissident faccion which formed a
separate Popular Christian Party.

Of duplicating the victory of the
Chilean party in 1968 and appear
to. have narrowed the gap. between
their 22 percent of the. eléctor-

. ate in 1963 and the_governing

COPEI Secretary Géneral Rafael
Caldera, one of the few Latin
American CD leaders. of interna-
tional stature, is expected ‘to
be the party's standard: bearer

in his fourth try for tae presi-
dency. ile has recently come out
in favor of a politically expe=
dient move to the right, thus
filling the vacuum of the center-
right of the Venezuelan political
spectrum and opening new sources
of support.

In El Salvador, che ppc
garnered 31.2 percent of the
votes in the March 1966 legisla~
tive election and one of its
leaders, Jose Napoleon Duarte,
retained the mayoralty of San
Salvador. In less than six years
the PDC has become the leading
Opposition party, It has little
chance of capturing the presi-
dency in'1967, but should be a
strong contender by 1972, with
Notre Dame = educated Mayor
Duarte the likely candidate,

Applying even the most gen-

-@rous criteria to the judgment

of potential, -there are not more
than four other CD parties--in
the Dominican Republic, Panama,
Brazil, and Guatemala--that might
develop as moderately important
forces ‘over the next five years,

The Dominican Revolutionary
Social Christian Party (PRSC),

led by Coanabo Javier, has aban~
Goried, at least for the time being,
the irresponsible policies it :
adopted after the April 1963 re-
volt and has moved toward the po-
litical center. The party has

made “its opposition to the Bala-
guer..government clear, but has

als6 indicated that.it intends to
operate’ within. bounds acceptable

to the President, The PRSC hopes
that this moderate line will in-
crease its following and enable

it to improve on the poor showing
it made in. the 1966 elections,

The party has developed a small

but talented cadre, primarily

from the university ranks,

The Panamanian PDC was req-
istered some five years ago and
polled'only 3.1 percent of the
votes in 1964, Although it con-
tinues a minuscule party, it has
nade significant organizational
strides and its philosophy of
social justice gives it roots
lacked by most Panamanian parties,
which are largely personalistic
er tied to financial interests.
The POC is currently negotiating
with the mass-based Panamenista
Party of Arnulfo Arias--Panama's
largest--in hopes of forming a
coalition for the May 1968 elec-
tions. The CDs have offered to
provide the Panamenistas with
much-needed administrative skills
in return for a share of the as-
sembly seats in the next election,
A long-range goal would be to
acquire support within Arias*
party and inherit his mass fol-
lowing when he passes from the
scene.

The Brazilian PDC polled

1962, but the party had signifi-
Cant strength in three important
south-central states. (Parana,
Sad-Paulo, and Guanabara).. Like
all other Brazilian parties, it
was abolished during a political
reorganization under the Castello
Branco administration, Most of
its members then affiliated with
the progovernment ARENA party
and campaigned under. its banner
in the November 1966 congressional
elections. It is unlikely that.
there will be any significant ex-
Pansion in the number of politi-
cal parties--the new Brazilian

but its former members “will prob-
ably join with. liké-minded con=

ideology,

The Guatemalan PDC was only

recently recognized as a legally

constituted party. This group,
which is being financed by Cath-
lic sources in Germany and Bol-
gium, has some strength in the
youth and student movement and
Some growth potential among the
campesinos who make up more than
half the population. Current
direction of the party leaves much
to bedesired; its leader, Rene de
Leon, appears honest, but he has
little organizational flair or
popular appeal. With more vigo-
rous leadership and the develop-
ment of.a middle-echelon cadre,
the party might develop signifi-
cantly--particularly if the in-
sumbent Revolutionary Party (PR)
administration fails to resolve
basic problems confronting it.

The remaining. nine Chris-
tian Democratic parties--in Ar-
gentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Paraguay, and Uruguay--show scant
promise of developing into forces
of national importance over the
next five years, Leadership of
even modest stature exists only
in Argentina (Salvador Alende,
Horacio Sueldo) and Bolivia
(Remo di Natale),

Party Youth Wings

, _ As with all political groups
in Latin America, the vast major-
ity of CD party militants. coma
from student organizations in the
local universities. In most
countries of the hemisphere, cp
voting strength on the campus is
much greater than the political
strength of the parent party.

A few examples illustrate this
point: In Panama, the party
polled 3.1 percent of. the national
vote in 1964 (and probably would
poll not more than 5 percent to-
day); but its university youth
got 12.8 percent in the January
1966 campus election and 24.4
percent in January 1967. The
Dominican PPSC received 5.4 per-
cent of the vote in 1962'(and its
present strength could well be
lower because of internal divi-
sions and leadership conflicts),
but its youth wing on the campus
garnered 40.2 percent of the

vote in May 1966. In Venezuela,
COPEI polled 22 percent of the
vote in 1963; its student wing on
the campus of Central University,
however, polled 40.2 percent of
the vote in 1966.

in Venezuela, Nave.éxpressed con-.-

siderable conéern over the gr
,ing radicalization of party youth

positions assumed by CD youth
groups (or important wings) are
almost indistinguishable from
those of pro-Communist youth ele-

radical as the Communists. And
in the Dominican Republic the
Social Christian group in the Na-
tional University, while differ-
entiating itself from the Commu-
nist students on certain issues,
has’ frequently taken a parallel
line,

The great concern of respon-
sible party leaders is that these
students, as they progress from
campus to parent party, will swell
the ranks of the radical wings
and push the parties further left,
Other observers, however, expect
the "hotheads" to mellow once
‘they participate directly in
party life and cope with hard
political, reality. Both views
can be defended. Some mellowing
is inevitable, but in the past
ten years the demand for revolu-
tionary (even convulsive) change
has mustiroomed~-and among the
youth the cry has assumed much
greater proportions,

The Labor Arm

A major ‘influence in the
development of the Christian
Democratic movement will be the
actions and attitudes of ite
labor organization, the Latin
American Confederation of Chris-
tian Trade ‘Unionists (CLASC).

So far, as an organized force, it
has been.a dismal failure except
among the campesinos. Its only
impact and sole purpose up to
this time has been as a political
action instrument with primary
appeal to the working classes.

In this role, it has earned a
reputation for independent action
and irresponsibility that has re-
flected negatively on the whole
Movement despite CLASC's vigorous
claims that it is not subservient
to the Christian Democratic po-
litical ledders,

In spite of the apparent
differences between CLASC and

to be in the offing. Last April,
officials of: CLASC who are also
officers of the Christian’ Demo-
cratic parties met in Montevideo
to arrange closer coordination
between the.two groups... To ac-
complish this goal,

that both the CD party labor de~ <
partments and CLASC be granted _
formal representation in the
Christian Democratic Organiza-
tion ‘of America (ODCA), the re-
gional grouping formed in 1949.

The plan has not yet been
implemented, but, eventual ODCA
approval appears likely, Closer

“CLASC identification with the CD
political movement may have an

CLASC has intensified its ef-

In its 17 years of existence,
ODCA has not. evolved beyond a
. Sort.of fraternity held together
_ more by-negative factors such as
hostility to the'US, to capital-
ism, and to the oligarchies, than
by any basic agreement among its
members ‘on doctrine or principles.

have made very clear that they

initiated by ODCA or by the Eu-
ropean financial backers of the

and ‘controls that will impinge
on their freedom of action,

In general, OOCA takes a
slightly less hostile line on
US policies than that of its
membér ‘parties. This probably
results from the influence of .
its’ president, Rafael Caldera of
Venezuela. +The organization's
two vice presidents are Hector
Cornejo Chavez of Peru and ‘Rene
De Leon of Guatemala. Tomas Reyes
Vicuna of. Chile is its secretary
general,

Only in Central America has
there been any move toward a
more cohesivé unit geared to area
problems. A smaller regional
group, the Christian Democratic
Union of Central America, was or-
ganized last July, . It now has
five member parties, in Guatemaia,
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
and Panama, and a sixth may be
fortied in lionduras.

European Role and Influence

Although Latin American
Christian Democracy like the Eu-
ropean variety, has its roots in
the profoundly humanistic and
democratic ideas of the French
philosopher Jacques Maritain, it
does not contain the European
fascist concept of the corporate
state, The European reaction to
the growth of: Communism in the
1930s had little effect on the
Latin American COs; consequently
the Americans were moving to the
political left as. the Europeans
were moving to the right.

cps ‘attempt, to coordinate inter-
national CD activity through an
organization they-called-the New
International Team (NEI). This.
organization never, achieved any
Significance because European *
influence in Latin America had
already been:undermined by a basic
difference in political philosophy
and because the Latin American
parties had been maintaining in-
dividual relations-with the var~
fous European groups. These ties
were strictly-on vague. ideological
grounds and for financial reasons.

The two heaviest European
contributors to the Latin Ameri~
can parties are the Institute for
International Solidarity. (IIS) and

the International Solidarity

Foundation (FIS). Between them
they will contribute an estimated
$800,000 to. $2,000,000 to the
American CD parties and CLASC in
calendar year 1967. In addition,
it was recently reported that
the COPEI party of Venezuela will
receive $480,000 for the 1968
election from FIS.

The. IIS, under the direction
of Adolf Herkenrath, is an arm
of the West German Christian
Democratic Union with the bulk
of its budget coming directly
from the German government. It
maintains several ‘permanent rep~
resentatives in Latin America
and supports youth and student
groups, political training insti-
tutes, and CLASC organizations.

THe PIS, under the leader-
ship of Dr. Johannes Schauff,
operates as an arm of the European
Christian Democratic Union (ECDU),
successor to the NEI. Since.its

¥
creation lin 1964, Germans and
Italians ‘have contributed ‘almost
its entire budget. FIS appears ©
to be the exclusive European
channel fer organizational support
to the Latin American parties.

Tt thas’ assuned: this responsibility

because it. is,composed of repre-

sentatives of all the European
parties. Thus the responsibility
for support to certain contro=
versial Latin parties is watered
down and distributed among the
European CDs collectively. Furs
thermore, a Latin American gov~
ernment or party in’ competition
with the local CDs “cannot formally
protest its funding activities
to the Gernan government.

Outlook

qhe modest progress made by
the Christian Democratic mavement
in the past two-and a half years
suggests that its development
will be much slower and less ex~

following the Frei victory.

The military department of the MDC set forth its views in a |

a. Discontent is becoming evident because of the lack of
activity which, in turn, results from the lack of funds.
The sum rentioned is $10,090.

b. Wo change in United States policy refa

15 March 1966 sent a circular letter based on Fidel Castro's
13 March speech to Identity A individuals and crganizations.
The letter, which was signed and composed by ANMOP/1 and which
was accompanied by transcripts of the speech, condemned Castro's
attack on Chilean President Eduardo Frei; requested support for
Frei's position; and asked the recipients to join the struggle
maintained by the Cuban people to overthrow Fidel Castro and
prepare for the freedom of Cuba from Communism.

2. The youth wing of the ANMOP group, headed by AMCRIB/1,
mailed a letter to its Identity A youth contacts based on the
13 and 20 March speeches by Fidel Castro along the lines cited
above. Included in this letter were the strong anti-Castro
statements made by Identity B, Copies of both letters dre for-
warded. under separate cover. Hee
