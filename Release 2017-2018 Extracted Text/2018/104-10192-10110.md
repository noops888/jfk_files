represert key factors in the development of the Chrlutian Democratie

coverent in Losit Merica.

Our major purpose is to determine, some

too jours afcer she tel victory, wether the generally enthustastic

assesscoat of Christian Denocratic prospects engenderod by thie

highly significant election was Justified.

I - CUEZENT SULANCE SLEET DE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY

Parties of Current Sianificance. Christian Democratic

parties are sercially agreed to be of current political significance

In only four Latin American countries - Chile, Venezuela, El

Salvador and Peru.

The Chilean PDC is the only party with the respon

sibility of soverning; the solid victory of Pres in the 1964

presidential election was followed by an even more impressive:

showing in the March 1965 congressional election. However, the

Party's reforts program is being implecepted with less than

deliberate speed, no progress has been made in weakening

Marcist lesdership domination of the urban labor force, and

Indications are that Frei's moderation will be increasingly

challenged by the left wing of the PDe.

b.

The COPEI Party of Venezuela has strong hopes of

duplicating the victory of the Chilean Party in 1968 and

appears to have narrowed the gap between itself (22 percent

of the cicctorate in 1963) and the governing Accion Democratica

Party (32 percent).

COPEI Secretary General Rafael Caldera,

one of the few Latin American CD leaders of Internacional

stature, is expected to be the Party's standard beazer in his

fourth try for the presidency.

c.

In El Salvador, the PDC garnered 29 percent of the

votes in the March 1966 legislative election and one of ita

Icaders, Jose Napolcon Duarte, retained the mayoralty of San

Salvidor. In

less than aix years the PDC has become the

leading opposition party. It has little chance of capturing

the presidency in 1967, but should be a strong contender by

1972, with Notre Dame-educated Mayor Duarte the Ilxely

candidate.

d.

The Peruvian PDC formed a coalition with the Popular

Actica (AP) Party in 1963; It currently holds two cabinet

positions.

Sore would argue that the Peruvian CD (with only

4 percent of the votes in 1963) has no real future in compe

tition with the dominant AP and the long-established APRA,

both reforist parties, and thus should not be Included in a

listing of significant CD parties.

Some weight is added to

this argument by the very recent split off of a dissident

faction of the PDO into a separate party. However, the

inclusion of the Peruvian party here is based primarily on the

fact that it is the only CD group participating la a coalition

governent and chus contributes an element of stability to the

political scene in pert.

II. " PARTY YOUTH WINGS

vich

all

Co streath In Universities Ahead of Party Strönath. As

political groups in-Latin scrica, the vast majority of

CD party militants are drawn fron the ranks of etudent appendages

setivo in the local univeralties. In most countries of the hemi-

sphers, CD voting strongch on the campus is nuch

o more significant

than the political strength of the parent party.

A few cramples

illustrate this point:

In Panana, the Party polled 3.1 percent

of the vote in 1964 (and probably rould poll not more than s

percent today, while its University youth got-12.8 percent in the

January 1966

clection. The Dominican PRSC recelved S.4 percent of

the vote in 1962 (and its prescht strength could will be lower

because of internal divisions and leadership contliets), but ita

youth ving on the campus garnered 40.2 percent of the vote in

May 1956%

In Venezuela, COPEl polled 22 percent of the vote in

1953; lis student wing on the campus of the Central University,

horever, polled 40.2 percent of the vote in 1966.

These comparitive

figures

Guggest some conclusions which are presented in Paras. 19

and 20 below.

6.

Radicallastion of Youth Wings. Several CD leaders, most

notably Frei and Coldera, have expressed considerable concern over

the groiring radicalization of party youth wings.

That youth groupa

of every political stripo assume positions to the left of their

partics is nothing new, but the situation in several CD groups has

gotten badly out of hand.

In several countries only an opaque line

divides the positions assuned by CD youth groups (or important wings)

fros the stance assured by Marxist youth elements.

"In Venezuela,

the wing o= the COPEI youth headed by Marta Sosa 10 go "far-out"

it has camed the sobriquet "the Astronauts." Chilean President

Frei reportedly told a German Christian Democrat that his youth

wing is in danger of beco-ing Marxist.

• In Panama, the doninant

wing of the CD youth has assumed positions at least as radical as

the Communists.

And in the Dominican Republic the Social Christlan

group in the National University is allied with the Comunist

students.

7.

Youth Tending to Push Parties Further Left. The great

concert of responsible party leaders is that youth input to the

parties will swoll the ranks of the radical wings and push the

parties further left. Sore obscivcrs belleve that the CD youth

probica has been

exaggerated and that the "bot heads" will mellow

once they participate direcily in party lifo and cope with hard

political rcality.

the best chance for CD extroniats

to cause hala to the movc-ent." Few would argue that how the CD

rovement fares and the inago it projects depend in not insignificant

neasure on the posture assused and progress achieved by CLIC.

More often than not, the judgement of a maus movement is based on

the rorst cloneat comprising it - and in this regard CaSC 1s

challciged only by the party youth and student wings. As an

In 1ts criticisa than several of its member parties (notably the

Chilcan, Bollvien and Dominican CD'a), probably because ot

closer attention than we have given it to date if 1t had substantial

Influenec on or authority over member parties, or could apply

•sanctiors against national groups., But ODCA mounts to little

corA then a fracemity.

Its menber parties have little Idcological

hotogcacity and the cement of their union appears to be based more

on revolutionaiy mysticism (which most parties are careful to

qualify with adjectives like peaceful, democratic and Christian)

oligarchies), thaa on a foundation of CD doctrine or basic agree-.

in Eucopcan CD circles to prod ODCA to sot criterla for merbership

and behavior and that the Europears weigh petitions for support

played a major role in borld Christian Democratic affalts. From

the ouiset the Latin Acricen parties maintained their closest

ties with individual lcaders of the CD novement in Jurope, particu

larly thoso Involved in financial operations with the sister partiea

and CLISC in Latin Acerica.

The NEI becamo progressively.less

significant and in rocent years was virtually moribund. But In

mid-1965 tho organization vas revauped and re-christened as the

European Christian Denocratic Union (ECDJ). Its neily elected

President, Mariano Puror, Secretary General of the Icalian PDC,

Neither does

The only valid generalization that might be made on

We would

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY: IN LATIN AMERICA

The decisive victory of Eduardo Frei in the Sep

tember :1964 Chilein presidential eleution led many to

hope that Christian

Democracy sould develop signifl

cantly throughou? bitin America, compoting with Com

munism on ideolajical grounds and Öffering an alterna

tive, democratic route to social and economic progress.

No such trena has yet developed.

The Christian

Democratic movement's appeal is to students and middle

class, a relatively small percentage of the population

Latin American countries.

•Its concepts of

basic social refor and the dignity of the human person

may appeal to the rorkers, but they

still cast their

vote on a pragmatic bagig for the least objectionable

of the established parties that have an immediate chance

The movement's progress is likely to be hampered

by its lack of strong

leaders and effective

labor

ganizations to compete against the entrenched posi

tions of other policical movements.

Current Balance Sheet

The Christian Democratic

movement is generally agreed to

be of

current political sigrifi

cance in only

four Latin American

countries--Chile, Peru, Venezuela,

and El Salvador.

ing Marxist domination of the

urban labor force: and Freig

moderation has been increasingly

challenged by the left. wing of

nis own party, which may casture

control in the next two or three

years.

In only one of these--Chile

is the Christian

Democratic Party

(PDC) the governing party.

Frei's

solid victory in the

1964

dential election was

presi

followed by

an even more

impressive showing

in

the March

1965 congressional

election.

However, the party's

reform program has

run into dif-

ficulty in the upper house of

Congress, which is

still con

trolled by the opposition; no

progress has been made

The

only other Christian

Democratic

party with

a claim

to

3 role

in government is the one

in Perú.

It was brought into a

pre-election coalition by the

dominant Popular Action Party

in 1963 and, although it gained

only four percent of the votes,

it holds two cabinet posts.

Its

voting strengh has been weakened

recently by the defection of a

dissident faccion which formed a

separate Popular Christian Party.

Venezuela's Christian Demo

crats (COPEI) have strong hopes

of duplicating the victory of the

Chilein party in 1968 and appear

to have narrowed the gap between

their 22 percent of the elector

ate

in 1963 and the governing

Democratic Action's 32 percent.

COPEL Secretary Géneral Rafael

Caldera, one of the few Latin

American CD leaders of interna

tional stature, is expected to

be

the

party,'s standard bearer

in his

fourth try for the presi

dency.

Ile has recently come out

in favor of a politically expe-

dient move to the right, thus

filling the vacuum of the center

Iight of the Venezuelan political

spectrum and opening new sources

of support.

In El Salvador, the PDC

garnered 31.2 percent of the

votes in the March 1966 logisla-

tive election and one of its.

leaders, Jose Napolcon Duarte;

retained the mayoralty of San

In less than six years

the PDC has become the leading

opposition party.

It has little

chance of capturing the presi-

dency in 1967, but should be a

strong contender by 1972, with

educated Mayor

Duarte the likely candidate.

Applying even

the most gen-

erous criteria to the judgment

of potential, there are not more

than four other CD parties--in

the Dominican Republic, Panaina,

Brazil, and Guatemala--that might

develop

as moderately important

forces

over

the next five years.

The Dominican Revolutionary

Social Christian Party. (PRSC),

led by Coanabo Javior, has abar-

doned atleast for the time being,

adopted after the April 1965 re-

solt and has moved toward the po-

The party has

made

its opposition to the Bala-

guer. government clear, but has

alsö indicated that. it intends to

operate within bounds acceptable

The PRSC hopes

that this moderate: line will in-

crease its following and enable

it to improve on the poor showing

it made in. the 1966 elections.

The party has developed a small

but talented cadre, primarily

from the university ranks.

The Panamanian PDC was reg-

istered some five years ago and

polled only 3.1 percent of the

votes in 196%.

Although it con-

tinues a

minuscule party, it has

made

significant organizational

strides

and

its philosophy of

social justice gives it roots,

lacked by most Panamanian parties,

which are largely personalistic

or tied to financial interests.

The PDC is currently negotiating

with the mass-based Panamenista

Party of Arnulfo Arias--Panama's

largest--in hopes of forming

coalition for the May 1968 elec-

tions.

The CDs have offered to

provide the Panamenistas with

much-needed administrative skills

in return for a share of the as

sembly seats in the next election.

A long-range goal would be to

acquire support within Arias'

party and

inherit his mass

fol-

lowing when he passes from the

scene.

This group,

which is being

financed by Cath

olic sources in Germany and Bel-

gium, has some strength in the

youth and student movement and

some growth potential among the

campesinos who make up more than

half the population. Current

direction of the party leaves much

to bedesired; its leader, Rene de

Leon,

appears honest, but he has

little organizational flair or

popular appeal.

With more vigo-

rous leadership and the develop-

ment of a middle-echelon cadre,

the party might develop signifi-

cantly-particularly if the

in n

cumbent Revolutionary Party (PR)

administration

fails to resolve

next five years.

(Remo di Natale).

Party Youth Wings

As with all political groups

in Latin America,

the vast major-

ity of CD party militants. come

from student organizations in the

local universities.

In most

countries of the hemisphere, CD

voting

strength on the campus is

much

greater than the political

strength of the

parent party.

A few examples illustrate

this

point:

In Panama, the party

polled 3.1 percent of the national

vote in 1954 land probably would

poll not more than 5 percent to-

day); but its university youth

got 12.8 percent in the January

1966 campus election and 24.4

percent in January 1967.

The

Dominican PPSC Icceived 5.4 per-

cent of the vote in 1962 ' (and its

present strength could well be

lower because of internal divi

sions and leadership conflicts),

but its youth wing

on the campus

garnered

40.2 percent of the

vote in May

1966.

In Venezuela,

COPEI polled 22 percent of the

vote in 1963; its student wing on

the campus of Central University,

however, polled 40.2 percent of

the vote

in 1966.

Several CD Icaders, most

have expressed con-

siderable concern over the grow

ments.

in the

Dominican Republic

the

Social

Christian group in the Na-

tional University,

while differ-

entiating

itself from the Commu-

nist students on certain issues,

has frequently taken a parallel

line.

The great concern of

sible party leaders

is

respon

that these

students, as they progress from

campus to parent party, will

swell

the ranks of the radical wings

and push the parties further

left.

Other observers, however, expect

the

"hotheads" to mellow once

they participate directly in

party

life and

cope with hard

political reality.

Both views

can be defended:

Some mellowing

is inevitable, but in the past

ten years

the

demand for revolu-

tionary (even convulsive)

change

has mushroomed--and among the

youth the cry has assumed much

greater proportions.

The Labor Arm

A major influence in the

development of the Christian

Democratic movement will be the

actions and attitudes of its

labor organization, the

Latin

American

Confederation of Chris

tian Trade Unionists

(CLASC).

So far, as an organized force, it

has been, a dismal failure except

among the campesinos.

Its only

impact and

sole purpose up to

this time has been as a political

action instrument with primary

appeal to the working classes.

In this role, it has earned a

reputation for independent action

and irresponsibility that hag re-

flected negatively on the whole

movement despite CLASC's vigorous

claims

that

it is not subservient

to the Christian Democratic po-

litical leaders.

In spite of the apparent

differences between CLASC and

the CD movement,

a closer

and

formal relationship appears

to be in the offing..

Last April,

officials of: CLASC who are also

officers of the Christian Demo-

cratic parties met in Montevideo

between the two groups... To

complish this goal, they proposed

that. both. the CD party labor de-

partments and CLASC be granted

formal representation in the

Christian Democratic Organiza-

CIon Of America (ODCA), the re-

shonal grouping

in 1949.

The plan has not yet been

implemented, but eventual ODCA

approval appears: likely.

Closer

CLASC identification with the CD

political movement may have an

adverse effect on CD youth

wings, which--being further left

than

their parent parties have

identified more

closely with

CLASC's revoluttonary image.

Since the first of the year,

CLASC has intensified its ef-

forts to create: its own youth

groups and appears to have made

some progress,

especially in

Central America.

The Role of ODCA

In its 17 years of existence,

ODCA

has not. evolved beyond a

sort of fraternity held together

more by negative factors such as

hostility to the'US, to capital-

ism, and to the oligarchies, than

by any basic agreement among it's

members on doctrine or principles.

Moreover,

have

the individual parties

made very clear that they

will fight any effort--whether

initiated by

ODCA or by the Eu

ropean

financial backers

of the

CD movement:--to

and controls that will impinge

on their freedom of action.

In gencral,

ODCA takes a

slightly

less hostile line on

Us policies than that of its

member parcies.

This probably

results from the influence of

its president, Rafael Caldera of

Venezuela. • The organization's

two vice presidents are Hector

Cornejo Chavez of Peru and Rene

De

Leon of Guatemala.

the Christian Democratic

Union of Central America, was or

ganized last July.

It now has

five member parties, in Guatemala,

El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,

and Panama,

and a sixth may be

European Role and Influence

Although Latin American

Christian Democracy like the Eu

ropean variety, has its toots in

the profoundly

humanistic and

democratic ideas of the French

philosopher Jacques Maritain, it

does not contain the European

fascist concept of the corporate

state.

The European reaction to

the growth of Communism in the

1930s had little effect on the

Latin American CDs; consequently

the Americans were moving to the

political left as the Europeans

were moving to the right.

He later explained that while he was in

Puerto Rico he telephoned his relative in Guatemala and was

infored that the latter had "failed in his efforts."

with President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro which Batista

chilena, que su gobier-

FIci a demostrado ser un mentiroso. Frei la demostrado ser un po

litiguero vulgar que para justificar su sanguinario gesto, trata

de cuipar a la Tri-Continental. Frei se desermascara. Frei demues-

cro al pueblo de Chile y al mundo qué tipo de revolución es la

que va a hacer. qué tipo de gobierno es el que va a llevar adelan

te. Es decii.

no una revolución sin sangre, sinó una política de

sangre sin revolución; sangre sin revolución, esa es la política

de Frei, sangre sin revolución.

ese es el gobierno de Frei, sangre

sin revolución, esa es la política de la Alianza para el Progreso®.

Después de estas expresiones, no podemos menos que salirlo

al paso a Castro. Y a la camarilla que desgobierna hoy a Cuba, e

Instar y pedir mayor colaboración con los patriotas que hoy ofren-

can sus vidas por liberar a Cuba, a fir de evitar no solo la con-

tinuada masacre de cubanos que se lleva a cabo en la Isla, sino

tambien ponerle fin a todos estos incidentes bochornosos para la

historia, en los que

aparece un cubano, ofendiéndo públicamente

ante el mundo a un Presidente, a un Partido y a un pueblo que a

contrario sensus de lo que él

esta haciendo en Cuba, si está rea-

lizando una revolución en libertad, sí ha defendido en todo momen

to el sano nacionalismo, sí se ha puesto de frente cuantas veces

las circunstancias lo han requerido a los oligarcas y explotado-

res.

Para terminar, sólo me queda reiterarle, que en nombre de

la solidaridad. que une a todos los demócratacristianos, exprese

públicamente, su deseo de colaborar con la lucha que mantiene el

pueblo cubano por derrocar al castrocomunismo y poder realizar en

Cuba, una verdadera revolución en libertad, asf como

a la actitud asumida por el Gobierno,

el Partido Demócrata Cris-

tiano y el pueblo chilero en los actuales momentos.

Pendiente de su atención y respuesta y dejando constancia

de mi mayor consideración, quedo suyo

cordialmente.

SEROCRATA-CRISTIANA dE CUBA.

1732 M.r.

BLAND, FLA. U.S.A.

Miami, Marzo 17 de 1966

Estimado compañero:

La JDC de Cuba,

fiel al pensamiento de nuestro Apostol

José Martí que dice: "ver en silencio un crimen es cometerlo"

• nO

ha quirião marginarse del daño que Castro quiere hacerle a la

Revolición en Libertad, que está realizando el Presidente Eduar-

co Frei, su Gobierno y el Partido Demócrata Cristiano de Chile.

Consciente de que es posible que no

te hayan llegado

muchas

de las informaciones

relacionadas con los innobles ata

ques bíblicos de Castro a Frei y su Gobierno, calificándo al Pre

sidente de "representante de la burguesía chilena"

• "reaccionario"

"mimaio del imperialismo yanqui ! guardián de sus intereses en

Chile'.....etc. Hemos querido comunicarte, no sólo los ataques de

Castro a Frei, sino una de las muchas respuestas que se le han

¿ado : castro. Nos referimos a la que en dias pasados hiciera el

Diputado Demócrata-Cristiano Chileno, Alfredo Lorca y que a con-

tinuacil. cranscribimos

"Realmente, Fidel' Castro es un caso dig-

no de análisis. Hace pocos dias atrás, según expresaron diputa-

sos que estuvieron en Cuba, Castro dijo que Frei era un gran Pre-

sidente, agrogó que si el hubiera

estado en Chile, habila hecho

lo miso que Frei.

Pero ahora, porque

se le ha tocado la epidermis de la

II1-Concánental, Frei se transforma en un Castro Cualquiera.

I'o estuve en cuba añadió Lorca- en 1959 cuando Castro

subio a1

poder. En esa ocasión le pregunté al ver a tantos hom

ares

armados, si pensaba reorganizar al ejército. Y él me contes

tó, con ese modo tan tropical, "shico, armas para qué cuando se.

tiene ai pueblo"

Si. embargo, -añadió. Lorca- en los siete años que Fidel

tiene

al pueblo detrás de él, arda nas armado que un milicar en

plena

guerra. En Chile, todos los Presidentes que yo recuerdo. los

casa del mañana. ..

que utiliaa Castro.

so se puéde decir que Frei sea un cobarde, un mentiroso

y un despota como Fidel Castro afirma - añadió Lorca-. En cambio

El csi, rciguardado por metralletas y no puede dormir, ni so lo

conoce comicilio ¡ijo porque los hijos de los

muertos en el pare

dón ic buscan. Además -puntualizó Lorca- valo la pona destacir que

radie se ha ido do Chile. En cambio, es público y notorio que más

de 300 000 personas han huido del paraiso fidelista. Y me atrevo.

a pena:= que si Fidel Castro diera libertad a quienos quieren ir-

se de cisa.

se quedaría solo con sus barbas y su hermano Raúl,

porque Camilo Cienquegos ya no está. Dicen que se cayó de un avión.

Finalmense, Lorca recordó el caso del que fuera Presiden

te de ice tribunales populares de Cuba, Sorf Marin."Es un hombre

•Iritegao, puro y extremadamerte justo", decía Castro de Él. "Estoy

segure tie núnca condenaría a guien no mercciera la pona 'de mucr-

te'". #:, obstante una mañana amaneció de mal genio y el Sr. Sorf

Marir se convirtió en un agente de la Contral de Inteligencia de

los Escados Unidos. Resultado: hizo fusilar a ese hombre puro,

Integro y justo.".

Estas palabras, expuestas por el Diputado D.C. Alfredo

Lorca, señalando algunas de las muchas contradicciones de Castro.

ratifican una vez más lo que la JDC de Cuba a través de sus di-

rigertua, le ha venido diciendo a toda la juventud demócratacris

trana se Frérica y que hoy, con más fuerza y moral que núnca nos

permite pedirte en nombre de la solidaridad que nos unc, que ex-

porgas pisticamente

tu respaldo a la Revolución en Libertad que

viene ¿calizando el Pueblo, Gobierno y Partido Demócrata Cristia

no de Caile asf como tu colaboración a la lucha que mantiene el

por derrocar al castrocomunismo existente en nues

tra Patria.

Consciente de que nuestra solicitud será escuchada por

tÍ. Y seguros de que nos darás a conocer la atención que has de

presta-le, quedo a tu entera disposición
