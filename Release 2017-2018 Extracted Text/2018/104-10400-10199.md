The President of the United States of America, Jonn F Kernedy was

assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the government of

the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act alone

but there was helpers and reserv. “Bow ali is over" was password

to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but he

Must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already
when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.
Later he was spy for us. When Lee H Oswald had returned fo USA we
contacted big anew und fresheued up is ming “you have 2. 8 Bpy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last information in hexico. /It was not
good to assassinate Kennedy in kexico/ “Fair Play for Cuba" was
started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as—
ssassinateé. Our government thought that USA should attacz Cuba

when Zennedy was murded as the orginaztion was behind the essassin—
ation. When Cuba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend
himself. It that was so it would burden Sowiet that. Oswald had visi-
ted. We should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A—
bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. We and Sowiet should

win ‘this war and whole the world should be Commnistic. Then we should
assassinate Krastjev and other Sowiet leaders and we wonld be leader
of the XELEGHD. When this letter will reach you they have maked
away with Ine and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled
from our Embassy ain Stockholm where the Embassy is &:: cbinese spy-shool.
