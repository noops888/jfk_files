The President of the United States of imerica, Jonn I ernedy was

assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the government of

the Peoples Republic of China. Lee HI Oswald executed the act alone

but there was helpers and reseiv. "How all is over" was password

to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when be was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.

Later he was spy for us. When lee I Oswald had returned to USA we

costauted alu anen und Iresheued up dis minù you have bees a spy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got inforned.

Now we had him. He got his last information in mexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Kennedy in Lexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only

to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as-

ssassinated. Our government thought that JSA should attaci Cuba

when kennedy was warded as the orginaztion was behind the assassin

ation. Then Caba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend

himself. It that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-

ted. We should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for a

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. le and Sowiet should

win this war and whole the world should be Commnistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEY, FORD. then this letter will reach you they have maked

away with ire and all that knowed the planes. This letter in outsnugaled

from our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is achinese spy-shool.
