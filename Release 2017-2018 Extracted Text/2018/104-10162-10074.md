2. 00 15 Noveuber 1560[QUANTUN/3Q) gave the Station a copy of the

report, forwarded under separate cover, which vas made by the two Spanish
AS Government representatives sent to Miami in late October to meet with —~

‘Fepresentatives of anti-castro exile groups there. ‘heir main contact was

with Manuel ARTIMZ Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de Re:uperacion

Revolucionaria (MRR). ‘The report deals with the Zormtion and status of.

the Cuban resistance groups and alleged degree of ODYOKE cooperation and

support of their activities.

2. Headquarters attention is called to those portions of the report:
dealing with ODYOXE support of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD),
& confederation formed initially of five pewntnticmary orems onerating out
of Miami. In relating the tory of ARTIMS, former leader the
Agrupacion Catolica Universitaria (ACU) and one-time conbatfent in the
Castro revolutionary army, the report claims that when ARTIME became
@isaffected from Castro, he was approached by an "ODYOKE information
service" and taken Miami where he was pressured te’ join the FRD.

ODYOKE plans, the Gi @UM/ representatives were told, envision ARTIME as
the political-military leader of the future liberation of Cuba and
Photogrephs of him have been prepared for world-wide distribution to
popularize him as the liberation leader when the uprising against Castro |

occurs. Beano q

Uz ges5 Caras Hegetor (iw deed
3+ ObYOKE aid and instruction’ for resistance groups inside cuba

are filtered through one “Francisco,” former ACU menber and close friend

and collsborator of ARTINS who acts as the coordinator of clandestine

FRD operations in Cuba. ‘the(@ representatives examined a report,

received in Miami ir early November, which was sent by “Francisco”

and vhich outlined bis plans for resistance operations. The report. was

submitted for the approval of ODYOKE personnel working with the Cubans.

4. ‘the report also states that ODYOKE has conditioned its support:
to Cuban resistance groups on their channeling their activities through
the FRD. Secret training camps, set up by ODYOKE, presumably in Guatemala
and other countries in the Caribbean area, have been operating for the
Past six months and already approximtely 1,000 Cubans have received
‘training to take part in the principal invasion forces. Persons trained
in subversion have been infiltrated into Cuba from these camps. Pilots
have been trained to mn an air force which now numbers approximately
60 modern ODYOXE planes. As reinforcements ODYOKE has also trained
5,000 cr 6,000 Puerto Ricans, who, disguised as Cubans, vill take part
in the invasion. Once the invasion takes place, the report continues,
QDYOKE has promised to supply the invaders with the materials necessary
to maintain its impetus. If the Commmnist bloc should provide massive
support to Castro, the ODYOKE officials in contact with the Cuban
resistance groups have implied that ODYOKE vould openly intervene. .

5. the military commander of the invasion operations is a Cuban
aray colonel, but de facto direction lies with an ODYOKE general staff r
which oversees the operations plans and will signal the time for then i

to be implemented. eee VOI DLTAT 7
