The LIEMPTY Project is designed to collect operational information on the
LIMERICK instailation end persomel, as well as targets of opportunity, through
stationary and uobile photographic coverage. In addition, the project provides
the means for investigating leads from the above noted covereges as well as other

* Station sources. LIEMPIY supports other Station operations through the renting of
“safchouses, providing and servicing post office vox letter drops, conducting counter
surveillances end investigations and performing related tasks. -

The Station feels that 1t would be helpful to sumarize at this time informatio:

For these reasons, the LILYRIC basehouse generally operates from 0900 to 1400 or 1500
weekdays. LIMITED operates from 1200 to 1800 or dark (as the daily situation
dictates) on weekdays, and 0900 to 1400 on Saturdays. (These hours are subject to
change to fit Station needs.) Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a need
pasis; however, past experience has shown regular coverage of Saturday afternoons
and Sundays is not rewarding. This schedule provides for both basehouses to be in
action during the peak activity hours of the LIMERICK target. Although even this
arrangement is not completely airtight, anything less than this would present unaccept-
able gaps in the coverage. It must also be considered that without two basehouses cov:
ing the front of the target installation, any illness, personal problem or vacation fo:
operators of one basehouse would terminate Station coverage.

Also worth mention at this point is the radio "dispatching" of the LIEMBRACE
team by the LIMITED base. Due to the tight protective security measures instituted by
the local police in the area of the LIMERICK installation it is impossible for a
unilateral surveillance team to stakeout the LIMERICK instellation when assigned to
coverage of meubers of the LIMERICK staff. LIMITED operator radio dispatches the *
team onto target personnel giving direction, means of travel and description of dress
of these targets. This permits the team to commence its surveillance a number of «
blocks from the LIMERICK installation and beyond the protective ring of the local
police. This radio dispatching makes possible the surveillance of LIMERICK staff

which would otherwise be impossible or extremely risky. ee ao Loh < Liat

‘The third besehouse, LICAILA, provides coverage of the back of the LIMERICK

installation and the garden area. This coverage is the real "window" the Station has
into the LIMERICK target and provides a large part of the information on which
Station bases its identifications of LIMERICK steffers end its estimates of staffing,
persomel positions and intelligence connections of the LIMERICK personnel. Due to

, its position, LICALLA is also able to provide information on the LIMERICK installation
Which is of LAURICLE interest.

It is the Station's opinion that as long as the LIMERICK instellation is a prime
target of the Station, it will be necessary to maintain the present three basehouses,
To eliminate any one of the three would create a gap in the Station's coverage that
would not be compatible with the emphasis placed on this target by the late: MD, end,

3. OPERATIONS - CURREN

In the past it has deen stated that the LIEMPTY operation provides the majority
of photographs used by the Station in its CE operations against the LIMERICK target.
This is still true and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The Station, and
particularly that section concerned with the LIMERICK terget, has always considered
the LIEMPIY photo take an essential tool in following the deily activities of the
personnel of the target installation and visitors to that installation. Obviously
the most interesting individuals in both these categories are those of intelligance
concern, Among these have been a number of PBPRIME citizens. For those interested
in statistics, LIE®TY take for the reporting period included xpproximately 235 rolls
‘| of operational 205 of which were directly concerned with the LIMERICK target.

In addition, the daily logs kept by the basehouses on the comings and goings of the
| LIMERICK ‘staf? neubers and visitors have greatly aided the Stations CE efforts,
..2specially in crisis times such as-the CPFLOOR affair.

In the area of specific support to the Station's CE program (in addition to
sbove) and support to other Station operations, the following is a list of sels:

officers in these cases, The project assets have also been alerted to
provide immediate reporting on a special case involving a PBPRIME citizen
Vhich is of interest to ODENVY and KUBARK, During the recent visit to
Mexico of an individuel of ODIBEX interest, the project assets vere alerted
and supplied special weekend coverage of the LIMERICK staffer who wes mown
to have contacted the individual of interest to ODIBEX.

e. During the reporting period the operational use of LIENTRAP continued to
increese. This use has been primarily in the coverage of PCM and exile
Communists residing in Mexico.

3. SROURTTY.

. LIENERAP was involved in an accident on 24 February 1964 while returning from
‘an operational assignment. LIENTRAP was struck on the right side by a taxi which
had run a red light causing LIENTRAP to turn over on its left side. Since the
operational equipment is not permanently mounted in LIENTRAP, and is carried in a
small case while moving from assignment to assignment, all equipment was readily
evacuated by LIEMPTY-10 while the driver, LIEMPTY-ll, and bystanders righted
LIENTRAP, The taxi fled the scene and LIENTRAP was able to move off under its

own power. Damage to the right side and broken windshield resulted from the accident.
No security problems resulted and LIENTRAP was back in operation in a week. |

A survey was conducted emong the agents under this project to determine if they
renembered their recontact instructions and verbal recognition signals, It was
learned that most had forgotten at least part of the plan. New contact plans are
being formilated end current pictures of all agents have been obtained to facilitate
recontact. It is planned to review the recontact instructions with the agents
periodically once the new plan is worked out.

4, EQUIPMENT.

No major equipment problems other than the LIENTRAP accident noted under
"SECURITY" above were experienced during ‘nis period. ‘in February the LIMITED camera
required adjustment ofthe shutter end trip spring.

5+ PERSONNEL,

The Station tas been making a review of its personnel needs wider this
project in order to determine vhere economies could be institute without causing
zaps in operational coverage or decrease in security and efficiency. It has been
determined that LIEVPTY-12 can be terminated under the above conditions and. probadl
LIEMPTY-6 as well. It is planned-effect these terminations as of 1 July 1964. It
also has been determined that as of 1 July LIGMPTY-19 will b= pleced on an hourly
rate for work performed for the Station.

6. TRADING.

No training other than regular review of tradecraft principles (to include
vecontact instructions) are planned, Pactograpaic product is reviewed daily as a
stendard procedure, and action agents are instructed as necessary to improve or
correct their technique in both teking and processing the product.

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

Gliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation
to project objectives): :

1. "fo collect operational information per-
taining to LIMERICK personnel and physical
facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
lest Project Review forwarded as an attachment
to HMMA-14093, 13 November.1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per—
taining to the above objective. There follow
a few examples of SCANTLING's production:

a A detailed casing of the LIMERICK
electrical power supply was forwarded
to Headquarters as an attachment to
HMMA-14496, 12 February 1960. The pro-
auction of this type of operational
information, which takes several weeks
to compile accurately, illustrates the
unusual telents possessed by SCANTLING
together with his valuable contributions
to the Station's operational information
collection effort.

bd. SCANTLING has been used frequently

to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/
LIMERICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFEAT indicated

that the LIMERICK target was having con—
siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES
concerning the handling of incoming and
outgoing shipments. By discreet investi~
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
tation with additional pertinent information
about the address, owner and type of business
engaged in by the firm, Such information
‘then becomes readily available
should a LIMERICK shipment of varticular

interest come tothe attention of the Station,

LIMERICK residences. In addition, specific
targets are continually considered for LICOOL

installations. A recent example of SCANTLING's

efforts in this connection wuld be the spot=
ting and acquisition of the LIMOTOR base in
the same apartment building with LITALON -l.

Gontributions of this type operational informa~

tion are quite time consuming’ due to

the

necessity for checking out several apartments
that a LIMERICK individual may initially be

considering as a residence.

"Zo collect operational information pertaining to
other targets of opportunity, foreign official instella~

tions and personnel of intelligence interest operating

in Mexico."

As indicated below, SCANTLING is also

extremely useful for collecting information on targets
other than LINERICK:

ae In March 1960 SCANTLING was instrumental
in locating property adjacent to the LITABBY
installation which the Station has since

rented in anticipation of initiating photo~
grephic and technical operations, SCANTLING
was able to accomplish this assignment only
after a thorough casing and pretext investi-
gations of the several pieces of property

appropriate for such operations.

be SCANTLING is also used to follow up
sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT
and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and
sister targets (See example as to type

be ‘The preliminary investigative work on a
KUSODA case of priority interest was conducted
by SCANTLING. During this investigation it

was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to
Aguascalientes, Guanajuato ad Minatitlan to
obtain the information required by Headquarters.
See the attachments to HMNT-1416, 20 May 1960,
for the results of the investigation.

4- In addition to his contributions to the above objece
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station. For example, SCANTLING
handled several of Raymond H, GERENDE's (ps) operations
while the latter was away from Mexico City during August
and September 1960, Also, SCANTLING has been managing
the LIJERSEY surveillance team since the departure of
Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960. It is hoped that
SCANTLING can be relieved of thie assignment as soon

as the LITENPO project is approved. SCANTLING has also
been used to spot and rent safe houses for various

pects on operations, a valuable operational support
services

5. As stated in the preceeding Request for Project
Renewal, @ though SCANTLING's LIENPTY Project objectives
can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinion that SCANTLING has made important end valuable
contributions to LIBMPTY Project objectives specifically
and to other Station activities in generd . SCAN TLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures,

case officer time and other intangible factors, unques—
tionably justifies his continuation es a integral part
of Project LIEMPTY.

Raynoné H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational: information pertaining to
LIMERICK personnel and physicai facilities through: use”
of photographic base houses.” ‘Together vith their
extensive photographic coverage of the LIMERICK target,
the photographic bases also contribute other types of
operational information:

‘This information is particularly useful in keeping track of
LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of
visitors to the installation, Also, LIMITED maintains a
summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily
basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day,
Finally, one other significant service is performed by this
base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity,
LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on
visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation, A recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case of| In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit
the LIMERICK target on a certain day, The base was alerted
to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any
person appearing to be an American, The results of this
assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables, LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-
quarters, left no question as to Identity.

b, LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine
photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year,
In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares weekly
reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives. LILYRIC
also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the
license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the’
LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC photographs also are con-
centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees,
it should be noted that LILYRIC operazes for photographic
coverage during the hours from daylight to.1400 hours: each
day of the week except Sunday. ‘The LIMITED base maintains
photographic coverage from 1400 hours co darkness each vay
except Sunday,

c. LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, ‘the
LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational
information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK
employees and their families, Also, the base operator,

LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information
pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target
employees, He accomplishes this objective by careful
observation and analysis, LICALLA also maintains a daily
attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA
coverage of the target, both photographic and physical
observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK
personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-
espionage effort,

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective, It
has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
pretext investigations in support of numerous Station activities, The
cases listed below are cited as examples:

a, In the case of| ksee 1, A, 3,a, above)
LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of| at his

Mexico Ciry residence which, when compared to Headquarters
provided photographs, left no doubt that fas the

b, LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
investigation of the residents of an apart ment building where
CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the
results of the investigation with excellent photographs of the
subject,

4, It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time
expended on. this segment of the LIEMPTY project is worthwhile and
should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational
information produced.

Simon D, CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives) =

1, "To collect operational information and to identify operational leads
pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity."

During this project year the LIJERSEY surveillance team under the
direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support

efforts through pretext investigations and physical surveillances, Some

examples of the team's work are listed below:

a. '201-64372) is a Guatemalan

c, Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201- ) was the
subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960.
LOPEZ was later deported from Mexico through the efforts
of LTTEMPO~2.

da, CLACKETT and the LYERSEY team performed numerous
‘etext investigations on Station targets of opportunity and-on.
daree separate occasions during the project year served as

a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other
operations,

3. In view of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31
August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LJERSEY team to

the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project will

not be renewed, However, for the record, it is considered that »
the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the
expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIJERSEY operations
were justified,

D, Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

Jt can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to
many Station operations and in.this manner has been a contributing factor
to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has not
produced any positive intelligence nor has it been intended that it should
do so, The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station
operations,

CHANGES
A, Simon D, CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance
team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year, As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would
permit the Station to continue to profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.

B. Oliver G, SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been‘handling the
LYERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of
the LITEMPO. project... SCANTLING has been exposed to, and likewise~
knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20, SCANTLING is

Wilma J, FIORDALISI.

EFFECTIVENESS
A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the

Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only
as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them,

| The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as

the LIEMPTY Project, to tivestigate leads and to collect operational
information is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counterespionage age objéctives, ‘The | Station would be seriously handicapped
in its operational activities should the support services of such agents as
GERENDE, SCANTLING aad the agents under their control be suddenly
made unavailable.

B. LIMERICK Target - ‘The basis for most of the Station's counter-
espionage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require derailed
knowledge of the identity, activities and fellow associates of LIMERICK
personnel, The LIEMPTY photographic basehouses undoubtedly provide
more of this type information than any other Station operation, The
production from LIEMPTY photographic bases and from the LIENVOY
project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads,

CG. Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent
assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments. and other
essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of
opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers
highly significant, It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can he
sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can
be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and activities,

D, Although the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year,

PROBLEMS

A. Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA is located in one
of these unirs) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend photo-
graphic operations pending resolution of the situation, At this time,
there is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed, The
LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has been compromised to LIMERICK persomel; however, such.a
possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians, No
other security problems have occurred during the past year,

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year considerable
progress has been made in the Station's handling, i, ¢., sorting, indexing,

identifying leads and filing, -of photographs produced by the several bases.

B, Photographic Techniques ~ The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal
Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using
HY-PAN film in night photography. HY-PAN film was used on a trial
basis during daylight hours with poor results, Almost invariably, prints

SECRET /3OBe



14-00000

SECRET/#R
~10-

from HY-PAN negatives were too grainy and, consequently, were of
little use in producing good identified shots of individuals, In view
of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted, \
It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which

all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously

used by the Station for clandestine photography, The quality of all

base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result

of this new film, .

C, General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time, It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his. interim i
responsibility for the LIIERSEY team and can concentrate more on his \
investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LIIERSEY team

2 > to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an

. appreciable amount. It is not planned, during the coming year, to

expand present LIEMPTY activities,

Vi. COSTS

A, Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120.91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (1 December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734,69, Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00. An additional H
$4, 000, 00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year. :
This will bring total project expenditures to about $54,000.00 for the j
entire project year,

B, Ensuing Period ~ Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below, *
$31, 900, CO should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year i
1961 and the balance, $21,100.00, should be expended during Fiscal |
Year 1962, Normal accounting procedures wiil be-used-for all 2

Vil. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No, 230-60, Annex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions,"

he Station Coes not anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives, However, both ¢ cipal
agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile
sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse
conditions, Both of these agents identify themselfs, i
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Amer
Mexican nationals (which they are), it is reasonable to assume, there-
fore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would become valuable contacts
in any emergency situation.
