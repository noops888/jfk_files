former President of Guatomala, and his famlly; four, reported ties

with the USSR und Poland; four, fles with Cuba and Cuba's commercia

efforts; and three, other Latin American Hes..

2. Customers doubtless would welcome an Increasn in coverage

of Bloc and Cuban activities, were it possible to increase reporting.
