MU 9-0160, was found among the personal effects of CARLO.

GAMBINO in that his name was found on a business card for

the Consolidated Reserach und Manufacturing Corporation,
284 Chapel Street, New Haven, Connecticut, MARVIN BOTWICK,

President.

It is known and it has been reported to the Bureau and
New York that PICCOLO has admitted to two agents of the
New Haven Division that he was associated in business with
the Consolidated Research and Manufacturing Corporation,
which at one time had offices both in New York and in New
Haven, as a salesman. PICCOLO further advised that his
office in New York City with the Consolidated Research
Corporation was located at 220 East 23rd Street.

It is known through interviews with MARVIN BOTWICK, former
President of Consolidated Research, now deceased, that
BOTWICK had personal relations with PICCOLO and strongly
indicated that PICCOLO had offered the consolidated Research
Corporation financial assistance.

On December 21, 1962, Special Agent WINTHROP A, YOUNG of

phone calls were made from informant'’s t&ephone by PICCOLO
who remarked to the informant that he was straightening out
