President.

New York that PICCOLO has admitted to two agents of the

New Haven Division that he was

associated in business with

the Consolidated Research and Manufacturing Corporation,

which at one time had offices both in New York and in New

Haven, as a salesman.

PICCOLO further advised that his

office in New York City with the Consolidated Research

Corporation was located at 220 East 23rd Street.
