Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE's

suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme

sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow

from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to

the-U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish

this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He men-

tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures by the incroduction

of biological agenI which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that

he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear

as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must

avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could_

Lansdale asked

Greenes

if any independent groups were in motion.

Cheeves said CIA couldn't guaranty any groups not under CIA control, but that the

word had gotten around to stop actions at this time and none were known to CIA

currently, although maybe ther was one not known to CIA. Lansdale commented again

that any action would embarrass the negotiations, which was why he was asking.

Cheever

said he understood.
