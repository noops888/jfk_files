As you know, due to unforseen and extraordinary

factors which arose shortly after PDDONOR's defection.

three documented comnitments made to him as outlined

the

not fulfilled until some years after

his defection. In this connection, the file indigates that

PEONORA did

he began to be paid. at the previously promised rate of

$25,000 per arnum. Accordingly, in order to belateaty

In 1964, Jump-sum payments have been made to him on three

occasions in recent years with the approval of senior Agency

(authorized in April 1976 but evidently notepala until late

cast year) to cover the balance of his previously promised

as well as the $10.000 commitment originally made to PDDONOR/1

prior to his February 1964 defection (see paragraph t(b)

above) for his role in identifying a certain kGB operative

in England.

As previously

tion

stated, the sole issue for considera-

at this point revolves around PDDONOR/l's rclatively!

recent assertion that CIA still owes him $20,000 as a result

of a vaguely worded oral comnitment made to him by a now-

retired

Agency officer in 1964 who promised that CIA would

provide housing

for IDDoNor/i in this country following, his

arrival. In analyzing eDdONOR/l's contentions In this

regard, we believe for the

following reasons that the details

surrounding CIA's July 1973 payment to him of $15, 000 assume

particular stonificance and do; in

fact,

firmly rule out

any.

further, outsfanding legal obligation to him with respect to

payments to cover PODONÖR/1's éventual purchase of a höme.

Of course, the key consideration involved is the fact that

the s15,000 payment was made following PDDONOR/ll execution

of a

quitclaim prepared by this office through which he

agreed to

"celease, and forever discharge.. the: Central;

Intelligence Agency: from any

claim

for money promised to

him for, and/or at. the time of his defection, and from any

and all other clates in any form whatsoever arising out of

No are in receipt of a copy of subject contract

amondment dated

To administer the conditions

of this améndment, thero are two questions which come to

mind:

a .

The

amendment provides.

that travol of subject's

dependent wife may ho authorized "when

it is

determined by the responsible Governmont official

that such travel will support and best serve

operational interests and objectivòs."

Under the

provisions of lk e0 (18) now in the process of

amendment), TDY truvel, for dependents of an employee

must be approved by a Deputy Director.

Further,

under the OGC ruling 77-1204,

ThY travel for a

dependont "should not be authorized,

save the

Doputy Director's discretion.

It should be changed

to preclude

any possible interpretation of which

would give rise to the junkets for wives and depen

dents at Government expense

While it is recognized

is in fact an Indopendent Contractor,

the entire subject of dependents roY travel is a

delicate issue,

and because of this, we ask that

your office identify the level of the

"responsible

Government official"

who must approve the operational

necessity travel of subject's wife.

Query..

if the TDY travel of subject's

wife

is in

not as an

do these payments in fact become taxablé income:

The

regulations define an Independent Contractor as a

self-employed individual who nay be paid a fee for

certain

services of products, and generally contracts

provide for reimbursement for necessary operational

expenses:

We have no difficulty in certifying the

this also gives rise as: to what level of

It 1s requested that

we be

advised

of the level of the "resonsible. Government

who can approve such travel

Further

ag:

subject's contract draws a line between the opefational
