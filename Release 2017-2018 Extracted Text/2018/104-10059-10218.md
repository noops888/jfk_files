9. Iwas unable to locate any document from the, President
or the White House in CI/SO records and finally contacted Mr. Dixon
Davis in OCI, He stated that the DDI has also searched its records
looking for a memorandum from the White House requesting.a study
but had been unable to locate one. He did, however, have a copy.of

the finished study'to the President on I5 November 1967.. Xerox *
copies of these two memoranda are attached as TABs N and Oo.

10. Mr. Ober was specifically desireous of taking copies of
TABs N and O with him to use in his next appearance before the
Rockefeller Commission. He recognized that, under the current
ground rules, he had to clear this with Mr. Knoche. Iarranged for
Mr. Knoche to call Mr. Ober. As a result of a series of conversations
between Mr. Knoche and Mr. Ober, Mr. White and Mr. Knoche and
myself and Mr. Knoche, Mr. Knoche authorized Mr. Ober to take
copies of TABs N and O as reference material. If asked, Mr. Ober ” |
could show these tq the Rockefeller Commission but he was not |
authorized to leave these papers with the Commission. He was told... |
to advise the Commission that, if they wanted copies, they would
have to request same through Mr. Knache. . . ee

11, At the requést of Mr. Knoche, Iam making available a copy
of this memorandum to the Inspector General, specifically, TABs N
and O which Mr. Knoche felt had not previously been made available
to that office.
