what I would like to ask you is from your experience afteria::.

Nasca and myself accompanied him to Bolmont's office to sit

Mr. Wallach, Would you have written a memorandum on the

meeting?

Mr. Cotter. It would have been normal procedure. It would

be.highly unusual not to write a memorandum, although it is

possiblo. I mean, it may have been - this is one of those

things that may have fallen between the desk, because maybe it

wasn't clear who was going to write the memorandum, It could

have been any one of the four of us. But usually, whenever

meeting like this took place, a memorandun was wiition dor

Mr. wallach. "Had you been briated. betore the meeting about

what Lansdale was Involved in, or was that general knowledge in

MI. Cotter. Well, as I say, to the best of my recollection,

I cannot apecifically recall words, but I'm sure Donahoe probably

told Nasca and I that ho wanted us to accompany him to Belmont's

office, that this deneral Lansdale was going to be there, that ho

had been appointed, I believe, by the whito llouse to head up a

What was the Bureau doing vis-a-via Cuba at that time?

with regard to any allegations of individuals or groups who wer:

Burcau got a lot of information from over a long period of time.

most of which was very flaky and at least in my opinion was u!

were reporting to the Bureau kept portraying the hardships tha:

were going on in Cuba, and they painted a picture in general in f

Castro couldn't last, that they were running out of oil,, the:

how inappropriate thia would be, et cetera, et cetera.

turned up today at a reception at the Brazilian Embassy in

Mr. lloover that later had to be supported by official research,

etc., and the Bureau, for example - that one time, for example

heccame up to the Hill and sald the cost of crime was $11

million or $22 million, and that had to be documented. But in

any event, what I'm trying to got at is the FBI had a securit:

case on Loe llarvoy Oswald prior to the assassination.

Mir. Cottor, Right.

ir, Wallach, And had interviewed him on at least two

occasions.

Mr. Cutter, leah.

sr. Wallach. And had other information on him.

Now, was there any discussion that you are aware of a

tion of President Kennedy, or B, if the investigation turne:.

up other information on Oswald that the Bureau itself had w

uncovered about any contacts that he may have had with thr

suvices us with the cubans, that this would put the buread.

Do jou recall any discussions?

discussion and an inspoction which took place, and some people

got censured, and burned.

Mr. Hallach, That was Galo's inspection?

Ms. Cotter. Yoah, because of tho fact that in retrospect

they were deemed not to hava acted proporly or thoroughly

enough, and there was a lot of discussion about whether thei

woro really guilty of anything remiss. I know thas throughout

the burcas thore was some sympathy for the agents who had

For example, there was, I think one of the biy things

contered around the fact that whether Oswald was on the su..r
