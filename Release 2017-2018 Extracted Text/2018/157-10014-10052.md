Mr. Wallach. I wantsto be clear. I don’t at this point

We don't need to get into that.

Mr. Cotter. Right.

Mr. Wallach. It's just generally my underatanding that
at the time Clark was the Legat down there, that the Bureau

had some very good sources within the Batista Government, and

what I would like to ask you is from your experience afterwa:
i

lwhen Castro came in, did the Bureau still have sourcos withi:

the Cuban Government from say the period 1961, 1962 and 1952.

Mr. Cotter. I have no knowledge that we had, within the

had contacts in Cuba. A lot of it was unverified, unsubstantic:
there wasn't too much real hard, accurata information availab!«

Mr, Wallach. Do you know Vince Nascu?

Mr. Cotter, Yes, I do, quite weli.

Mr. Wallach, Vince is still with the Bureau, and it is
my understanding that at that time he evolved on the desk that
was working on anti-Castre groups?

Mr. Cotter. Yes, that’s true. in the pugt he's handled
both pro-Castro and anti-Castro. I thiuk his princival speesa.s
has been anti-Castro in recent years.

You don't happen to know offhand when Brennan served as

Mr, Wallach. No, I don’t, but he was there.

Mr. Cotter. Also there was a foreign Liaison unit in

a unit that supervised the operations of all legal attaches an
Nate Ferris was the key man in that. Ho was a supervisor in

you were never told about these plots.
Mr. Cotter, No.
Mr. Wallach. Did you have any direct dealings with anyone
in CIA, er was that handled directly through Papich?

Mr. Cotter. 99 percent of it was handled throuyh Papich,

but occusionally we would meet with our CIA counterparts to

discuss matters of interest. I do not offhand recall any meet:..-

that I had with any CIA people on Cuban affairs. I had a

number of meetings on Chinese matters, I know that.

Mr. Wallach. Did you ever meet Desmond Fitzgerald?

Mr. Cotter. On one occasion, 1 remember meeting him in
a big conference they had, but that had nothing to do with

it's even possible that I may have seen that memo that you just

showed me from Mr, Hoover, but it just didn't register that
I did see it.

Mr, Wallach. It's also my understanding that parts of the

i| memorandum from Mr. Hoover were distributed because they relared
to different subject matters. For example, there was discussion;

between the Attorney General and Mr. Hoover on the Latin Americal

academy.
Mr. Cotter. Yoah.

might have bea!

ie

It wasnafter Castro had been ‘pretty well entrenched in
power for & year or “bo, nd Lansdale came over to sea Belmont,
Le gas!

and I know at that time ri was a “Supervisor in charge of what

they called the Western iemi sphere Unit, which handled Cuban

matters, and Vince Nasca was the supervisor that handled a
jot of Cuban, individual Cuban cases. Sterling Donahoe was the
section chief, at that time, and at Donahoe's instructions,
Nasca and myself accompanied him to Batmont's offica to sit
in on this conference between Belmont and Lansdale, and to
dend whatever support or information Belmont needed.

Mr. Wallach, What took place at that meeting?

Mr. Cotter. There was just a general discussionsof what
could be done about Castro, that sort of thing, what the
Bureau was doing, and what the prospects were for the future,
and I don't recall teo much specific, but I do recali one
thing that occurred that sort of ties in here a little bit
in an indirect way. At some point along the line, toward
the end of the meeting ~- and I think they were just sort of,
Belmont amd Lansdale were kind of saying their amenities, 4
and Selmont nade what 1 knew to be a joking comment about --
Lansdale evidently, I don't .know exactly how he was introduc

but the people attending the meeting, at least my perception v

about Castro,
so forth, and Belmont ‘said’ gonéthing jokingly to him about
why dogan't he hire, I forget whether he used the term Mafia,

or some term about the underworld, and take care of Castro. But

he said it with e smile on his face, and I'm sure it was intended

strictly as humor. Well, the odd part about it was that Lansdal¢
immediately perked up and tock it seriously, and you know, atartd
asking Belmont, well, you know, do you think this could be :
arrangod and this sort of thing. And Belmont was shocked by the
reaction he gut, and he immediately, you know, tried to put

some distance, tried to make it clear to Lansdala that he was

just kidding, and he tried to gat off the subject, and they

a

jnever, Lansdale could never, you know, get him back tovseriou.: os

ta&k about it. But I definitely do remember that little
incident.

Mr. Wallach. This was at a time when Donahoe was still t*

Hr. Cotter. Donahoe was the Section Chief, right, becaus.

‘ wannall was not at this meeting, Tt was just four of us fror

the Bureau: Belmont, ponahoe, Nasca and myself.

2 Mr, Cotter. -I really don't gecali. I'm sure that Nasca

and myself had some things to aay, and Donahoe, too.

Mr. Wallach. Would you have written a memorandum on the
meeting? . :

Mr. Cotter. It would have been normal procedure. It would
be.highly unusuak not to write a memorandum, although it is
possible. I mean, Jt may have been -- this 4a one of those
things that may have fallen between the desk, because maybe it
wasn't clear who was going to write .the memorandum. It could
have been any one of the four of us. but usually, whenever 2
' meeting Like this took place, a memorandum was written for
Nr. Hoover's information if for nothing else.

Mr. Wallach. You don't remember being instructed not te

write a memorandum of thig meeting.

Mr. Cotter. No. I think 1 would remember that, if I

was told not to write it. Chances are there was a memo weities
fat ieast to tell Mr. Hoover what was going on, and especially
lgelmune was very careful to observe the rules in that regars,

Mr. Wallach. Do you know if Lansdale had requested a
seting, or Belmont had requested it?

or Was that general knowledge in
the Bureau te people in this area? :
Mr. Cotter. Well, as I gay, to the best of my racollection

I cannot specifically recall words, but I'm sure Donahoe probably

aye

told Nasca and I that he wanted’us to accompany him to Belmont's
office, that this General Lansdale was going to be there, that hd
had been appointed, I believe, by the White House to head up a
special projects type thing with regard to Cuba, but that was it
It would have been very general, and that we were going alony
just in case Belmont needed some information about what the
Bureau was doing.

Mr. Wallach. All right.

One of the points you said Lansdale wanted to find out was
what the Bureau was doing vie-a-vis Cuba.

What was the Bureau doing vis-a-vis Cuba at that time?

Mr. Cotter. Well, we were investigating very strenuously

jwith regard to any allegations of individuals or groups who were
tor alleged to be engaged in pro-Castro activities. The em

was always on trying to find Cuban intelliyence agents operat:

in the United States, and there wore several cases where we

either identified agents or people were very highly suspected

of such,

Mr. Wallach. Without going into any names at all, we were

bold that the Bureau did have a highly placed source within the

source. He had baenaa source,
took over under Batista. . somehow he managed to maintain his
position after Castro took over at least for awhile. He was
a career type.

Mr. Wallach, Do you know if he was around at the time of
the Konnedy assassination, or you really don't recollact?

Mr. Cotter. No, T don't recall that.

we. Wallach. But was the Bureau doing anything affirmativ

vis-a-vis Cuba? I understand they were in counterintelligence

or in a counterespionage sence trying to detect agents aad ty

to neutralize them. But were they doing anything operations! !)
or assistingly 48 to those operations, OF were they themselves
doing anything against Cuba?

y would say no, definitely not.

Mr. Wallach. Was this after or before the Bay of Pigs,
do you remember? I would thinkiit would be after.

Mr. Cotter. Afterwards you think?

Mr, Wallach. Yea.

Just from my own Knowledge of when Lansdale was appointed.

Mr. Cotter. Yeah. Well, it could have been, it could

maybe they adopted this procedure.

Mr, Wallach. In any event, what was Lanadale briefed upo:
Was he briefed upon Cuban intelligenca axtivities within the

Mr. Cotter. He was told, in other words, roughly what the |

Bureau had developed in terms of how many Cuban sympathisers,

Mr. Wallach. Weil, in a lot of thesa memoranda, Mr. Hoo

refers to the actions of the agents involving the Oswald

|, matter as having embarrassed the Bureau, saying that if

had been more diligent, etc,, they would have been able to
prevent that.

Mr. Cotter. It was an underlying theme in your Buresa.

{| career that anything that embarrassed the Bureau you were «

i to yet ceally highly disciplined on because of Mr. loover':

attitude.

Mr. Hoover that later had to be “supported by official research,

ete., and the Bureau, for example -- that one time, for example

heccame up to the Hill and ‘said the cost of crime was $11

hohe
million or $22 million, and-that had to be documented. But in

any event, what I'm trying to get at is the FBI had 4 security
case on Lao Harvay Oswald prior to the assausination.

Mr. Cotter, Right.

ix. Wallach. And had interviewed him on at least two
occasions.

Mr. Cotter, ‘eah.

Mr. Wallach. And had other information on him.

Now, was there any daacussion that you are aware of as
to whether or not the Bureau would be blamed for the assass~
tion of President Kennedy, or B, if the investigation turne:.
up other information on Oswald that the Bureau itself had ne.
uncovered about any contacts that he may have had with chy
Suviets ur with the Cubans, that this would put the Bur

diacuasion and an inspection which took place, and some people
got censured, and burned,

Me. Wallach, That was Gale's inspection?

Mr. Cotter. Yeah, because of tha fact that in retrospect
they wero deemed not to hava acted properly or thoroughly
enough, and there was a lot of discussion about whether they
were really guilty of anything remiss. I know that throughout
the Bureau there was seme sympathy for the agents who had
buen, at luast many of the ayents who were burned bocause it
was felt that -- and 1 shared this feuliny -- that same of
then were, or had done what waa loyical and everytiing, be
they were being punished because of ti bad publicity resi:
than because of any innate deficiency on their port.

For example, there was, I think one of the big things
centered around the fact that whether Oswald wags on the su-u
