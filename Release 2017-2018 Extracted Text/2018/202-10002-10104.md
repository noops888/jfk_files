1. Reference a requested he Chief of Naval Operations to

provide specified Information on PT type craft, maritime

support needs,

and ways of putting the Soviet furnished Cuban

high speed boats out of actin. Reference b provided certain

data on

PT

craft and specified maritime support.

2. The Cuban PI's are fast (up to 45 knots), highly maneuver-

able, and possess a credible armament consisting of 4-25 mm

(twin) guns, 2-21" torpedo tibes (two torpedoes) and from

12-16 depth charges. In overt conventional naval war

operations these boats would be put out of action quickly,

although an anti-PT defense would have to be established to

protect our troop/cargo carrying ships until the PT's were

eliminated. The primary means of destroying PT craft would

be aircraft delivered rocket/sunfire and surface ship gunfire.

3. There have been no repots on the operations of the Cuban

PT's. They have been deliver.d by Soviet ships to Havana,

offloaded and sailed under thir own power to Mariel. Eight

boats are presently

located a:: Mariel.

Four PT's, delivered

In early April, were st1ll in Havana at last report, but are

expected

to move to Mariel in the near future.. The only way

to put these boats

out of action while they are in port is by

means of agents or swimmer (UIT type) sabotage. Operations

within harbors to put these PT's out of action are risky

in that there is a probability that agents/swimmers would be

captured with subsequent exposure and US complicity. After

the PT's commence to operate, the r pattern of operations will

be studied so as to establish metliods to dispose of them out-

side of their harbors. A wider sectrum of

actions with

less risk should become practical after their pattern of

operations is established:

4. Possible covert/clandestine ways and means of putting

Cuban PT

craft out of action include the following;

a. Fuel contamination. Fuel contamination could be

accomplished either by insertin, foreign material (chemicals)

directly into the craft's fuel system or the fuel supply

ashore (POL). Delivery of the contaminant would be. by

agent or swimmer. Resultant darage would be temporary

mechanical.

Risk of detection rould be high, results would

be minimal in comparison..

b. Limpet mines/demolition charges. Underwater swimmers,

launched from submarines under cover of darkness could

penetrate the PT base. and attach limpet mines to the under-

water body of the craft. Agents

could install demolition

charges in the boats at their piers. Damage resulting from

limpete/demolition charges would be major resulting in

destruction and/or. sinking of thr: boat. Risk of detection

1n operations of this type again: t Havana or Mariel would

be high. PT berthe in both harbors are in secure areas

making agent delivery very difficult. Both harbors are land-

locked with narrow entrances fron the sea. The PT's are

moored at piers well inside the harbor and not on a direct

line from the entrance. The entrinces are guarded by con

tinuously manned machine gun posts on both sides of the

entrance. Boats are known to pat ol during the day, ro

information is available on night boat patrol activity.

currents in the entrances ar: awift. This would possibly

require a swimmer to penetraie on a flood tide and remain

inside the harbor until the bo tide before he would be

able

to effect his escape. Under these conditions, the risk of

swimmer detection through acrident (equipment malfunction or

similar difficulty) would be higher than the benefits

to

be realized

by such operations.

• c. Logistic sabotage.. Sabotage of any portion of the

spare parts supply system would mintmize operational avalla-

billty of the boats. Agents vould be required to perform the

sabotage. Insufficient inforation is available on the

logistic supply system to eva uate the risks involved.

d. Floating debris. Placig floating debris (10gs,

fishing nets, etc.) in PT operating areas would create an

operational hazard. If a PT struck a solid object, the

resultant damage would range from minor hull damage to

destruction depending on the seed and angle at which the ab:

object was struck. Fishing ness, rope and similar material

would foul the screws and temp rarily disable the boat.

Operations of this type would lave to be carefully executed

to insure that the hazard was : ocalized in the PT area to

avoid danger to innocent shipping. While not feasible at

present since

the PT's have not commenced operations,

It may

be practicable at a later time.

e. Lures. Floating devices with explosive charges could

be made into attractive lures by bright paint, emission of

spurious signals (radio/noise) or given other distinguishing

characteristics which would enginder curlosity or demand

Investigation. These devices could be fuzed to explode in

• a number of ways (remote contro:, contact or by handling).

The devices would be planted in the PT operating areas after

they become know. Extreme care would be required in the

conduct of such operations to irsure that innocent shipping

was not endangered. Damage resalting from detonation of the

Ture could extend up to permanent destruction of the boat.

f. Deception. When the operational

pattern is developed

for the PT's, It might be possible to conduct deception

operations that would result in their destruction. Drone

targets, electronic/visual signals, changing positions of

navigational alds or similar acts might be used to cause

the PT's to run into shoal witers or onto a reef. This

1. Referonse a requested the Chief of Naval Operations to

provide specified informatin

on pT type craft, maritime

support needs, and ways of jutting the Soviet furnished Cuban

high speed boats out of action. Reference b provided certain

data on PT crait and specified maritime support.

2. The Cutar PT'S are fast (up to 45 knots), highly minéuvi

able, and possess

a credible armament consisting of 4-25 mm

(twin) guns, 2-21" torpedo üibes (two torpedoes) and from

12-16 depth charges. In overt conventional naval war

operations these boats would be put out of action quickly,

although an anti-PT defense vould have to be established to

protect our troop/cargo carr/ing ships until the PT's were

eliminated. The primary meais of destroying PT craft would

be aircraft delivered rocket, gunfire and surface ship gunfire.

3. There

have

been no reports on the operations of the Cuban

PT's. They

have been delivered by Soviet ships to Havana,

offloaded and sailed under their own power to Mariel. Eight

boats are presently located it Mariel. 'Four PT's, delivered

agent or swimmer. Resultant camage would be temporary

mechanical. Risk of detection would be high, results would

he minimal in comparison.

b. Ilmpet mines/demolition charges. Underwater swimmers,

launched from submarines under cover of darkness could

penetrate the PT base and attach limpet mines to the under-

water body of the craft. Agenis could install demolition

charges in the boats at their 'lers. Damage resulting from

11mpets/demolition charges wou d be major resulting in

destruction and/or sinking of he boat. Risk of detection

in operations of this type aga nst Havana or Mariel would

be high. PT berths in both haibors are in secure areas

making agent delivery very dif:icult. Both harbors are land-

locked with narrow entrances from the sea. The Pr's are

moored at piers well inside the harbor and not on a direct

line from the entrance. The er trances are guarded by con-

tinuously manned

machine gun pests on both sides of the

entrance. Boats are known to latrol during the day, ro

Infornation is available on night boat patrol activity.

rents in the entrances are swift. This would possibly

require a swimmer to penetrate on a flood tide and remain

Inside the harbor

until the ebb tide before he would be able

to effect his

escape. Under shese conditions, the risk of

swimmer detection through accident (equipment malfunction or

similar difficulty) would be h gher than the benefits to

be realized by such operation:.

c. Logistiö sabotage. Sabi tage of any portion of the

spare parts supply system would minimize operational avalla-

billty of the boats. Agents rould be required to perform the

sabotage. Insufficient information 1s available on the

logistic supply system to evaluate the risks involved.

d. Floating debris. Placing floating debris (logs,

f1shing nets, etc.) In PT operiting areas would create an

operational hazard. If a PT siruck a solid object, the

: resultant damage would range f''om minor hull damage to

destruction depending on the sjeed and angle at which the

object was

struck. Fishing net.s, rope and similar material

would foul the screws and temp rarily disable the boat.

Operations of this type would tave to be carefully executed

to insure that the hazard was localized in the PT area to

avold danger

to innocent shipping. ihile not feasible at

present since the PT's have not commenced operations, It may

be practicable at a later time.

of Us

Military Intervention

in. Cuba (TS) (JCS 1969/392)

1. Pursuant to the discussion of the subject item at today's

meeting of the Operations Depities, the following material,

1s submitted for addition to inclosure A (page 4) of the

subject paper:

"3. The Commandant of the larine Corps, while agreeing

that positive and successful nilitary intervention in Cuba

1s fully within current us casability, is of the opinion

that the attached memorandum

Is unduly optimistic in. Its

appraisal of the force requir ments; duration, 'and con-

sequences of such an action. He has expressed the following

reservations with respect to she several elements of the

analysis:

'a. Cost (personnel,

_inits, and equipment)

I notice that this element is treated in

terms of the magnitude of for:e commitment and no specific

estimate is made of cost in tirms of personnel casualties,

material consumed, and equipment to be replaced

or rehabil.

Itated. Even 1f this treatmet is considered acceptable,

I do not consider that the ground forces now shown are adequate

for the intended purpose with the indicated time frame.

If the Castro regime is to be confronted with the prospect

of overpowering force, and casualties reduced by early

capitulation, I consider that a minimum of three (3)

Infantry divisions should be ntroduced immediately after an

entry point has been seized b; amphibious/airborne assault.

" 'D. Level of National Mobilization Required.

(1) Adequate grouid combat forces are avallable

1s increased as Indicated abore. The same situation does

not appear to apply with respect to tactical airlift and

military government/civil affairs units. If all elements

of the intervention force are to have the same degree of

readiness and preparation, It would appear necessary to resort

to partial prior mobilization in these areas.

1:

(2) The foregoing

consideration is addressed

only to direct commitment in (uba.

Restoration of our

capability to resporid quickly to heightened tensions in

other areas might well requir additional mobilization

approaching the scale of that undertaken during the Berlin

crisis.

" 'c. Effect on World-W de Ability to React.

A critical port here is the duration of

Involvement of major elements of our strategic reserve in

Cuba. From examination of tire and distance factors, and

assessment

of the probable leel of opposition, I cannot

agree that the indicated time frame Is adequate

to introduce

and deploy forces of this magistude, establish effective

control, Install an effective new government, turn

over control

to that government, withdraw ind rehabilitate our forces,

and place those forces in a r newed readiness posture in

CONUS.

In my opinion a much: onger time would be involved

and during this period our ab: 1lty to respond to other crisis

would be seriously reduced.

" 'a. Castro-Cuban Coun eraction. The statement 10 made

that Cuban defensive plans ar: believed to contemplate

a strong

Intlal resistance, followed iy a determined defense of

preselected keypoints, and finally by protracted guerrilla

warfare. This statement is f'om the current National

Intelligence Estimate which a so states that the present

military establishment as

a wiole 1s politically reliable.

## Page 39

TOP SECRET SPECIAL MANDLIN® NOFORM

If Castro's Cuba is only partially successful in the execution

of Its defensive plans, combat operations could be of

considerably longer duration than anticipated with personnel

and materiel casualties increasing proportionally.

'e. Possibility of a Requirement for a Sustained

occupation.

The present wording makes no mention of the very

real probability that a US provisional military government

would be required for an extended period of time. Considering

the

size (44,206 sq. m1.) anc population (6,743,000) of Cuba,

Its long history of political unrest, and its tradition of

sustained and extensive guerrIlla and terrorist resistance to

constituted authority, the estimate that only a division-gize

force will be required subseqient to the assault phase appears

modest. I consider it more probable that a clean-up and

occupation force of three infantry divisions and associated

support units would be required for a considerable period.

This is in addition to the need for a military government/

civ1l affairs establishment capable of directing the civil

and econonic affairs of Cuba intil we can organtze and install

a successor regime capable of responsible self-government.

This period of transition, re-organization, and economic

rehabilitation might well concinue for several years.' "

UNITED STATES CONTINGENC I PLAN NO. 2, CUBA (5)

Reference:

Memorandum for lepresentatives of State, Defense,

CIA and USIA, from Chief of Operations, Operation

MONGOOSE, subjest:

"Spontaneous Revolts In Cuba,.

Contingency Plaining", dated 14 June 1962.

Task Agencies:

1. Situation.

a. The purpose of this plan is to define the courses of

action to be pursued by affested agencies of the US

Government in the event that a decision is made that

the United States undertake nilitary intervention in

Cuba.

b. The assumed situation in Cuba is open, wide-

spread revolt. This contingency may be a non-US

initiated situation, similar to that rumored as being

activated for mid-June 1962.

US actions to exploit

the situation include the use of US military force.

c. It is assumed that this plan would be implemented

under the following conditins, and would be considered

for implementation under situations less severe. • An

internal revolt has created a chaotic situation in

Cuba where:

(2) Areas ara taken and held by the revolutionaries,

and;

(3) Leadership of the revolt, unable to overthrow y

the government or sustain the revolution indefinitely,

requests

assistance from

the United States and/or the

Organization of American States (ONS).

d. The United States may, or may not, be able to determine

that

a rebellion is imminent tefore actual outbreak.

However, it is unlikely that the assumed situation will

occur all at

once and without notice.

More. probably it will

evolve from

a localized revolt which will provide some

advance notice and the opportunity to initiate necessary

diplomatic, propaganda, covert and military preparations.

• e. The strength, morale, disposition and equipage of

unfriendly forces will be assuned to be as described in

current estimates of the Unite! States Intelligence Board

(USIB).

2. Mission.

The United States will support and sustain the rebellion

in Cuba through all its resourses including the use of US

military force to assure replazement of the Communist regime

with a new Cuban government acceptable to the United States.

3. Execution.

a. Concept of Operations..

(1) When the likellhood ir emergence of a Cuban

revolt becomes apparent to the US intelligence community

it will be immediately brought to the attention of the

5412 Special Group (Augmented) through the Office of

the Chief of Operations, Operation MONGOOSE. Evaluation

of the situation by the Spectel Group will determine whether

or not the President's cecision should be sought to

implenent this plan.

(2) The initial stages of a spontaneous revolt. will

be supported by the United States through propaganda,

covert operations and other actions as necessary, but

maintaining the appeararce of non-US involvement should

the revolt fail.. In the event that the revolt spreads

as a popular movement afainst the Communist regime, the

United States should be capable of rapid military action

.to forestall a concerte and drastic reprisal program in

the interest of humanity and the mission of this plan.

(3) US Military Reaction.

(a) With no prios warning and with eighteen (18)

days of preparation & coordinated airborne-amphibious

assault could be executed which, it is anticipated,

would gain control of key military installations and

the principal centers of population of Cuba within

ten (10) days and result in minimum US and Cuban

casualties.

(b) A requirement to reduce significantly the pre-

assault period would necessitate incremental commit-

ment of US forces as they could be assembled and em-

ployed. Under this circumstance the time required to

gain essential US military control of Cuba could be

appreciably extended. However, reduction of US mil1-

tary reaction time may be of overriding importance.

In such case, air ani naval forces could attack in

support

of the rebel Cubans with little delay from

the time = decision is made. An alr

assault

could be initisted within eight (8) hours,

an

airborne assault coujs be initiated within five

(5) days and a Navy/l arine amphibious force

could be committed three (3) days later with

a build up to the full-scale effort to follow.

(4) Execution of this plan will be in two (2) phases:

(a) Phase I. After Presidential decision, this

phase will be underteken by the Department of Defense

supported by other agencies of the government. It

will be initiated by

overt US military

assault on

Cuba under the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

and will be terminated at

such time

as essential

military control is gained over the island. The

operation is to be conducted as rapidly as possible,

quichly to confront Cuban forces with sufficient

strength to be clearly beyond enemy capability to

resist and to reduce risk to US units initially

deployed, with a vier toward early capitulation of

Cuban military units and avoidance of needless loss

of life.

(b) Phase II. Flowing the establishment of

essential US military control of the island, this

phase will be primarily concerned with the restora-

tion

of law and order and the establishment of a new

Cuban government friendly to the US. US military

'efforts will be directed primarily to matters of civil

affairs and military government in accordance with

policy established by the Department of State. Mili-

tary operations essertial for the elimination of

small pockets of resistance and restoration of law

and order

throughout the island will continue. Major

US combat forces will be withdrawn as early as

security may permit. Operational responsibility of

the Department of Defense will cease at the time the

Department of state issumes responsibility for civil

administration of Cula.

b. Department of. Defense Operations.

(1) When directed by higher authority, or as the

situation demands, the [apartment of Defense will

initiate preparatory actions

for US military inter-

vention

in Cuba. These

actions may include pre-

positioning forces and

equipment by execution of

current cover and decept on plans.

(2) Upon final decision

of the President, the Joint

Chiefs of Staff will dir ct execution of military

intervention plans for Cuba.

(3) In concept, initiil military operations commence

with

a blockade, concent ated air strikes and coordi-.

nated Naval gunfire to eifect destruction of enemy

air power and to neutralize and destroy as much as

possible of the enemy tark, armor, artillery, and

anti-air capability.

(a) In western Cuts airborne and amphibious

assaults will be condusted by a Joint Task Force

with the initial objective of seizing the city

of Havana and obtainin; control over the seat of

government. Army airborne units will secure the

major airfields in the area as well as major port

areas

required for follow-on forces and logistic

resupply. Navy/Marine amphibious forces will

secure a beachhead in he vicinity of Havana and

designated Army units will follow the Marines over

the beach. The Marine amphibious forces will be

prepared to

re-embark:or further operations as

directed.

(4) Subsequent to thi: seizure of Havana and San-

tiago and the successfu defense of Guantanamo,

operations will be condicted to defeat remaining

pockets of resistance.

Additional amphibious. and

airborne operations may be required. The most likely

areas for such

operations are: Matanzas, Nuevitas,

Nicaro, Trinidad, Bahia de Cochinos, and the Isle of

Pines.

(5) At such time as issential US military control

is gained in Cuba, matters of civil affairs and mili-

tary goverrment will be given priority and undertaken

in accordance with poli‹ y established by the Department

of State. This include: provision for a provisional

military government preyared to assume full legislative,

executive, and judicial control until such functions

can be turned over to other authority on direction in

an expeditious and orderly manner. Remaining resistance

elements of the Communi: t Cuban government, armed forces

or other groups will be isolated, contained and destroyed

or captured

as rapidly is possible. US military combat

units will be scheduled for early return to the United

States consistent with : ecurity considerations.

e. United States Information Agency Operations.

(1) The Agency will provide complete, but strictly

factual and impartial informational coverage to a spon-

taneous revolt in 1ts initial phase. The purpose of

such coverage will be to seep the people of Cuba, and

of the hemisphere, fully informed of developments, and

to set the stage for possible subsequent courses of

action. Extreme caution vill be taken to avoid the .

appearance of US involvemet during this phase so as to

nullify possible later chirges of US intervention (by

Cuba or other Latin Ameri :an governments) should the

revolt fail. In this con ext, the Agency during this

phase must carefully refr in from a type or tone of

coverage that might be costrued as incitement to riot.

(2) In the event of di ect US involvement, the Agency

will:

•(a) Assign informa :lonal specialists to work with

Defense Psywar units diring combat operations.

(b) Staff up a reg ilar USIS unit to move into

Havana with the Departient of State contingent at

the time and place to e decided on by the Department.

(c) Prepare for imiediate shipment all physical

equipment and resource: necessary to support a USIS

operation in Cuba.

(3) Basic consideratio is in Agency informational

support of direct US mili ary action:

(a) Medium wave'

NOFORN

ENCLOSURE C

DISCUSSIJN

1. The approved military plan for US intervention in Cuba

can be executed in eighteen (13) days from a condition of

no warning. It is not anticipited that funds will be

expended nor units pre-positioned to reduce this reaction

time, unless, of course, such reparatory measures can be

clearly related to imminent military action.

Extensive troop

training at this time for a Cuan operation which may not be

executed within the next few years is of questionable value.

Similarly, prestockage of suppies, pre-positioning of forces

and activation of

ships from tie reserve fleet does not

appear justifled if such prepa ations have no likelihood of

being required in the

foreseea ile

future.

2. It is unlikely that a sp ntaneous uprising in Cuba could

develop and

sustain itself for an appreciable length of time

without active and

positive US military sppport.

It is

expected that the United State: would maintain an appearance

of non-involvement

prior. to an decision to intervene. It is

therefore important that US fo: ces be capable of more rapid

response than eighteen (18) da's, first, to sustain a revolt

and, second, to react adequate y to irrational acts or

reprisals by the Communist Cub: n government.

3. Although there are increi sed risks involved in commit-

ting US forces in incremental diployments such

risks may have

to be faced. The most rapid raction possible would be to

employ air power, which is cur: ently being planned by CINCLANT

as directed by the

Joint Chief: of Staff., This air plan coula

be the difference between succuss or failure of any popular

uprising in Cuba. The use of; ir power should be followed

as rapidly as possible by the : ir dropped/air-landed assault.

as planned in CINCLANT OPLAN 3: 6-62, with follow-on amphibious

forces introduced

as soon as fasible, and a build up. to the

full-scale effort of CINCIANI (PLAN 314-61.

ENCLOSURE B:

DISCUSSIJN

1. The United States cannot to erate permanent existence

of a communist government in the lestern Hemisphere. The present

regime in Cuba provides communism with

a base

of operations

for espionage, sabotage and subve: sion against Latin America.

The stability of some

governments in Latin America 1s already

threatened by the overt and cover; actions of the Cuban

government. Continued existence : f this communist government

Increases the probability that on or more other nations in

Latin America will become communit or communist dominated. This

will greatly increase the problem: currently facing the United

States and the Organization of Am rican States. While considered

• unllkely, It 1s possible for the lino-Soviet Bloc to establish

military bases in Cuba similar to US installations around

the bloc periphery.. Establishmen of such bases would increase

Us defense costs. as forces were di veloped or shifted to meet

the threat.*

3. Time favors the Cuban regim and the communist bloc.

They are provided with the opportinity to continue with

their subversion

efforts in Latin America. Increasing

internal security measures by pol: ce

state methods decrease

the possiblllty of Internal uprisings within Cuba.

The

steady improvement in military del enses strengthens the

resistance which must be overcome

the event of

US military

intervention and could lengthen the time required

to secure

control of the government and the island. The continuing

Indoctrination of the Cuban youth creates a growing nucleus

for a communist underground after the elimination of the present

government.. This

creates a problm

for the future

which 1s

steadily Increasing in magnitude.

1. Reference a requested the Chief of Naval Operations to

provide specified Information on PT type craft, maritime

support needs, and ways of put -ing the Soviet furnished Cuban

high speed boats. out of action. Reference b provided certain

data on PT

craft and specified maritime support.

2. The Cuban PT's are fast (up to 45 knots), highly maneuver-

able, and possess a credible a mament consisting of 4-25 mm

(twin) guns, 2-21" torpedo tubes (two torpedoes) and from

12-16 depth charges. In overt conventional naval war

operations these boats would b: put out of action quickly,

although an anti-PT defense wold have to be established to

protect our troop/cargo carrylig ships until the pr's were

eliminated. The primary means of destroying PT craft would

be aircraft delivered rocket/ginfire and surface ship gunfire.

3. There have been no reports on the operations of the Cuban

PT's. They have been deliverel by Soviet ships to Havana,

offloaded and sailed under their own power to Mariel. Eight

boats are presently. located at Mariel. Four PT's, delivered

1n early April, were still in lavana at last report, but are

expected to move to Mariel in the near future.

The only way

to put these boats out of action while they are in port 1s by

means of agents or swimmer (ULI type) sabotage. Operations

within harbors to put these pl's out of action are risky

In that there 1s a probability that agents/swimmers would be

captured with subsequent exposure and US complicity.

After

the PT's commence to operate, their pattern of operations will

be studied

so as to establish nethods to dispose

of them out

side

of their harbors.

A wides spectrum of actions with

less risk should become practical after their pattern of

operations is established.

4. Possible covert/clandestine ways and means of putting

Cuban PT craft out of action 1 clude the following:

a. Fuel contamination.

ruel contamination could be

accomplished either by inse ting foreign material (chemicals)

directly. into the craft's fiel system or the fuel supply

ashore (POL). Delivery of he contaminant would be by

agent or swimmer. Resultan: damage would be temporary

mechanical. Risk of detect on would be high, results would

be minimal in comparison.

D. Limpet mines/demolition charges. Underwater swimmers,

launched from submarines unter cover of darkness could

penetrate the

PT base and a: tach limpet mines to the under-

water body. of the

craft. Arents could install demolition

charges in the boats at the:r piers. Damage resulting from

limpets/demolition charges vould be major resulting in

destruction and/or sinking ‹f the boat.

Risk of detection

In operations of this type i gainst Havana or Mariel would

be high.

PT berths in both harbors

are in secure areas

making agent delivery very ¿ifficult. Both harbors are land-

locked with narrow entrances from the sea. The Pl's are s

moored at piers well

Inside the harbor and not on a direct

line from the entrance. The entrances are guarded by con-

tinuously manned machine gur posts on both sides of the

entrance.

currents in the entrances are swift. This would possibly

require a swimner to penetrate on a flood tide and

remain

inside the harbor until the ebb tide before he would be able.

to effect his escape. Under these conditions, the risk of

swimmer detection through

¿ccident (equipment malfunction or

similar difficulty) would be higher than the benefits to

be realized by such operations.

c. Logistic sabotage. Sabotage of any portion of the

spare parts supply system nould minimize operational availa-

bility of the boats. Agents would be required to perform the

sabotage. Insufficient information 1s available on the

logistic supply system to evaluate the risks involved.

d. Floating debris. Plasing floating debris (10gs,

fishing nets, etc.) in PT coerating areas would

create an

operational hazard.. If a FI struck a solid object, the

resultant damage would range from minor hull damage to

destruction depending on the speed and

angle at which the ap

object was struck. Flshing nets, rope and similar material

would foul the screws and temporarily disable the boat.

Operations of this type would have to be carefully executed

to insure that the hazard wis localized in the PT area to

avoid danger to innocent shipping. While not feasible at

present since the PI's have not commenced operations, It may

be practicable at a later time.

e. Lures. Floating devices with explosive charges could

be made into attractive lur's by bright paint, emission of

spurious signals (radio/noise) or given other distinguishing

characteristics which would engender curiosity or demand

investigation. These devics could be fuzed to explode in

a number of ways (remote.co.trol, contact or by handling).

The devices would be plantel in the PT operating areas after

they become know. Extreme are would be required in the

conduct of such operations o insure that innocent shipping:

endangered. Damage resulting from detonation of the

lure could extend up to

permanent destruction of the boat.

I. Deception. When the operational pattern 1s developed

for the PT's, 1t might be fossible. to conduct deception

operations that would result in their destruction. ' Drone

targets, electronic/visual signals, changing positions of

navigational alds or similar acts might be used

to cause

the PT's to run into shoal waters or onto a reef.

This

form of operation could also be used to divert the attention

of patrolling PT's from other operations being conducted.

5. Although the Navy has ways and means

available to destroy

or neutralize the Cuban PT boats, none can be covertly

executed in Cuba

without undue risk of exposure until more

Information 1s obtained on the degree of their security

protection. Under conditions of overt warfare, the Navy can

quickly dispose of the Cuban FI's.

The Navy will continue

to watch closely the activities of the cuban Pr's and will

recommend appropriate means tc dispose of them when

7. From

a military point of lew, the primary value of air-

for defense against communist i filtration and subversion, it.

1s not feasible for the US to sonsor at this time the establish

9. At the 8th Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the OAS,

member States collectively took recognition of the threat posed

to the Western Hemisphere by

One of

the actions taken to combat this threat was the

establishment of

Secretary of Defense, dated 6 March 1962, which transmitted the

request of the Joint Chiefs of staff, tne Deputy Under Secretary

of State stated on 20 March 1962 that:

"The establishment of nilitary facilities in Haiti

raises a number of basic questions with

respect to our

policy toward the present ([uvalier) regime, and requires

most careful consideration."

The Departuent of State, is currently conducting an analysis

of our future policy in regard to the present

government of

Hait1. An early availability of a US facility in Halti,

however, could assist in the performance of the functions

envisioned for a US manned "patrol post" in haiti.

7. During this critical period, maximum use will continue

to be made of US forces in the Caribbean area (CINCLANT, CINCARIB,

MAAGs, Missions, and Attaches) in cooperation, where possible,

with Latin American military forces to perform the functions

envisioned for the "patrol posts." For example, training

operations at Guantanamo Naval Base, normal patrol activity,

and traffic between that base end US naval installations in

Puerto Rico provide effective cir-sea surveillance of eastern

Cuba and the island of Hispanicla including Haiti.

8. In view of the foregoing, it is recommended that no

further action be taken in regerd

1. The Foreign Ministers of the Organization of the

American States (OAS) at their eighth meeting* took

cognizance

of the

threats to the peace and security of the

Western Hemisphere as a result of communist infiltration.

The Council of the OAS (COAS) was requested to "maintain all

and security, or the preparation of such acts, resulting from

the continued intervention

to make recomn endations to

2. As directed by

the Foreign Ministers of the OAS at their

the COAS has established a Special Consultative

this committee

with studying the threat to the hemisphere and recommending to

the COAS measures which

DISCUSSION

1. The communist threat to the Western Hemisphere through

infiltration and subversion wa; recognized by the Foreign

Ministers of

the OAS at their 3th Meeting at Punta del Este and

action was initiated to find

means to combat it.

The results

of the COAS Special Committee

should provide measures which

could be taken on a collective basis to guard against and

combat the threat.

2. Cuban military forces lak the capability to launch a

meaningful attack against any atin American country with the

possible exception of Haiti. in the case of Haiti, the

capability is limited to a ligitly armed invasion using

a few

aircraft and/or small boats.

3. Any invasion of

a Caribb:an country by. Cuban forces would

serve only to further unite th governments of Latin America

and lead to collective-OAS

act on under the terns of the Treaty

of Non-Intervention. Further, a Cuban landing on the territory

of another country could provine

a valid justification for US

military intervention in Cuba. Any attempt to export communism.

from Cuba would be nost likely by infiltration and subversion

and

would take the form of an

ndigenous revolutionary move-

ment, supported by arms from Chiba and perhaps Cuban volunteers,

and would be made to appear as an uprising against the incumbent

government.

4. Surveillance of Cuban coi stal areas and the entire

Caribbean is within the capabiity of US aircraft and/or ships

essigned to the Atlentic Comman:. Also, US forces

and facilities

in

the Caribbeanare adequate ti prevent any, invasion of

Caribbean country by Cuban forces.

From a military point of

view, the primary value. of "patrol posts" would be in acquiring

advanced information of Cuba's actions and indications of

intentions.

The value of groud "patrol posts", even considering

governmental agreements could le effected, is questionable in

view of the nature of the threit from Cuba.

5. Although the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider there is l1ttle

military justification for esta lishing multilateral forces for

use in the Caribbean

area, the colitical results of

such an effort

may have some value

in gaining

urther recognition of the threat

and in strengthening national tes between participating countries.

Based upon the past indications from Central American governments

In regard to the negotiation of bilateral assistance agreements,

and the present relations betwen the US and Cuba, it does not

appear feasible for

the US to sonsor a "patrol post" concept in

the Caribbean area at this

time

Additionally any consideration

of such a proposal must conside: the possible effects on the

treaty with Cuba for the use of Guantanamo Naval Base, 1f 1t 1s

to be used

as a

"patrol post."

6. In specific regard to a g: ound "patrol post" in Haiti, the

Joint Chiefs of Staff by memorandum* to the Secretary of Defense,

dated 4 January 1962, stated thire was a requirement for an

amphibious training and staging facility in Haiti and

requested

that the Department of

State, subject to political assessment of

the political considerations in olved, make necessary governmental

arrangements for the conduct of surveys and for subsequent

arrangements on specific requir ments that are developed. The

Department

of State has indicatrd a reluctance to negotiate with

the present Government of Haiti until a thorough analysis is

made with respect to US policy loward the present Duvalier

regime. The early availability of this facility, however, would

meet any requirement for a US "jatrol post" in Haiti. In the

meantime, training operations

al Guantanamo Naval Base, normal

patrol activity, and traffic

between that

base and US naval

installations in Puerto Rico provide effective air-sea

surveillance

of eastern Cuba anc the island of Hispaniola

including Haiti.

7: The most feasible course

if action, likely to be acceptable

to the countries concerned, to contend with Cuban Infiltration and

subversion of Caribbean countries lies in collective efforts of the

OAS. Past indications from governrents of Caribbean countries have

been to the effect that collective OAS efforts and actions are

case, appropriate consideratior of the recommendations for

action, to be submitted by the Special Committee on Security

of the COAS, should provide a lasis to accomplish the objective.

8. During this interim perir1, maximum use should continue

to be made of US forces in the Caribbean area (CINCLANT, CINCARIB,

MAAG's, Nissions, and Attaches) and the Latin American military

forces to perform the functions envisioned for the "patrol

posts. "i

9. Any actions to establish "patrol posts" as such in the

Caribbean area would require apropriate "cover" to hide or

obscure the real purpose. While several means are available,

(civilian commercial interests, activities associated with the

Atlantic Missile Range, etc.), the ostensible purpose would

surely invoke strong reaction from the Cuban government and

might jeopardize the over-all sacurity of "Operation Mongoose."

THE PRC BLEM

1. To develop the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

with reference to two question posed by General Taylor at

the meeting of the Special Group (5412), 5 April 1962, re-

lated to possible sentences for the invasion prisoners as

follows:

a. Do the Joint Chiefs of Staff belleve that the United

States should intervene?

b. Does the United States have the capability to

Intervene?

FACTS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM

2. Past considerations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have

been reviewed for opinions or cecisions related to General

Taylor's first question. Two studies are appropriate; however,

both studies were directly concerned with the current Cuba

Project (Mongoose).

a. The first study,* dated 8 February 1962:

A significant conclusion of this study states that

the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe the overthrow of the

Communist Cuban Regime can ke accomplished without pre-

cipitating general war and vithout serious effect on world

public opinion if, among otter things, the impression 1s

created that there is an urgent, humanitarian requirement

to restore order in Cuba.

CONCLUIIONS

5. The Secretary of Defense hould be advised during the

meeting of 10 April that execut on of 100 or more Cuban prison-

ers should be exploited (with petexts and an expanded propa-

ganda campaign if necessary) by the US as justification for

intervention.

6. The Secretary of Defense hould be advised that there

deliberate course of implementig such action within 18 days

after decision is more prudent shan the faster but riskier

the question of US military intervention in Cuba except within

MEMORANDUM FOR THE S!:CRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject: Cuba (IS)

• 1. The Joint Chiefs of Stafi believe that the Cuban problem

must be solved in the near futire.

Further, they see no

prospect of early success in o'erthrowing the present communist

regime either as a result of ir ternal uprisings or external

political, economic or psychol gical pressures. Accordingly

they believe that military intervention by the United States

will be required to overthrow the present communist regime.

2. The United States cannot tolerate permanent existence

of a communist

government in the Western Hemisphere.

The

present regime

operations for

in Cuba provide: communism

with a base

of

espionage, sabotage 'and suversion against

Latin America.

The stability f

some governments in Latin

America is already

threatened ty the overt and covert actions

of the Cuban government. Continued existence of

this con-

munist government increases the

probability that one or

more other nations in Latin America will become communist

or communist dominated. This vill

greatly increase the

problems

currently facing the Inited States and the Organiza-

tion

of American States:

while considered unlikely, it is

possible for the Sino-Soviet Bloc to establish military

bases in Cuba similar to US installations around the bloc

periphery. Establishment of sich bases would increase US

defense costs

as

forces were developed or shifted to meet

the threat.

3. Time favors the Cuban regime and the communist bloc.

their subversive efforts in Latin America. Increasing

internal security measures by folice state methods decrease

the possibility of internal u risings within Cuba.

The

steady improvement in military defenses strengthens the

resistance which must be overcome in the

event of US military

intervention and could lengthen the time required to secure

control of the government and the island.

The continuing

indoctrination of the Cuban yeuth creates a growing nucleus

for a communist underground after the elimination of the present

government. This creates a problem for the future which is

steadily increasing in magniti de.

4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the United States

can undertake military intervention in Cuba without risk

general war. They also beliere that the intervention can be

accomplished rapidly enough tr minimize communist opportunities

for solicitation of UN action.

Forces available would assure

rapid essential military contiol of Cuba. Continued police

action would be required.

5. In view of the increasirg military and subversive threat

to the United States and the rations of the Western Hemisphere

posed by the communist regime in Cuba, the Joint Chiefs of Staff

recommend that a national policy of early military intervention

in Cuba be adopted by the United States. They also recommend

that such intervention be undertaken as soon as possible and

preferably before the release of National Guard and Reserve

forces presently on active duty.

forces in CINCLANT OPLAN 314-61 are adequate to gain essential

fies this judgment to depend on the following:

"a. Intelligence avallabl: to this command concerning the

"b. The amphibious assaul: lift now available in LANICOM

ENCLOSURE C

DISCUE SION

1. In addition to related considerations of the Joint Chiefs

of Staff, additional factors which support US intervention in

Cuba, if 100 or more prisoners are executed, are:

a. Guidellnes establishe for Phase II of Operation Mon-

goose, already amroved by tre Special Group, indicate that mili-

tary intervention must eventually be resorted to for overthrow

of the Communist Cuban regine.

b.. The passage of time favors Castro rather than the US.

c. Justification

for US intervention will probably be more

convincing to the rest of the world if it can be related to

a real and valid provocation rather than based entirely on

manufactured pretexts which entail some risk of compromise.

The US could, however, bolster the justification for Inter-

vention, if required, to provide a stronger case for US

military action.

d. Execution of significant numbers of prisoners would

adversely affect the faith ad resolution of refugee Cubans

and the Cuban underground in future attempts to resist the

Communist regime, if they feel

that the US has ignored, in

apparent disinterest, the fial chapter of last year's

invasion attempt.

2. US intervention in Cuba could trigger Bloc diversionary

tactics in other parts of the world (most

probably. in known

trouble spots such as Laos, Sou:h Vietnam, Korea, the Offshore

Islands, Berlin or possibly the Mid-East) and would likely

engerider propaganda campaigns t, include use of the UN forum

for pressure against the US. Hwever, the essential and most

Important element of the US pla, against Cuba is speed.

CINCLANT'S OPIAN states, "Some , days

should

be expected that US forces committed to Cuba will be

unavailable for other continger cies for only about 20 days,

3. The fastest means of applying

force against Cuba would

be through the use of US air power (Naval plus USAF), although

this would be an interim measure until surface forces could be

deployed. This capability, nor being prepared by CINCLANT as

Cuban air power, reduction of round forces (especially armor),

Talking Paper for the Chairman. JCS for the Secdef Meeting,

10 April 1962

Subject: US Interventin in Cuba

Background - At the meeting

of the Special Group (augmented) on 5

Apr 62,

General Taylor questioled the US course of action in

the event Castro decided to ex cute about 100 of last April's

invasion prisoners.

Inconclus.ve discussion led General Taylor

to ask

"Suppose Castro decidel to shoot them all, what would

we do then?"

Mr. Johnson, for

state, expressed the opinion that

even this extreme would not provide

sufficient justification

for US military action.

Mr. G :lpatric

for Defense

Parker for the JCS,

Indicated hey reit both the seb and the jes

would stand firm for military intervention.

During the JCS me ting, 6 Apr 62, discussion of

this subject developed two basic questions:

a, Do the JCS believe th: US should intervene?

b. Does the US have the capability?

Discussion - Past consideratiois of the JCS have been reviewed

for opinions or decisions relaced to General Taylor's first

question.

Iwo studies are app'opriate; however,

both studies

were directly concerned with

tie current Cuba Project (Mongoose).

a. JC3 1969/303, 8 Feb 62:

A significant conclusion of this study states that the

JCS believe the

overthrow of the Communist Cuban Regime

can be accomplished without precipitating general war and

One of the situatlons listed, which depended upon

- In addition to trese related considerations of the

JCS, additional factors which support US intervention in Cuba,

if 100 or more prisoners are executed, are:

a. Guidelines established for Phase II of Operation Mon-

Gary Intervention rose ever tually de resorted to for over-

CINCLANT qualifies his judgment to depend on the

a. SECDEF should be adv: sed during the meeting of 10 Apr

that execution of 100 or m-re Cuban prisoners should be ex-

ploited (with pretexts and an expanded propaganda campaign

if necessary) by the US as justification for intervention.

b. SECDEF should be adv. sed that there is no question of

US capability to intervene

and that the deliberate course

of implementing such actio: within 18 days after decision

is more prudent than the fister but riskier course of piece-

meal force commitments.

c. Inasmuch as the JCS lave not addressed the question

of US military Interventio1 in Cuba except within the context

of Operation Mongoose it a pears desirable that military.

result from a period of heigitened US-Cuban tensions which

place the United States in tie position of suffering justif-

forum

should be favorably a'fected by developing the inter-

national image of the Cuban overnment as rash and irresponsible,

and as an alarming and unpre lictable threat to the peace of

the Western Hemisphere.

1. Reference is made to m morandum from Chief of operations,

dated 5 March 1962, which re juested brief but precise

description of pretexts whic, the Joint Chiefs of Staff

2.

The projects Ilsted in the enclosure hereto are forwarded

as a preliminary submission suitable for planning purposes.

It is assumed that there will be similar submissions from

other agencies. and that thes: inputs will be used as a basis

for developing a time-phased plan..

The individual projects

can

then be considered on a case-by-case basis.

3. This plan, incorporating projects selected from the

attached

suggestions, or fron other sources, should be

developed to focus all efforts on a specific ultimate

objective which would provide adequate Justification for

US military intervention. Sich

a plan would enable a logical

build-up of incidents to be combined with other seemingly

unrelated events to camouflaze the ultimate objective and

create the necessary impression of Cuban rashness and

irresponsibility on a large scale, directed at other

countries as well as the United States. The plan would also

properly integrate and time phase the courses of action to

be pursued. The desired resultant from the execution of

this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent

position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and

Irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an inter-

national Image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western

Hemisphere.

PRETEXTS TO JUSTIFY US M LITARY INTERVENTION IN CUBA

(Note:. The courses of ac iion which follow are a preliminary

submission suitable only for planning purposes. They are

arranged neither chronologicilly nor in ascending order.

Together with similar Inputs from other agencies, they are

Intended to provide a point i departure for the development

of a single, Integrated, tim:-phased plan. Such a plan would

permit the evaluation of individual projects within the context

of cumulative, correlated actions designed to lead inexorably

to the objective of adequate justification for US military

Intervention in Cuba).

1. Since 1t would seem desirable to use legitimate

provocation as the basis for

US military intervention in Cuba

a cover and deception plan, to Include requisite preliminary

actions such as has been de eloped in response

to Task 33 c,

could be executed as an initial effort to provoke Cuban

reactions. Harassment plus

deceptive actions to convince the

Cubans of imminent invasion would be emphasized. Our military

posture throughout executio

of the plan will allow a rapid

change from exercise to intrrvention if Cuban response justifies.

2. A serles of well coor inated incidents will be planned

to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine

appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.

a. Incidente to estab ish a credible attack (not in

chronological order):

(1) Start rumors (lany). Use clandestine radio.

(2) Land friendly jubans in uniform "over-the-fence"

to stage attack on base.

(3) Capture Cuban friendly) saboteurs inside the

base.

(4) Start riots neir the base main gate (friendly

Cubans) .

(5) Blow up ammunition Inside the base; start fires.

(6) Burn aircraft in air base (sabotage).

(7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base.

Some damage

(8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea

or vicinity of Guantar amo City.

(9) Capture militi: group which storms the base.

(10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires - napthalene.

(11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduet funerals

for mock-victims (may be lleu of (10)).

b. United States woul respond by executing offensive

operations to secure watr and power supplies, destroying

artillery and mortar emp. acements which threaten the base.

c. Commence large sca: e United States military operations.

3. A "Remember the Maine'

incident could be arranged in

several forms:

a. We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and

blame Cuba.

b. We could blow up a drone (unmanned) vessel anywhere

in the Cuban waters. We could arrange to cause such. incident

In the vioinity of

Havan:: or Santiago as a spectacular result

of Cuban attack from the air or sea, or both.

The presence

of Cuban planes or ships merely Investigating the intent of

the vessel could be fairy compelling evidence that the ship

was taken under attack. The nearness to Havana or Santiago

would add credibility especially to those people that might

have heard the blast or lave seen the fire. The US could

follow up with an alr/se., rescue operation covered by US

fighters to "evacuate" r maining members of the non-existent

crew.

Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful

wave of national indigna :lon.

4. We could develop a Co munist Cuban terror campaign 1n

the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington.

TOP SECRET SPECIAL HANDLIN: NOFORN

The terror campaign could be pointed at

Cuban refugees seeking

haven in the United States. We could sink a boatload of Cubans

enroute to Florida (real or simulated). We could foster attempts

on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the

extent of wounding in instarses to be widely publicized.

Exploding a few plastic bomks in carefully chosen

spots, the

arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents

substantiating Cuban involvenent also would be helpful in

projecting the idea

of an 11 responsible government.

5. A "Cuban-based, Castri-supported" filibuster

could be

simulated against a neighbor ing Caribbean nation (In the vein

of the 14th of June invasior of the Dominican Republic). We

know that Castro 1s backing subversive efforts clandestinely

against Haiti, Dominican Rerublio, Guatemala, and Nicaragua at

present and possible others. These efforts can be magnified

and

additional ones contrived for exposure. For example, advantage

can be taken

of the sensitivity of the Dominican Air Force to

Intrusions within their national air space.

"Cuban" 3-26 or

C-46 type aircraft could male cane-burning raids at night.

Soviet Bloc incendiaries could be found. This could be coupled

with "Cuban" messages

to the Communist underground in the

Dominican Republic and "Cuban" shipments of arms which would

be found, or intercepted, or the beach.

6. Use of MIG type aircreft by US pilots could provide

additional provocation. Harassment of civil air, attacks on

surface shipping and destruction of ÜS military drone aircraft

by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions.

An F-86 properly painted world convince air passengers that they

saw, a Cuban MIG, especially if the pilot of the transport were.

to announce such fact. The primary drawback to this suggestion

appears to be the security lok inherent in obtaining or modify-

ing an aircraft. However, leasonable copies of the MIG could

be produced from US resources in about three months.

7. Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft

should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the

government of Cuba. Concurrently, genuine defections of Cuban

civil and military air and surface craft should be encouraged.

8. It is possible to create an incident which will 'demonstrate

convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down

a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States to

Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama cr Venezuela. The destination would

be chosen only to cause the flight plan

route to cross Cuba.

The passengers could be a group of college students off on a

holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest

to

support chartering a non-scheduled flight.

a. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and

numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered

aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the

Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be

substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be

loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under

carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered

aircraft would be converted to a drone.

b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual

aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of

Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying

aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly

into an auxillary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will

have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the

aircraft to 1ts original status. The drone aircraft

meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When

over cuba the drone will being transmitting on the inter-

national distress frequer cy a "MAY DAY" message stating he

is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission

will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will

be triggered by radlo signal. This will allow ICAO radio

has happened to the aircraft instead of the US trying to

"sell" the incident.

9. It is possible to crete an incident which will make it

appear that Communist Cuban MIGs have destroyed a USAF aircraft.

over international waters ir an unprovoked attack.

a. Approximately 4 or 5 F-101 aircraft will be dispatched

in trail from Homestead /FB, Florida, to the vicinity of cuba.

Their mission will be to reverse course and simulate fakir

aircraft for an air deferse exercise in southern Florida.

These aireraft would con uct variations of these flights at

frequent intervals. Crevs would be briefed to remain at

least 12 miles off the liban coast; however, they would be

required to carry live a munition in the event that hostile

actions were taken by the Cuban MIGs.

b. On one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would fly

tall-end Charley at cons: derable interval between aircraft.

While near the Cuban Islind this pilot would broadcast that

he had been jumped by MI's and was going down. No other

calls would be made. Th pilot would then fly directly

west at extremely low al:itude and land at a secure base, an

Eglin auxiliary. The al craft would be met by the proper

people, quickly stored ad given a new tail number. The

pilot who had performed she mission under an allas, would

resume his proper identisy and return to his normal place

of business.

The pilot ind aircraft would then have

disappeared.

c.. At precisely the same time that the aircraft was

presumably shot down a sibmarine or small surface craft

would disburse F-101 parts, parachute, etc., at approximately

15 to 20 miles off the Cuban coast and depart. The pilots

returning to Homestead would have a true story as far as

they knew.. Search ships and aircraft could be dispatched

and parts of aircraft feund.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

Subject:

Guidance from the Deputy Secretary of Defense

and his Reaction to Original Proposed Policy

for CIA Support by the Department of Defense

of Caribbea Survey Group (30 January 1962)

Mr. Gilpatric did not like this paper at all.. He indicated

the paper was too negative and restricted as though a policy

towards an enemy like we are dealing with the Germans or Itallans,

not a fellow department of our Government. Tats is a red line

operation with the blessin of the President and approved by

him as a most important taik. This is probably the most

Important mision we have n the government today. When a

request comes In fron CIA, you (Craig) will evaluate. It and

request the Joint Chiefs o' Staff for their evaluation and

recommendations. The Secritary of Defense will determine,

after considering the advise of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, what

the decision will be, not she Joint Chiefs of Staff. This

decision is the prerogative of the Secretary of Defense.

We do not want to get involved in a case-by-case basis. We

do not want individual actions on each case. We do not want

masses

of Individual actions. This is a red line priority

problem and must be handled with dispatch and without getting

Involved in minutia regarcing

expenses and reimbursement or

other details. Department of Defense may have to do It themselves

regardless who foots the 11ll. In some cases, CIA will be

required to reimburse if; o determined by the Secretary of

Defense. This 19 a matter which must be decided by the

Secretary of Defense - no: the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The

Department of Defense bud jets for some CIA support. We have

equipment of some types liring around not being used and should

not require reimbursement for this type, as a general rule. This

must be decided by the Se:retary of Defense after considering

an evaluation by the Services and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

There are some assetsPEGAl HANDLINd without and should make

these types available to the CIA without necessarily being

reimbursed for 1t. Mr. Gilpatric does not object to the

Joint Chiefs of Staff recomending to the Secretary of

Defense what equipment should be used for accomplishment of

stated mission and specific projects.

I explained to Mr.

Gilpatric that we were not trying to obstruct the operation,

that we read our message loit and clear. I showed him Mr.

Bob Kennedy's Ifstructions concerning which hu stated: "I

can't add anything to that.'

I discussed my meeting with Mr. McNamara of last Saturday

with Mr. Gilpatric. He indicated that Mr. McNamara had been

preoccupied on the Hill and had not known of latest developments

on this project, that he wold inform him in regard to Mr.

McNamara's apprehensions as expressed to me last Saturday

concerning security, numbers in the Department of Defense who

knew of the project, etc. Ir. Gilpatric said I could inform

the people necessary regarding the project in order to get

the

job done.. This was up to my judgment. Mr. Gilpatric made

it clear that I was the DOD Representative and he wanted me to

make recommendations concerting requests for CIA support.

I emphasized the urgert requirement that the Services

and Chiefs should determine the proper personnel and equipment

to be used for specific tasts since they were better qualified

as to capability and limitaiion of their equipment and personnel

than the CIA.

In summary, Mr. Gilpairie recognized the need for the estab-

lishment of a policy on thii. subject. He was most emphatic

that the

decision as to whether or not a request was approved

was the prerogative of the lecretary of Defense NOT the Joint

Chiefs of Staff. However, he Secretary of Defense would l1ke

FACTS BEARIIG ON THE PROBLEM

1.. The over-all plan* for the overthrow of the Castro

gover went is responnive to he following objective:

he US objective

is tr help the Cubans overthrow

che conmunist regime from within Cuba and institute a

rew government with which the United States can live in

pease."

2. It is becoming increas ngly evident that the Castro regine,

aide matesially, morslly anl financially by the Sino-Soviet

Bloc, has become firnly entrinched. Over the cast two and one-

half jeano, the Castro regim: has graduaily built up a police

state on the Sino-Soviet model. The first stew was the

Inmentee replacement of the existing Cuban Arny and police

force by revolutionary units which had fought with Castro during

the revolution in the hills ind in the underground. Changes in

the Navy and Air Force were ccomplished through purges of top

personnel.

Toward the end o? 1959 as disillusionment and opposi-

tion over the drift

toward closer association with the sino-

Soviet Bloc began to crystalize within the regular armed forces,

the regime again shifted its basis of power, this time to the

newly-formed civilian worker -peasant-student rilitia. Dr. Castro

looked upon this militia as a presumably more reliable military

force. For almost a year the militia maintained its status as

a para-military organizatior under labor union and student

federation leadership.

on ¿) September 1960, Castro reorganized

the nilitia along military Iines and the chief of the corresponding

military district took over conmand of the militia units.

specifically trained officers replaced the original militia

commanders and military training was

accelerated.

secur-ty network*

: In Jure: 961, the process vulminated with

the establishment o" & Minis ry of Interior with reponsibility

for antoning "puttic orde:". The decree certralizes the

variiis pojice and investiga ion units under the new ministry.

• It also gave the Ministry au hority to suvervise the activities

of "Commistees for the Dorenie of the Revolurion". These

comaste. aro respundibic for inforning authouities of "counter-

revoiationary' activities or attitudes. A campaign is under way

to establich 100,000 of such committees with 50, 000 'volunteer"

nembers in offices, factories, schools, churches, conneratives,

residents areas, ete. By entraiizing the police function

and combscing it wiür a vast network of itorners, the Castro

regine haa estaolished a security systen on the

Communist Bloc

indicate that certaln material is rather sophisticated, and

and internal security. This represents a continuous threat to

fewer forces initially, o estimate is made concerning the

To dite, exiled Cubans have failed to

5. It is postulated ther fore, that to progress in following

6. It: is clear that the linited States cannot afford repetition

of Fidel Castro in the desi:e to sus an end to the Batista regine.

It would appear that a sign ficant lesson of

this costly mistake

is the requirement for emphisis and Improvement in US Intelligence

efforts to evaluate the tru: colors of potentially capable

personalities and groups wh ch

eventually may have to be

recognized and supported by the United States in future counter-

7. The basic military im lications of Castro's Communist

government are as

follows:

a. It exposes the Wes ern Hemisphere to an increasingly

serious threat to its security. This increases our national

vulnerability and defens: costs as forces are developed or

shifted to meet this

b. It provides the Soilet Union with the most effective
