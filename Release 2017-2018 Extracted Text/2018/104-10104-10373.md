Case 49364 - Possible Involvement of
George Brown in Garrison Matter

2 Haynes/Musslia Folecon $ Jan 68

1, I connection with referenced telecon and in anticipation of
receipt of memo on this request from Musulia, Haynes contacted
Herbert Frensley ond learned that he would only be available early in
the morning of 8 January as he was leaving town for several days at
mid-morning. Feeling that he was fairly well informed on what Musulin
would request in his meno, Waynes made arrangements to see Frensley
befere he left towa.

2. WFrensley stated that there have been no further developments
in the Gurevich approach (through the Hewsweek correspondent) to Brown.
Frensley bad advised Brown to ignore the matter and thus far he has.
Frensley says that Brown has not the slightest intention of trying to
gain access to the documents referred to by the ewsweek correspondent.

3. Frensley was most appreciative ef the small amount of back-

ground we could furaish him on Gurevich and his methods. We will keep
you informed {£ there are further developments.
