Request for Information on 201 Criteria (S)

OLC 78-0070/19, 23 February 1978

1. (S) With reference to the conversation of

27 February between Mr. Shepanek and Mr. Cleffi of ISS,

HSCA Staff has led us to conclude that the most complete

and effective way to respond would be by inviting the

Staff to review our regulation governing the criteria for

opening, maintaining, controlling and closing 201 files

by the Operations Directorate.

A careful reading of the

regulation provides an answer

to

every question posed by

the Staff.

(S) The earlier version of the regulation is

included to reflect the situation as it existed in the

period of their primary concern (1958-1964). The later

version provides

expansion, clarification and refinement

of the

earlier

versions.

ANNEX B

THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I, 27 October 1966

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest in justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e, 201-1234567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form

831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie., per-

sonal history, current status, and prospects.

c. The Master 201 Record; a machine record generated by the opening of

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Indes and

stores the portinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

d. Main. Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-

erence consolidated.

e. Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-

sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual

with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli

gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or

suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI

codes for use by components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services

or other specific organizations.

, component may request an OI code be established by rubmitting a mem

randum to the DDO/RMO. through the component Hecords Managemen

Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An Ol code may be assigned

when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see

paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added

at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201

personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the

security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members

of that service.

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of personalities ori whom 201 dossiers

exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-

ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates

& master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing

of a 201 clossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISC. 201 dossiers may be

opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this

handbook,

when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on

persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-

sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those i

persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals

are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff:

employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

CHAPTER III, ANNEX B

15 November 1974

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO |

records system and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-

ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose

names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2. 201

dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-

proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested

for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than

denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(5) Persons on whom a Main Inder search reveals information in five

or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/

ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting

a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-

tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the

master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-

ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample

201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field

station may request the opening of a 201. file by writing 201- in the Head-

quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after the

subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening

is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by

placing 201- after the term "File" on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN

will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-

bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of

201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

a name trace or other process, i.e., review of predecessor documents, it must

be consolidated into his personality dossier. See DOI 70-20 for consolidation

procedures.

Material which is filed in the dossier includes but is not limited to:

2. 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831).

b. Biographic information including photographs, fingerprints, and

handwriting samples.

c. Personal Record Questionnaire Parts I and II.

d. Operational and other security approvals.

e. Name check replies, requests, clearances, and approvals.

a Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires

discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the

simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take

place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done

periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should

be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, Le., exact copy (s) of a document.

(2) Name trace form (Form 382) unless it has been the basis for

the opening.

(3) All abstract slips.

(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch

cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information

contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is

by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier

forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention

in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized

officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction

over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification

authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained

at the desk or the copy of the IS document should be removed, retained

in & desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a

cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the location

of the TS document.

(9) Deferred documents (see 5b(2)).

b. Maintenance Procedures

(1) All material in a 201 dossier will be filed in document date order.

In the case of document attachments which have been classified into a 201

number, the attachment will be filed by the date of the basic document.

(2) Deferred documents will not be filed in a 201 dossier. If they are

to be retained in the dossier they should be sent to IP/RMS for classification

into that 201.

(3) Field index cards (held by some-desks) and area desk cards may

be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards

should be mounted on a full-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201.

(4) A 201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff

employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to

the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be

closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it

(5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true

name 201 if one exists or converted to the true name.

(6) Field and duplicate (shadow) 201 files no longer of active interest

should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material

has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified

to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IP/AN).

(7) Any document with a predecessor organization cover sheet or an

OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archives and

Disposition Section (IP/ARD) must be returned to IP/ARD for processing

to the 201.

(8) Desk memoranda (with or without a document source number)

containing substantive or derogatory information on the subject of the 201

should be sent to. IP/AN to be classified officially into the 201 file.

(9) An attachment which should be separated from its basic document

for inclusion in a 201 personality dossier will be forwarded with the basic

document to IP/AN for processing into the 201.

(10) To retain the P&L, RYBAT, or KAPOK sensitivity of a document

remaining in a 201 dossier being retired to Central Files, place that document

in an envelope sealed with black tape (see DOI 70-17). Any RYBAT, P&eL,

ur KAPOK document sent to Central Files not in a black-taped envelope willl

automatically be handled as desensitized. A black-taped envelope may con-

tain only one document and must be filed in chronological order within the

File. If there are numerous documents of this type the desk officer may black®

tape the entire dossier rather than individual documents (see DOI 70-10).

CHAPTER III, ANNEX B

15 November 1974

All standard listings are cumulative; previous editions must. be destroyed

upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely

sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

b. Non-Standard Listings

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

(1) Country of location

(2) O1 codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation)

(3) Citizenship

(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years )

(5) Occupation.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

OI code of XX or codes of XX; XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who sere born in Germany between the years 1915

and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the Ol code Art.

Note however that the listing would cuntain only those personalities svith an

Ol code AA: Those personalities with an OI code other than Ad and those

with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specitic

as the occupation code (Attachment L). The occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice

some trade or manual occupation, ie., carpenters; bricklayers, painters, mechanics

and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this categor!

will be included in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted

(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:

(a) Surname

(b) Given name

(e) Date of birth

(d) Country of birth

(e) Citizenship

(5) Ol code

(g) Location

ANNEX B

?.:

PERSONALITIES - 201 AND IN NUMBERS

• %:

!:I. A relatively small proportion of the total number of personall-

des indexed by the cs are of active operational interest at any given

point in time. These are normally, subjects of extensive reporting and

cl invesugation, prospective agents and sources, and members ot

groups and organizations of continuing target interest. Each of these

personalities is assigned either a 201 number or an IDN number.

2. The 201 number serves a dual purpose. It brings the files on

these personalities into the CS records system. A single number,

by 201-123 5 1, les tablished to each geran, on a oster coreoled

to it, all of the reporting on the individual's personal history, current

status and prospects. Once the 201 number is assigned, it is used in

future reporting on the individnal both as a file number and in place of

other identifying data.. Up-to date machine listings are published

periodically to help field stations and headquarters desks keep book

on those 201 personalities falling in their particular geographic or

• functional area of interest.

: i.

3. It has become apparent that the 201 machine listings should in-

lude the identities of persons of operational interest because of then

connection with i target group or organization even though there mai

not be sufficient information or specific interest to warrant opening

-alle. For osample: A considerable number of stations are concerned

• with the activities of Cuban exiles. Coverage of their movements, :

; factions and objectives can be assisted by furnishing all participating

stations up-to-date listings containing information under the control:

of the Cuban desk on the dramatis personae. In addition to 201 per -

sonalities, such lists should contain the names and identitying data

of persons who should be kept track of, although they may only be o

tangential interest or on whom there may be little or no data other

than that given in the listing itself:

4. To accommodate this type of requirement in the 201 system,

identifiable personalities concerning whom enough information is not

yet avallable to require the opening of a file may be assigned numbers

of the following type but in the same series:

IDN -123457

These are relabeled "201" Il a lie is opened. IN numbers are car-

ried with a numbers in appropriate general or special sangs,

where they are identified by the letter "I" in the "Type of Name" col-

• umn. IDN numbers are not es file numbers.

• 5. All 201 code numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters,

either upon receipt of Form 831, or of a field dispatch. I a dispatch

is written about a personality not yet in the system, a 201 number for

It may be requested simply by writing under headquarters file number

in the dispatch form as follows:

6. IDN numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters upon the •

request of stations or desks which are developing special identification

programs within the 201 system. The field receives current notifica-

tion of new 201 openings and IDN numbers through the Field Index Card

Service.
