MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

VIA 3: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT : Mr. Robert A. Maheu
REFERENCE : C/CCS memorandum, same subject, dated
17 March 1971
1. After further consideration of the problems posed
the Mr. Robert A. Maheu by Intertel and
03 association with that company for

cover, I would Tike to recommend that a somewhat fuller
briefing be given to Mr. Mullin than originally envisioned
in my memorandum of 17 March. It seems clear to us that an
investigation of Mr. Robert A. Maheu's activities in Quito,
as contemplated by Mr. Mullin, will reveal that:

a. Mr. Ja Duran, an Equadorian “
percenter-type" (who worked closely with of
in b is hostile to Robert A. Maheu Associates |
because n believes himself to have been badly
treated by Robert A. Maheu Associates on a cable TV

project in which he shared an interest.

b, The sum of $10,000 was deposited in the

First National City Bank of Quito by Maheu as a
kind of \"earnest" money (prior tol man ah 4
arrival.) This money was to ass 5

the continuing. interest of Robert A. Maheu Associ-
ates in the cable TV roiect._ On, the day of his
departure from Quito, withdrew the
$10.000 in local currency

ee (This transaction
Was aT tHe Fequest of] jand thq

_ ~— SEGRET

__| It is importkarto note Mr. Duran can be
“expected to comment in some adverse way on this
subject, Moreover, we have no positive knowl-

edge if this money was originally Mr. Maheu's,

Mr. Hughes', or some combination thereof.

3. We believe that mr. Mullin should be given a more

complete briefing on the relationship betwee:
Robert A, eB as it pertains to
includt: current status as an’

CIA. We will encourage Rn to handle
any information he develops about with greater
discretion. Moreover, should the ute 6: « Mullin's

investigation present him with a conflict between the
interests of his employer and CIA, Mr. Mullin may be in a
better position to recognize that conflict and consult with
us before either disclosing the information or pursuing a
matter of potential embarrassment to CIA.

4. Officers in this organization who know and have
dealt with Mr. Mullin vouch for the honesty of Mr. Mullin's
willingness to do what he can to prevent unnecessary
exposure of CIA's interests. Although he has been described
by Agency staffers who know him as “not a mental giant,"
they believe he will cooperate even to the extent of advising
us of the results of his investigations where our vital
interests may be concerned, It should also be considered
that Mr. Maheu is currently under investigation in Las Vegas
and we have no way of knowing what connection with CIA may
be disclosed by a search of Robert A. Maheu Associates’ files.

5. It is my proposal, after consultation with
Mr. James P, O'Connell, DD/PTOS, that Mr. Mullin be briefed
on the cover relationship between Robert A. Maheu Associates



airy

and and role in the removal of
the 7 the a 24 The briefing would be
done by Mr. O'Connell and 2 member of my staff. Naturally,
nothing of an operational nature will be revealed to

Mr. Mullin.
