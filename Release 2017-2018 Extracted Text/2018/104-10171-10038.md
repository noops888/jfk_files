school group and pass. unnoticed in small or large cities.

Ne organized Action Sabotage’ teams: in the provinces with the

aid of Hans HENGLER, National Milit/ary Coordinator, who has since been|
arrested and reportedly undergoing torture in the headquarters of G-2

in Mira:

(Organization and Operations. of these teams are the sub-

ject of following dispatch.) FARINAS described their supplies as

depleted.

and outdated. He ited one example in which their fragmenta-

tion grenades ‘are date#1952 and during the beach aétion in Pinar del
Rio when “Juanin" (PEREIRA). was: captured and shot, many of the grenades

did. not explode.

‘Subject. laid the total failure of their defensive

operation to thé grenade failures since they were attacKed. by numbers

“of militia. who did not feé1 cover and“precautions were necessary after

thoy observed the first grenade failure.

“8.

They were also ‘having trouble with the last of their small

stock of "time pencils” (Firing Device, demolition, M1), Subject,
using a lead pencil, demonstrated how they tested the safety device
at last minute just before inserting the pencil in thé. shape charge.
‘In Some peiicils the firing pins were faulty and were discarded.

blasting caps and.small arms for personal defense.

Their most Scrious shortages at present are time pencils,
He described some

teams as working. in. cities and having old Springfield rifles as their

only weapon.

This was pointed out as a.double security hazard. since it

» could not be concéaled by the. carrier on.an. operation and it jeopardize
their safchouses by' its difficult. concealment. :

7._ FARINAS described their stock of explosives upon his departure]

as total

of about 120 lbs ‘throughout the Island, and much of this was

the inferior C-3 type, .It is distributed roughly as follows: 60 1bs
in Havana, 25 lbs in Matanzas, 25 lbs in Camaguey, 10 Jbs in Oriente
with none in Pinar del Rio and Las Villas.’ Subject emphasized the
importance of shipping ‘only the C-4 type which is more. powerful and
safer to handle because it. is odorless and does not leave the. y8llow

stain that C-3 does.

“8,

When queried as to where subject received his training with

demolitions he replied that his predecessor had passed on the hasic
precautions, but since then they-trained the provincial teams by taking]
the U.S. War Department Demolitions manual and.with the aid of HENGLER*
English language capabilities, translated sections and reproduced copie|
in Spanish for distribution to the outlying. provincial teams.

a, DRE teams destroyed the Internatioial Harvester Plant with
“White Phosphorous” incendiary charges. :

10. Concerning PW activities, FARINAS explained that ‘he :seldom
had an opportunity. to.participate, but ‘that he was aware of the dis-
tribution of ‘the DRE organ, “Trinchera". These issues come out spora-
dically, about 10 to 15,000 per issuc for Havana and Havana Province.
Only a few copies are carried out to the provinces and they are fre-
quently reproduced locally. The two largest and most. popular issues we
those khown as “Alberto MULLER" (DRE Secretary. General ‘currently
imprisoned ‘at Boniato Prison in Oriente) and the “Juanin" issue

" (dedicated to Juanin PEREIRA; sha by. firing squad).

ll. “While subject ‘cannot return ‘for clandestine operations: at
thi: e, his experienceand: capabilities are such that,Should ‘be
given further training and considered for future. operations of guerril]]
warfare or civic resistance nature. Meanwhile, subject’ is preparing.
detailed.reports of provincial operations and he will probably be
consulted on future Clandestine operations planned by JMWAVE..
