He described some

teams as working in cities and having old Springfield rifles as their

only weapon.

This was pointed out as a double security hazard since it

could not be concealed by the carrier on an operation and it jeopardized

their safchouses by its difficult. concealment.

FARINAS described their stock of explosives upon his departure

as total of about 120 lbs throughout the Island,

much of this was

the infcrior C-3 type:

It is distributed roughly as follows:

in lavana, 25 lbs in Matanzas, 25 lbs in Camaguey, 10 Ibs in

in Pinar del Rio and Las Villas.

Subject emphasized the

importance of shipping only the C-1 type which is more powerful and

safer to handle because it is odorless and does not leave the yellow

stain that C-3 does:

When queried as to where subject received his training with

demolitions he replied that his predecessor had passed on the basic

precautions, but since then they trained the provincial teams by taking

the U.S. War Department Demolitions manual and with the aid of HENGLER's

English

languagc capabilities, translated sections and reproduced copie

in Spanish for distribution to the outlying provincial teams.

Subject recalled the following operations during his period:

DRE teams destroyed the International Harvester Plant with

"White' Phosphorous" incendiary charges.

Meanwhile, subject is preparing

detailed reports of provincial operations and he sill probably be
