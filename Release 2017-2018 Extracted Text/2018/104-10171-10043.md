On the opening day of the festival, as delegatione paraded through

the streeta to

the stadius,

five DRE delegates unfurled a banner. ID. tropE.

of the Cuban delegation demanding that Castro free bis thousands of polit

Ical prisoners.

(Reports vary on the actual text of the banner.) The

Cuban delegation broke ranks from the parade and attacked the DRE memberg,

pushing them backward into a crowd of Finnish spectators.

The Finns rallied

to the ald of the DRE members. and a General Melee followed, much to the

later embarrassment of the Cuban delegation and the festival sponsore.

This Incident was unrelated to the Pinnish rioting tbat followed

for three days after the festival opened. Sut It 13 lIkely that the 10-

cident helped to exacerbate the anti-communiat tension that caused tbe

rioting. Apparently with this view, Finnish police pieked up two of the

DRa mambers and questioned tben.: After releasing them, the police sought

the tro again..

Unfortunstely, the tvo DRe members happened to be riding

in a car that collided with a

police car on. the night of 1 August.. The

two vere. Jelled overnight and released the next day with the auggestion

that they leave Finland as soon as they could. Accordingly, the shole DRE

delegation left on 2 Auguat to 50.t0 Germany to attend a Christian Demo-

cratic youth meting.
