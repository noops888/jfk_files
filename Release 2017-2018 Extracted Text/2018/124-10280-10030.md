It is noted that CUBELA is a Cuban Government

official whose desire to defect was made known by MM 761-S

in June,

1962. Thereafter, CIA apparently made contact

with CUBELA in Europe through|CARLOS IEPEDINO, 9819 64th

Avenue, Rego Park, Queens, New York, a Cuban exile and 134

long-time friend of MM 761-S, who frequently travels in

Europe?

MM 761-S advised that on July 15, 1964, he was

visited by CARLOS TEPEDINO, at which time he confided (

certain information concerning CUBELA.

He cautioned

informant to say nothing concerning their conversation

which would permit the information to reach CIA or any

other source through which it might become public, inas-

much as to do so might result in the death of persons in

Cuba, as well as

TEPEDINO himself.

effective action in Cuba. lectEading to fEEDINO,

Acconding to TEPEDINO, CUBELA (O

desires some sort of compact equipment with which he can

possibly eliminate CASTRO; however, CIA keeps offering

him only large, bulky, unserviceable material.

Iccording to TEPEDINO, there is now under discussion u

some plan to kill FIDEL CASTRO

in which CUBELA will figure.

CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however,

inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no

part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been

brought up again for consideration.

President JOHNSON

allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it.

It set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime

before the elections in November.

TEPEDINO told the informant he has not been able fuj

to learn much more concerning this plan, other than that

CUBELA is supposed to participate, that it is to be

accomplished by men in Cuba, and

possibly someone from

Europe.

The informant advised TEPEDINO did not specificalle

indicate how he had acquired this information; however, the

(u)

informant presumed from his manner of speaking that he had

obtained it from CUBELA.

The above is for the information of the Bureau,

and is not being submitted in form suitable for dissemination.

since both TEPEDINO and CUBELA are apparently of operational

interest to CIA.

Dissemination would also lead to the

disclosure of MM 761-S. Although questioned closely,

MM 761-S was not able to furnish any further details.
