Miami Regional Office inform me if and when the trial was

security Officer, Ms?r

SE/X/LA, and MI. Robert Blandford, cos,ocS,

to Headquarters on 11 January 1977. I also forwarded Reference

A copies to Office of Security, External Activities Branch

On 28 February 1977 I was contacted by SA Robert

Fredericks of the DEA Miami Regional Office and informed that

the Hemming trial was scheduled to begin 2 March 1977.

Fredericks asked me to be on standby to travel to Miami to

appear as

on behalf of the United States Government.
