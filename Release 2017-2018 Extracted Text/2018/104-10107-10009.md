B. USA v. Gerald P. Hemming, Et Al.
(76+371-CR-CA)

1. As reported in Paragraph 4 of Reference A, the trial
of Gerald P. Hemming (Reference B) was severed on 10 January
1977. I was informed of the severance during my pre-trial
conference with AUSA Karen Atkinson in Miami, Florida on that
same day. AUSA Atkinson told me I could return to Washington,
D.C. and she would have the Drug Enforcement Administration
Miami Regional Office inform me if and when the trial was
rescheduled. I orally reported the above to Mr. Billy Hix,

SE Division Security Officer, Ms Acting Chief
SE/X/LA, and Mr. Robert Blandford, > > upon my return

to Headquarters on 11 January 1977. I also forwarded Reference
A copies to Office of Security, External Activities Branch

and the Office of General Counsel, Mr. Edmund Cohen.

2. On 28 February 1977 I was contacted by SA Robert :
Fredericks of the DEA Miami Regional Office and informed that
the Hemming trial was scheduled to begin 2 March 1977. SA
Fredericks asked me to be on standby to travel to Miami to
appear as a witness on behalf of the United States Government.
SA Fredericks said it was not certain the trial would begin



on 2 March and he did not know whether I would be needed
as a witness.

3. -I requested that SA Fredericks initiate action to
authorize me to travel to Miami via GTR issued by DEA,
SA Fredericks said he would initiate that action. I am
awaiting further notice from SA Fredericks.
