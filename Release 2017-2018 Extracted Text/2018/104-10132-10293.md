gher file number than the rest of the OSWALD holdings.
He could not remember the name which appeared on the outside
of the file but thought that it may have been one of OSWALD's
akas. He further related that he looked inside the file and
believed that it was related to, or possibly identical with,
the regular OSWALD holdings. While attempting to refile this
covert file, he observed that all of the regular OSWALD
holdings were permanently charged to the Security Analysis
Group; thus he believes he sent the covert file to the
Security Analysis Group.
