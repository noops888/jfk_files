described this file as covert, thin, and having a

higher file number than the rest of

He could not remember the name which appeared on the outside

akas. He further related that he looked inside the file and

believed that it was related to, or possibly identical

the regular OSWALD holdings. While attempting to refile this

covert file, he observed that all of the regular OSWALD

holdings were permanently charged to the Security Analysis

Group; thus he

believes he sent the covert file to the
