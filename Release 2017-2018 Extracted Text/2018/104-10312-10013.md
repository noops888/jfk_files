some way with Senator Robert Kennedy,- (Comment: The reference
may have been to Walter Sheridan, who served as an investigator
for Robert Kennedy when the latter was Attorney General.)

assistant DA for Garrison), a fnu Roper (no prior record in thie
context), and William Turner (a staff writer for Ramparts who has
been closely associated with Garrison and hie investigation}. Novel
also told Misa that he has a penetration of Garrison's
office. (Comment: He has made this claim earlier.) Through the
penetration he learned that he was to appear prominently in a
Ramparts article which would list him as a client of|

[—s—=Séind would also ifet as a cover or
front for CIA operations dealing with Internal (i.e., domestic)
affairs. Novel told Mise not to be concerned because he

had sent word back to Garrison that if such an article appeared,

Jwould sue. He later learned that the idea of
publi h an article had been dropped. He told this story to

Marilley had the impression, however, that Novel himself did not
believe the allegation about her firm and CIA.

12, Miss said that she believed that she could obtain
additional information about Novel by writing to a friend of hers,
Mr. Aaron M. Kohn, who ie the managing director of the
Metropolitan Crime Commission in New Orleans. She asked whether
there was any objection to her doing s0. She was told that there
was no objection as long as her inquiry was couched within the
frame of reference of-her own business and had nothing to do with
CIA. She then penned a note to-Mr. Kohn, inquiring about Novel
as a customer of her service and read it aloud. She was aseured
that there was no objection. She added that Mr. Kohn had done fine
jobs of cleaning up firet Denver, then New Orleans. (Comment:

‘ Kohn is a firm antagonist of Garrison.) Miss cautioned

that she may not get a reply for several weeks. é will give CIA
any information about Novel that Kohn may provide.

13. Novel's motives remain obscure. As was reported earlier,
there is a clear poesibility that he remained an ally of Garrison
after their seeming antagonism developed. If so, his efforts to link
himself publicly with CIA could be part of Garrison's attack upon
the Agency. This theory would also explain Novel's relationship toa
Garrison crony like Willard Robertson. Another posoibility is that
the feud is genuine. (Novel has made very strong accusations against
Garrison in major radio broadcasts; these include charges of
eccasional homosexuality and possible direct involvement in the
alleged murder of David Ferrie.) Mis ormed a clear
impression that Novel's dislike of Garr: ine. If so, his
persistent attempts to link himself to CIA may be part of a campaign
to create for International Dynamics Corporation an aura of prestige
as a result of suppose: vernment. He Heted the
U.S. government with 8 one of his clients. His
relationship to Willard Robertson might then be explained by his
repeated assertion that he has a penctration in Garrison's entourage.
