**Kenneth Brooten:** [00:00:00] Uh, with respect to the typing of this, would you describe very briefly for me the type of portable typewriter that you used? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Well, if it was mainly if, if I was using my personal portable typewriter, it. A royal typewriter and it is, uh, and he is on a sort of a brownish, beige case.

**Kenneth Brooten:** Alright ma'am. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** And if it was a typewriter that was issued by the, uh, comp, uh, company, then I don't remember whether

**Boris Tarasoff:** it was, it was standard 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Standard, then it would be on that.

Alright. But most of time we would have breakage of tape recorder and typewriter. So we'd have to improvise every now and then. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Now, did you get, I know you don't want to reveal the one [00:01:00] name, but did you, was the person who picked up the Oswald tape the same person that you received the tape from? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Nine times out of ten yes.

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yes. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Alright. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Most likely. Alright. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Okay. Um,

with respect to CIA personnel within the embassy, I'm talking about subsequent to the assassination of President Kennedy. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Mm-hmm. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Did. Any person from the CIA ever contact either of you about that particular tape or your transcription of the Oswald tape at any time? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I think my answer, [00:02:00] answer should have been negative. But, uh, with qualifying, uh, statement, do you remember if, uh, uh, her. About 

**Ann Tarasoff:** About a recall on the tape? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** No, not recall, but I mean about the whole business? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I don't think so. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No. In fact, I think, well, I don't think Herb might have, I don't think Herb was there then. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** You think you heard of [unintelligible] 

**Ann Tarasoff:** yeah. I don't think he was there then, because shortly after we came, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** he was from the first, because I had dealing the [unintelligible] I came. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yes. But the thing is that shortly after that he was transferred.

**Boris Tarasoff:** He was, he was actually there for quite a while.

**Ann Tarasoff:** The time went by. But anyway, no, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** we were to his house. Shortly after I came because I, [00:03:00] I said that the, the lord that they put on me is tremendous. I just cannot do it. Not humanly possible. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** So they, he said, don't worry about, they help the Spanish transcribers to the Spanish part again. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Now, did anyone from any agency of the federal government from the Warren Commission or anyone else talk to you or discuss with you your translation of Oswald Tape or your transcription of the Oswald Tape? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** It is negative. Absolutely no one. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** In 13 years, no one has talked to you. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Not even the embassy employee, the official, or the officials at that time that were our employers approached us on the subject.[00:04:00] 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Now ma'am, I just need some more information from you just for purposes of identification. Uh, your full name 

**Ann Tarasoff:** is Anna Tarasoff 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** and your address.

**Ann Tarasoff:** [unintelligible] Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** And your date of birth? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** May 5th, 1923. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** And your social security number, if you remember it? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No, I don't. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** All right. And what is your occupation or profession now? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Right now I'm just a housewife. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright. And are you. Retired from any agency of the federal government or, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** well, I am semi-retired, I should say.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright, from which agency ma'am? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** CIA. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright, and how long did you work for the CIA? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Oh, I was employed, uh, as of April, 1957. And then, uh. I was picked up. [00:05:00] Well, and then actually I had about a year's, uh, of off duty when we were transferred to Mexico City, and then I was picked up on contract and from, I would say from 64, uh, up until 1970. And that was my length of, uh, in duty with the CIA. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Now, did you know in the embassy or did you ever have contacts? I'm gonna ask you about a number of or about some names with Anne Goodpasture. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** I know Anne Goodpasture, but I didn't have any dealings with her. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Did Anne Goodpasture ever bring tapes back and forth? As a courier type of a person and pick up transcripts and stuff to your recollection. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Anne, I think Anne did it once when Charlie or some something [00:06:00] went wrong or, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** yes, I, I, think, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** I think she brought it by once, if I'm not mistaken. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** But were, as far as you know, or as far as you may remember,

**Ann Tarasoff:** that wasn't her duty because 

**Kenneth Brooten:** that wasn't her job. Alright. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** It was just sort of a fill in. If there was for any, some reason or other. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** What about a Clark Anderson? Did you know Clark Anderson? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I knew 

**Kenneth Brooten:** in the embassy,

**Boris Tarasoff:** I, I, I'm not sure about his first name, but I knew Mr. Anderson. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** And was he the legal attache? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I I met him when, when I was there on Du I, 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Alright. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** We had, uh, a [unintelligible] at his home and we talked about the furniture that he made.

**Kenneth Brooten:** Alright, that's. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I can tell you about that's the same person, but his name was family name was Anderson, whether he was Clark or somebody else I don't know. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** What about a Mr. Phillips? Did you know, did you know Mr. Phillips on the Cuban desk? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** [00:07:00] No, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** this, 

**Kenneth Brooten:** alright. Did you, did you know Mr. And Mrs. Manell 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Mannell, sir? Yes. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yes.

**Kenneth Brooten:** Alright. And did. How closely did you work from 1963 until 1970. How closely did you work and associate with people from the embassy? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, it 

**Kenneth Brooten:** directly worked, with them 

**Boris Tarasoff:** on, you mean deal dealing in official capacity? 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Yes. Yes. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I don't think we, we ever attempted anything like that. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Alright. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Just socially sometimes they had, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** that was rarely.

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yeah, it was 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Because they were skeptical, very cagey about having us 

**Boris Tarasoff:** so. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Being seen with them and vice versa. So I don't know. It was the chief's idea that we shouldn't be socializing with the inside people. See, since we were on the outside [00:08:00] for some, for some reason, I don't know. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** I see. What, did you have any particular type of cover or anything? How did you appear to your, what did it appear to your friends and associates that you were doing in Mexico City? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Well, most of our friends and associates were CIA people anyway. So if you were sitting overseas, you didn't have to tell 'em. They more or less could get on your own. We were 

**Boris Tarasoff:** talking about company, uh, well, I, I'm giving out a, a very deep, and sinister secret we'll always refer to the company as Pickle Factory. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yeah the PF 

**Boris Tarasoff:** now letters to each other put down PF and then.

**Kenneth Brooten:** Did you ever see any, did either of you [00:09:00] ever see any transcripts of any tapes from Spanish involving Oswald 

**Boris Tarasoff:** from Spanish? Did she, she used to read the whole thing of see if. Where you, did you explain your function, what you have to pay for? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No. He started to ask me, but I didn't finish. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** I want 

**Ann Tarasoff:** to, you had to change 

**Kenneth Brooten:** I want to go into some of your, some of your functions when you came to Mexico.

**Ann Tarasoff:** When I first came to Mexico, first few months, I, I was told I could help Boris because there was such a backlog of work that was left on his, uh, shoulders when his, uh, predecessor left. And so, uh, since I was employed with CIA, there was no way for me, no reason for them not to say yes because they didn't have to worry about a clearance.

So I was helping him out with the filing and, [00:10:00] uh, more or less putting it in category. Uh, well, I think it's in order, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** it, it is very important the, the part that she played in it, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** because I filed, according to the date of the re and the reel itself had a number. And then following that, each conversation had a number and, uh.

I would, that would be the original copy that I would file as it is in whole. Then the carbon copy would be also, uh, kept in its original state and the second one I would sort of scan it over and just delete what was not. Pertinent, like it was a conversation of somebody saying, well, tomorrow I'm going downtown.

Do you wanna go with me? I'll pick you up at such and such time. Or I'm having lunch with them, or it's a phone call and they say, no one's here and hangs up. But if it had [00:11:00] anything to deal with two people, and especially if their names were mentioned, this was cut out and it was pasted on a piece of paper, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** white paper I guess, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** and it was turned into our contact. Well, in the morning was handed to the same person that delivered and it was delivered then to the, uh, people at the embassy and from there, I, they, I guess they filed it according to their own system. But, uh, they, at first they wanted everything and then they found out why they were a million times somebody's dying for the time, somebody's dying to find out where their husband's come in.

And then, so they said, this is just a waste of time. Try to, uh, trying to file all this. What we're looking for is people that are during conversation, uh, with each other, and especially if they're identifying one another. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** No, actually it was not to your discretion. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yes. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** To throw out the unnecessary 

**Ann Tarasoff:** All the others.

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yeah, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** because they didn't, [00:12:00] they were trying to do this at the embassy and then they found that it was taking up too much of their time for work. Uh, it is more pertinent than just sitting there and cutting. Little pieces of paper. So they decided that it would be up to me to use my, uh, common sense and see what was pertinent and what wasn't pertinent.

And uh, and just as they say, put it on a sheet of paper and they, in turn, I guess, filed it. And if they had comments to make on it, they would make their own personal comments. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** But on these tapes, you didn't. Some things that you did, you didn't put your own, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** no 

**Kenneth Brooten:** personal mm-hmm. Comments on that? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** There was no, uh, comment made of on my part.

**Kenneth Brooten:** Well, I believe that that is all the questions I have for right now. My colleague has prepared some questions, and, relating to scenarios that I haven't covered, and so I'm going shut the tapes off and we'll. [00:13:00] I come around to this. I'm good. Alright. Alright. Now identify yourself, John. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright. My name is Jonathan Blackmer. I'm, uh, counsel with the Select Committee on Assassinations. Um, Mr. Tarasoff, I'm going to ask you a few questions concerning, um, specifics of your function in Mexico City in 1963 between the periods of September and November. Uh, I understand from your answers to Mr. Brooten's questions that your responsibility was to translate and and transcribe intercepts of telephone conversations coming into the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** and from the Soviet Embassy 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** coming in and going out of the Soviet embassy.

Uh, during the course of, uh, your employment, did you become familiar with many of the voices of the people? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Oh, yes. You gradually begin to. You realize who they are the way they talk, and [00:14:00] you yourself very closely with them after a while, but it takes time. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Uh, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** unfortunately, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** uh, is not a fact that, uh, these Russians, uh, were very cautious when they spoke on the telephone.

**Boris Tarasoff:** Oh, yes, definitely. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Did they, they didn't usually identify themselves by name. No, no, they didn't. So therefore, it was really necessary for you to become familiar so you could, you could place them, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** unless of course a certain person asks the, whoever. That individual to whoever he might be. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** And then you, then the name would come up and you'd be what?

**Boris Tarasoff:** Uh, I don't think it happen to any of you.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright, sir. Um, can I ask you if you, if there were any particular individuals that you could instantly recognize their voices? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, Yakinov was one of them. Then they had Eukenrikov. Oh it's a riot. [00:15:00] I tell you. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** So you, uh, you recognize instantly certain voices of individuals and, uh, I see that you have a scrapbook in front of us and in that it's got, uh, it seems to be photographs of people, uh, on the Soviet delegation here in Mexico City. Is that 

**Boris Tarasoff:** delegation?

**Jonathan Blackmer:** The Soviet Embassy Embassy in Mexico City.

Uh, you have, uh, various names and there are different sections. So you, you stayed on top of who these people were and where they were in the embassy.

**Boris Tarasoff:** What I could scrounge out, because I asked, uh, I asked for the photographs. I said, how, how am I going tell who is who if I don't see what the heck he looks like?

And Herb told me, he said, can. Work without pictures, it says, and give me a report of them about what you think of which one of them. And the first one apparently was so successful. It was jumping with joy. I described, but uh, I kind of [00:16:00] see it a little bit so that I saw the picture of the person I was describing.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** All right sir, so they kept you in the dark, and you made clippings from newspapers, and you got various photographs. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Later they relented and let me see the pictures. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright, let, let me move into one, one specific area. Uh, are you familiar with a one, uh, Pavel Antonovich Yatskov? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yatskov. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you, do you know this individual well? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yes, and we have his pictures. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** You have his picture, and do you recall having transcribed, uh, telephone conversations in which Mr. Yatskov was, uh, one of the people on telephone. So you would recognize his voice?

**Boris Tarasoff:** I imagine I would, but, uh, uh, as I said before, I, I'm not, I'm not sure about anything right now. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Well, so many years. But back then, um, constantly doing these transcription, you made many phone calls, you explained to me that [00:17:00] let me ask you if this is correct. Someone speaking Russian sounds a certain way and the same person speaking English might not sound the same.is that correct?

**Boris Tarasoff:** That's correct. That's correct because the person who speaks English uses very stilted language and low pauses between two words and it sounds mechanical to me.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** This is a Russian speaking English? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yes, sir. Russian speaking English. You see? 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright. And you, uh, I understand that from reviewing the Oswald tape 

**Boris Tarasoff:** mm-hmm. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** When you were transcribing the two telephone conversations, do you have an opinion right now as to whether Yatskov was one of the, was the party that Mr. Oswald had, was speaking to on those two occasions? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I doubt it very much because by, comparing pictures, I would say that it is not the same person. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Uh, but uh, did you, had you ever heard Yatskov speaking English? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** That I cannot answer. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Were you [00:18:00] aware that he could speak English? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** That I don't know. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** You don't know, but you did recall many conversation from Yatskov in, in Russian?

**Boris Tarasoff:** Oh, yes, yes. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright. Um, do you, um. Believe that you said, you stated that you, you, you doubt very seriously Yatskov was one of the 

**Boris Tarasoff:** mm-hmm. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Parties speaking. Now, I ask you if, uh, if you are familiar with a a Kostikov? Valeriy... 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you know, uh, know Mr. Kostikov? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I had transcribed some of his, uh, calls 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** before, uh, before the Oswald calls.

**Boris Tarasoff:** Most likely. Most likely. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** So you are familiar with Mr. Kostikov's voice speaking Russian. Is that, is that true? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, that is, if I remember it correctly. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Can you tell me whether or not you would ever recall Mr. Kostikov speaking in English? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** No. [00:19:00] If, if a person was speaking in English, I doubt if I would know him. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Can you recall any conversation in which any of these high ranking Russians and you and you did, you did know their function? Did you know, were they secret police Yatskov and Kostikov?? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, eventually I got to know them. Who's who. I think I had that list of them. Say, remember 

**Ann Tarasoff:** You were given a list,

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yes, yes. 

Saying who's who 

**Ann Tarasoff:** of all the Soviet Embassy employees and 

**Boris Tarasoff:** mm-hmm. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Their status. As to whether they were secretary, treasurer, or the one at the gate answering the phone.

And, uh. But, and they also issued certain information if they were able to, to prove it, that they were suspect that they suspected KGB and suspected the operator that, that they had. So this list was furnished. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Could you tell me if you had this list before the Oswald conversation? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Oh, this list was furnished, uh, [00:20:00] practically every time they had a changeover of, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** mm-hmm. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Personnel. Personnel. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Did you know at the time of the Oswald conversation that Kostikov was a member of the KGB, 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I guess, but, uh, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** But uh, was this also indicated on this list that you got, whether they were KGB or not? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** If they suspected and they had proof. They would, uh, put in question mark.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you recall this man? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No. That I didn't know. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright, um, uh... 

**Boris Tarasoff:** You have to realize one thing. There were 15 employees plus their wives who decided on the form. So actually there, what a number of people to take care of. Uh, it was almost impossible to. Uh, realize who's who, unless you get to know their voices perfectly.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright. Uh, can I ask you if, uh, are you familiar with the, with a, a Antonovich 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Kanstantinov? 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** [00:21:00] Konstantinov? Do you know a Kanstantinov?

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, I heard them one day. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you know what position he had in the embassy? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Absolutely. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you recall whether he was suspected of being KGB official? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Yes, I, I was told that he was, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** you were told that he was KGB? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Confirmed.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Confirmed KGB was this, do you know when you found this out? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Pardon me? 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you know what period of time you found this out?

**Boris Tarasoff:** No. Can't say that. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Could you tell me, you don't know that it was before or after? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** No. Uh, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** The uh, Oswald phone call. Do you recall the name? Kostin, K-O-S-T-I-N?

**Boris Tarasoff:** Sounds sounds familiar, but. Again, let, let's say I doubt it. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Did you ever come across the name Kostin, Mrs. Tarasoff? They what? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Unless they 

**Ann Tarasoff:** abbreviated it. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Abbreviated it, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** well, you speak, you're fluent in Russian, sir. Is is, is that, does that look to you [00:22:00] like it could any way being abbreviation of either the name Kostikov, or Yatskov, or Konstantinov? Would someone familiar in the language of Russian use that as an abbreviation for any of those names?

**Boris Tarasoff:** I'm completely at a loss here, it. It, it sounds Russian enough but...

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you, do you know of any of the high ranking officials in the Soviet embassy, whether they spoke English on the telephone conversations or did they speak Russian mostly? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Oh, they spoke Russian. It's very seldom that you had English. Very seldom. And then they usually, I called upon her to verify my, uh, [00:23:00] idea or whatever they were talking about.

Sometimes the language was so bad that, uh, it was impossible to make heads or tails... 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** uh, I would like to ask you if you can state an opinion as to whether or not you think the party talking with Mr. Oswald on the two conversations that you intercepted were any of the individuals we've just discussed, Yatskov, Kostikov, Konstantinov, or Kostin?? Do you know for a fact whether Mr. Oswald spoke with any of these? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, uh, my unconfirmed guess would be that it was, must have been either Kostikov or Konstantinov

**Ann Tarasoff:** for that, for the simple reason. Out of the whole group that was at the embassy, there were only about two that really spoke English well enough. Well, they could carry on a conversation 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** and those two are? [00:24:00] 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Would be these two people. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Kostikov and Konstantinov? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Because the others were sort of like a beginner, you know, a word here and there, but they couldn't carry on a conversation.

In fact, if a phone call was made and the American was calling, trying to get some information, well even the party, the party at the gate that would be there. Or at the switchboard, they would hardly understand what they were trying to say. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Mmm-hmm. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** They would try to tell 'em in English or in Spanish that they don't understand them.

**Boris Tarasoff:** Mm-hmm. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Or telling them well in, in Russian or in Spanish. And they'd finally hang up because even the party at the switchboard, very seldom knew English. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** So, but you know, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** so you could boil it down to how many there were that really spoke English well enough where they could carry on the conversation.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright. Uh, I understand, um, that you had made, uh, voice tapes. [00:25:00] Uh, could you, could you describe to me what, what you did and, and why that was done? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, first of all, I wanted to familiarize myself with the way each member of the embassy was talking. Secondly, if I have the somebody doing my work for me after I transferred for any other reason, that they would listen to the voices of this, some employees and figure out who was talking.

And for, in order to build a, build up a library, let's say, of the, uh, voice prints. So consequently, uh, I had quite a number of these spools, spools from eight millimeter movies. I used those for, uh, cutting, cutting off a section off the tape, and then winding, get on a spool, and then my wife would [00:26:00] mark it and put a piece of paper identifying which voice, when it was spoken, etc.

And so. After a while we ran out of it because there were so many, so we had to go to the store and we go a whole mess on this. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Uh, did you, who, did you deal with anybody in the embassy on this voice taping? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** No, I, I, I sent a notice to that effect to the embassy would be a good idea. They didn't, so at first, but then remember, I think it was her that sent, actually sent voice samples.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** So you definitely communicated this to Herb Mannell? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I think so, that's who it was. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Can you tell me a little more about the voice identity tapes that you made, when you left the employemnt, did you turn them over to anyone in the Embassy?

**Boris Tarasoff:** Oh yes, we had a box full of them. Do you remember who took them?

**Ann Tarasoff:** Well, when we were leaving, all [00:27:00] the equipment went, there were a couple of them that came out and Charlie came out and, uh, who was the other fellow that came out with them and they took the one that brought the, uh, dictionaries for you? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Oh, Dan, Dan Vogel. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yeah, he took some of the stuff too. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** I'm sorry, could you, could you Who, who? Dan? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Vogel? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** His name was in that

**Jonathan Blackmer:** In, in what, sir? His name was in the, in the, in the book. The CIA Diary Dan Vogel was someone that you gave these voice identity tapes to? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Mm-hmm. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** I see. Do you know if these tapes are still in existence? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** That I have no idea 

**Boris Tarasoff:** to say. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Um, I'd like to show you a memorandum, sir. It's dated the 16th of October, 1963. It is a teletype message to the ambassador concerning Lee Harvey [00:28:00] Oswell's contact with the Soviet Union. I'd like to read for you this. And I wanna ask you if you think it's a fair representation of the information that you transmitted to CIA headquarters and, uh, during the time you, uh, transcribed the, the Oswald tape if we can. We have a minor delay if we can co-op just for a moment and make the return. Mrs. Mrs. Tarasoff Mr. Tarasoff, I was going to, uh, ask you, uh, give you the information that's contained in October 16th, 1963 CIA, a memo to the ambassador. It also has carbon copies to immigration naturalization, navy, legal attache, regional security officers, councilors, political affairs, and the ministry. This is information that was sent to these different agencies concerning Mr. Oswald's appearance in Mexico City in the in the period [00:29:00] September, October, 1965, and I'll just read it. And I'll try to emphasize the part that, uh, when they are discussing Mr.Oswald, uh, this memo starts, the following information was received, and of course, the source is blanked out on October 1st, 1963. Now, I want you, I want to read this following information. Tell me if you think there's anything more in the transcripts than what's contained in this message. An American male contacted the Soviet Embassy and ident... And identified himself as Lee Oswald.

Is that correct so far? Is that basically what you have the transcript? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yes 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** This officer determined that Oswald had been at the Soviet Embassy on 26th, the 28th of September, 1963, and had talked with Kostikov, a member of the consular section. Now, do you know for a fact whether he was at the Soviet Embassy? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** We could never know that 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** never knew that. And do you know for a fact whether he talked with Kostikov even on the telephone?

**Boris Tarasoff:** Well, [00:30:00] that's, as I said before, it's a very doubtful proposition and we can jump at conclusions. So we can, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** but you don't know is a fact that he did.

Alright. Mr. Oswald's contact was done in order to learn if the Soviet Embassy had to received a reply from Washington concerning his Oswald's request. Now, do you know if in the conversation intercept whether he was requesting something?

**Ann Tarasoff:** If I can remember, I think he was requesting, uh, financial help to go back to either go to Cuba or to go to Russia. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** You don't recall it being, uh, whether or not, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** but he needed financial assistance because he had didn't have much money. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you recall whether he asked the Soviet Embassy people if they had received replies [00:31:00] from some previous request he made?

**Ann Tarasoff:** No. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Um, that is, the information is there and there, so is there any more information that you know from the transcript about Mr. Oswald's telephone conversations? Is there more that's contained in that, in the paragraph I just read you? If so, what else did you, what else did you know? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Well, I couldn't really rely on the memory, but I know the conversation was quite lengthly.

In fact, uh, the transcript I think must have been at least a couple of pages or two and a half pages, but it had to be done verbatim, word for word. It wasn't just listening to it and then you making a summary. It was a verbatim transcript with, made of both parties speaking to each other. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Well, was there any more in the context of what went on that conversation other than the fact that he just wanted to know if, if he'd gotten a request [00:32:00] back from the Soviets, did he ask for anything?

Do you recall that he asked for anything? Did he ask for a visa? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** That I wouldn't swear to. But I know he was requesting financial help because he said he was just out of money. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** So that much is very clear. You do remember, he at least asked for financial help 

**Ann Tarasoff:** and he, and he wanted to speak to someone in the embassy who would be able to finance, I guess, give him the money.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Did he indicate that he wanted to leave Mexico? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Oh, definitely. He didn't wanna stay. Well, I know that he didn't wanna stay in Mexico because he was gonna leave one if he couldn't get, uh, results from one of the embassies, the Cuban or the, uh, Soviet Embassy. He wasn't about to stay in Mexico. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you know this from the transcript, or is this from some other knowledge that you gained since then?

**Ann Tarasoff:** I don't know whether that was in the transcript or whether it was something that came through another source. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Can I ask you if you can recall from the transcript, either one of you, [00:33:00] whether or not he said he wanted to go to Cuba or Russia, you said he wanted to get out of Mexico. Did the transcript, can you recall from the transcript did he indicate where he wanted to go? He wanted to leave Mexico? Where do he want to go? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** If any place he would go back to Russian because his wife is the Russian extraction. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Well, I, I, and 

**Ann Tarasoff:** and this is the one reason why I, it puzzled, puzzled both Boris and I. That although he married a Russian, why was he given, why was she given permission to leave the country when it's so difficult for others to leave?

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Uh, alright, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** so there must be some sort of, there must have been some sort of an angle. There. Well, he married us to a Russian girl and he lived there, I believe it was three or four years. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Let, let, let's, can we, uh, while we're on this, this record, let's, uh, we want get an opinion, speculation. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yeah. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** I want to get anything that you can recall having seen on that transcript that indicated where he wanted to go. [00:34:00] You say he wanted financial aid, that he was broke, did it indicate where he wanted to go? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** He really didn't care. He wanted to go either to Cuba or Russia. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you know that from the transcript? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** I would say that's exactly what he would say. If I could rely on my memory. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** In your memory of what was in the transcript. That he wanted to go to Cuba or Russia. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** He wasn't, he didn't wanna stay in Mexico's for sure. His purpose of coming to Mexico was to contact either one of the embassies because he couldn't get any results In Washington. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Yes, ma'am. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** From the embassy. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** So, uh, now this is, we want to stay only with the knowledge that you have based on what you transcribed. And you think that you transcribed something that indicated that he wanted to leave Mexico City and travel to Cuba or Russia? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** That's right. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** And is that anywhere contained in this 16 October, 1963? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Well, as far as dates are concerned, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** You see the memo before you. Do you see anything in there that indicates where, that he, that he said he wanted to travel to Russia?

**Ann Tarasoff:** No. No. I,

**Jonathan Blackmer:** You see nothing in there do you, sir? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** [00:35:00] No it... 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** It clearly states.

**Boris Tarasoff:** I can't recollect.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** well, you have the memo in front of you, alright, well we will, we will see when we, if we can get that transcript. Well, I want, I want Thank you very much. I'll, uh, conclude my questioning. Uh, and, uh, Mr. Brooten will now, uh, conclude the remaining session.

**Kenneth Brooten:** Now I have given Mr. Tarasoff a receipt for that portable typewriter and you can 

**Ann Tarasoff:** back working order. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Just for the record, do I have your consent to, uh, to take that and to run into... 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yes, you certainly do. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** And as I explained to you at some future date, um, the select Committeeon Assassinations of the House of Representatives may request your presence to appear and testify, and would you be willing to appear and testify [00:36:00] before the Congress regarding the matters to which we have discussed today? That is your transcription of the telephone tape between Lee Harvey Oswald and Officials of the Soviet Embassy? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** I have no objection as long as it would be a closed session and not a public thing. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Alright. Okay. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** But you know, some of these are open to the public and everybody likes to sit in, in the conversation and then everybody draws their own conclusions. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** The KGB has got a stack of documents about me that high.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Kenneth, before you conclude, uh, there's one thing I did not go over with Mrs. Tarasoff, and I'll do that very briefly. Mrs. Tarasoff I want to show you a few photographs and tell me if you recognize that individual.

**Ann Tarasoff:** No

**Jonathan Blackmer:** I'm showing photographs taken from the, uh, publication Coup d'etat In America, these are photographs. I wonder if you could tell me if you recognize either one of those two. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** As far as, uh, the, uh, people are concerned, I wouldn't be able to recognize any of [00:37:00] them because I never was shown, uh, any photos 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** having been in Mexico City during this period of time. I was just wondering if maybe, if you'd seen any of these people?

**Ann Tarasoff:** Oh you mean just casually on the street? No.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Can I ask you if you know Howard Hunt? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Know Howard Hunt? Hunt? Is he... [unintelligible]

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you, do you recognize, I show you three photographs of Howard Hunt and I asked you if you recall having seen this man in Mexico City in 1963 when, when you first arrived, whether it be at the embassy or on the street or at a party. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** No, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** because as far as our, uh, contact with embassy was very limited.

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Can I also ask you if ever in transcribing any of these tapes in, in Russian, you ever heard the Russians discuss the fact that their embassy was broken into, or someone was attempting to burglarize their embassy? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** I can not answer that positively because I don't remember. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Very good. [00:38:00] Alright, that concludes my questioning. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Mr.and Msr. Tarasoff, I thank you very much for taking the time to, you have to discuss this both last night and tonight with us. And I would request on behalf of Richard Sprague, the chief counsel of the committee that you not discuss this. I can only make that as a request. Um, and if anyone should contact you, I would like to certainly know about it other than someone officially from our committee. And this concludes these interviews. 

No, we're going back on the record. Uh, for, for a brief question. Um, I understand that, uh you were the proceeded or rather succeeded, uh, George Misko who was uh, familiar with the voices of the Russians in the Russian embassy, because he did the translating of the tapes, is that correct?

**Boris Tarasoff:** That's correct. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Uh, then I would like to also [00:39:00] ask you if, you know, if there was anybody else other than George Misko. Who was in the, uh, American Embassy in, uh, September and October, 1963 that was as familiar with the voices of the Russians and the Russian embassies, and then yourself as familiar as you were?

**Boris Tarasoff:** Uh, I doubt it for the simple reason that I had to deal them day in and day out. And, uh, the people at the opposite would probably get a crack at them once in a while. Which wouldn't give them a sufficient basis for to know the people. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** To identify the voicesto put them with the people. Uh, then I would like to ask you if, uh, anyone checked with you to verify whether or not you had an opinion as to who the voice was on the other end of the call with Oswald on both conversations. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Not that I know of. 

**Kenneth Brooten:** Mrs. Tarasoff, do you know of anybody in the American Embassy during that time that was as familiar with the Russian voices as your husband? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No, I don't think there was. Really. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Alright. Very good. I, 

**Ann Tarasoff:** [00:40:00] because actually they, the reason why they, uh, had him come down was they needed somebody that was proficient.

There were some people that. Had a slight knowledge of Russian, but as far as being proficient, you know, 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** can, can I ask you what you were talking about, voice identity tapes that you've made and play, put the tape with the name. Did you have, were those tapes, identity tapes made before or after the Oswald call?

**Ann Tarasoff:** These tapes were made regularly then. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Do you recall having made them in, but when you first came on or was it sometime after? 

**Ann Tarasoff:** No, this was sometime after. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Was it after the assassination? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Mm-hmm. 

**Ann Tarasoff:** Yes. 

**Boris Tarasoff:** Definitely. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** So there were no voice identity tapes that they could match voices with during the time of this time?

**Ann Tarasoff:** No, that was... 

**Boris Tarasoff:** That particular tape was kept 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** for later on, but at the time the tape was transcribed, there was no, no voice identity tape and no one is proficient in Russian and knowing the voices than yourself? 

**Boris Tarasoff:** No, I don't think so. 

**Jonathan Blackmer:** Very good. So thank you very much. We can, uh, conclude the, uh, interview.
