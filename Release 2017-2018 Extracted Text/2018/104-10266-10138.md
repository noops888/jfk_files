In view of Station Mexico City's statement in paragraph

LIRING-3 "still has strong anti-U.S.

feelings", the time

come to rester the LiRING 3/Ope. in the same cable. the Stationi

sett forth several control elements including true name receipts

and taps made in ROWIN'S safelouse of LIRING-3's amourous

sessions with a young ait student

What appears to be lacking 1A

net considering the case as the handling of a double agent.

possibly host1le, ais"

homework--that is to say, that there are

certain actions that should be taken in the case

as follows:

a. Placing of a phone tap on L3's telephone, if

it can be determined that he bes a telephone.

b. Intercept of all mail going to LIRING-3's home

address.

c: Physical and photo surveillance of L-3 to determine

20-1220

any patterns of

actions or contacts with suspicious persons. if

I-3's contacts

and

actions agree with what L-3 tells ROWTON and

to allow ROWTON to be prepared to cover himself in his relations

with L-3.

d. To discretelly investigate I-3's sources of income,

L.e., to see if his income from teaching art classes (and more

recently from his rife's

¡ salary from rave) are sufficient to

account for his scale of living, whatever it is.

There are indications in the file that: the "homework"

as sutlined above his not yet been done.. The Station was

no 1

queried in DIR 39039 and in DIR- 07441 as to, the above matters.

It is noted in MEXICO CITY- 8944 that the Station said that

it did not as yet have "independent checks" on this agent,

beyond evidence of entry to the Cuban Embassy furnished by

LIONION photo surveillance, and in fact had only his word on

can premesus iorespondence,

claimed actions and statements. and that LIENVOY and LITAINI-L

confirm that L-4, L-3's wife, is definitely employed as a

secretary to LIRING-l as claimed by L3. The Station tended to

doubt that 1-3 is a Cuban plant but said that even if he were,

that it was no additional risk (ize Station was Irfezing 1o

a proposed

trip by L-3 to Cuba) since L-3 would be provided with

# suitable uncheckable explanation as to how L3 obtained info

on the LOPEZ case.

e. Check as suggested

in DIR 07441 on status

LIRING- 4's father, who is presuzably a Chinese, repurtedly in

the United States. This is of interest in view of stringent

U.S. entry requirements laid on Chinese.

CUBAN INTEREST IN CHARTERING SERCHANT VESSELS

ACQ

SOURCE

MEXICO, MEXICO CITY

FIELD NO.

A MEXICAN INTELLECTUAL WIO IS A NEW, UNWITTING REPORTING ASSET.

SOURCE HAS CULTURAL AND FAMILY TIES IN CUBA. HE OBTAINED THIS

INFORNATION DURING CONFIDESTIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFICIALS OF

THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO.

1. ACCORDING TO WORD RECEIVED IN MEXICO FROM AN OFFICIAL OF THE CUBAN

NINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE, CUBA'S MOST URGENT REQUIREMEVT AT THE MONENT IS.

THE CHARTERING OF 24 SHIPS, VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS "OF MEDIUM TONNAGE" AND

"OF APPROXIMATELY 10,000 TONS", FOR USE IN 1967. THIS PROJECT IS BEING

HELD AS SECRET INFORMATION, AND MANY CUBAN OFFICIALS DO NOT KNOW OF IT, EVEN

IF THEY ARE CO/CERNED WITH TRADE AND SHIPPING MATTERS.

COMMENT:

THE SHIPS ARE POSSIBLY TO BE USED TO TRANSPORT THE 1967 SUGAR CROP, WHICH

ALLEGEDLY WILL REACH LARGE PROPORTIONS.

→ COMMENT: PERHAPS A REDUCTIOI

IS EXPECTED IN SOVIET ASSISTANCE IN THE MATTER OF SHIPPING.)

2. AURELIO ALONSO GONZALEZ, OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE, IS

GOING TO CANADA ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER TO SEEK THE BEST AND

CHEAPEST CHANNEL FOR RENTING SHIPS. HIS TRIP IS NOT BEING PUBLICIZED

BECAUSE PAST EXPERIENCE HAS SHOW THAT CHARTERING IS MORE DIFFICULT AND

EXPENSIVE
