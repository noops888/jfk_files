/LIRING/OPERATIONAL/PRQ Part IX oa LIRING-3
“HERON RE QUOED - REFERS

Reference; HHMA 30540 of 10 November 1966

1, A PEQ Part IL for LIRING"3 is being forvarded under separate
cover, It is to be noted that LIRING-3 has not been recruited in the
name of WOFACT, but instead is engaged in clandestine activities for
| Mallace R. ROUTON. who LIRING"3 believes

2, The fact that LIRINI-3 is not aware of hie WOFACT connection, at
the present tinc, outveights the value which would accrue vere an attempt
nade to make bim knowledgeable. He performs clandestinely for ROWZON

dhe is actualy attacking priority targets. In this way he works
against the target vith # clear conscience and his left-wing sentiments
are not threatencd,

3, The operation is moving, however, toward the eventual full re~
cruitment of LIRING"3, but it 18 moving slovly in that direction because

of the political and social beliefs of Subject. One advantage of this
falee flag recruttment of this individual, at the present tine, is the

fact that he is able to eater the target area without fear of capture and
exposure as an enemy agent. Under the present plan of operation he believes
his work actually fs aiding the revolution uhich he believes in from an
idealistic standpoint.

MEMORANDUM:
SUBJECT : Handling of LIRING-3 as Hostile Agent

In view of Station Mexico City's statement in paragraph
6 of MEXI 8944 (IN 23093), which presumably comes from

LIRING-3's handler Wallace B. ROWION, to the effect that
pony

LIRING-3 "still has strong anti. feelings". the time, has

deatys )
come to review the LIRING-3/Op8r al A the samc cable. the Station

seft forth several control elenents including true name receipts

and taps made in ROWIAN'S safekouse of LIRING-3's amourous

student What avpears to be lacking i,

sessions wilh a yo’

wet considering the case as the handling of a doubte agent.
‘i a

ny
hostile, gis homework--that is to say, that there are

A
certain actions that should be taken in the case as follows:

a. Placing of.a phose tap on L-3's telephone, if

it can be determined that he bes a telephone.

b. Intercept of all mail going to LIRING-3's home

address.

e of L-3 to determine
hy pat

= of actions or contacts with suspicious persons. ,if

e with what L-3 tells ROWT@N and

ec; Physical and photo surveillanc

any pattern

I-3's contacts and actions agre|

to allow ROWIQN to be prepared to cover himself in his relations

with L-3.
a. To discrefby investigate I-3's sources of income,

i.e,, to see if his income fron teaching art classes (and more

eu htras
recently from his wife's salary from HRRPNG) are sufficient to

account for his scale of living, whatever it 1s.



ao sn) ea et TE ean

There are indications in the file that: the “honework'

as outlined above has not yet been done. The Station was

Din 104d mod
queried in DIR 39039, and in DIR- OT! as to, the above matters.
It is noted in Mexico crTy- 8444 that the Station said that
4t did not as yet have "independent checks” on this agent,
beyond evidence of entry to the Cuban Embassy furnished by
LIONION photo surveillance, and_in fact had only his word on

Tm pletion coaapradence »

claimed actions and statements. andy that LIENVOY and LITAINT-2
confirm that L-4, L-3's wife, is definitely employed as a
secretary to LIRING-1 as claimed by L-3. The Station tended to

doubt that L-3 is a Cuban plant but said that even if he were,

that it was no additioual risk (the Station was r ing to

a proposed trip by L-3 to Cuba) since L-3 would be provided with
x suitable uncheckable explenation as to how 1-3 obtained info

on the LOPEZ case.

e. Check as suggested in DIR 07441 on status of
LIRING-4's father, who is presunably a Chinese, repurtedly ia

the United States. This is of interest in view of stringent

U.S. entry requirements laid on Chinese.
