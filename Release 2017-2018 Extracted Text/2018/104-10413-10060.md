Dear acid of Justic

pantingtons

DI. Robert H. Bahmer

Archivist of the United States

National Archives and Records Service

Washington, D.C. 20408

Dear DI. Bahmer:

I have been asked to reply to the informal inquiries

which you and the Deputy Administrator of General Services,

Joe E. Moody, have made to this Department concerning the

authority and procedures for releasing for public disclo

sure certain of the documentary material that was produced

or acquired ky the President's Commission on the Assassi-

nation of Prusident Kennedy (the Warren Commission).

The Conmission has, of course, completed its inves

tigation, submitted its

report, and transferred all of

its records, papers, and other

documentary material to

the National Archives for preservation. Many scholars

and other persons are anxious to study that material.

Last year, the Executive departments and agencies

which had furnished documentary material to the Commis-

sion developed certain guidelines for determining which

of the items they had furnished could be released to the

public. As a result of the applications of those guide-

lines, approximately two thirds of that material has been

made

available to the public.

Since the Cormission did not provide any guidance of.

impose any restrictions in this regard at the time that

its files were transferred to your agency, since the Com-

mission is now out of existence, and since your agency is

now the receiver and custodian of the records of the Com-

mission, this Department believes the Administrator of

General Services, acting through you and your staff, is

now in the same legal and administrative position with

respect to the records, papers, and other documentary

material transferred to your agency by the Cormission, as

the Commission was prior to that transfer.

Consequently, we believe that your agency has the

authority and obligation to review that material' and to

determine which of it should be made available to, or

withheld from, the public at this time, and to conduct

subsequent reviews of such material at reasonable inter-

vals until all of it is released. In this regard, we

believe it would be appropriate for your reviews of that

material to be made in conformity with the guidelines

which were developed and applied by the various Executive

departments and agencies with respect to the material they

had contributed to she Commission. However, we do not con-

sider those guidelines as imposing absolute standards for

the release or disclosure of Commission-produced material

in your custody. If in any specific case a sound legal

basis exists for withholding or for releasing any such

material notwithstanding provisions of the guidelines,

your agency should, of course, disregard the guidelines.

Similarly, if sound archival or other principles or rea

sons, not inconsistent with law, exist for disregarding

the guidelines in some particular case, we believe that it

would be appropriate" for your agency to disregard the guide-

lines in that case.' If any significant legal problem should

arise in this regard, the Department of Justice will, of

course, be happy to

assist you in any way that we can.

Sincerely,

rank M. Wozencraft

Assistant Attorney General

Mr. Randall:

According to telcon between Mr. Savige (Info & Priv) and

Mr. Johnson of Nat'1 Archives on 12 Dec 75, CIA apparently

needed to review for declassification of material on Lists

1, IA, 2 and 2A (see attachments) just the documents which

were forwarded to us

along with the lists by NARS. Mr. Paul

Hartman reviewed the documents (also attached and has made

appropriate notations for declassification.
