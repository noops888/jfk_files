Director, HSCA, on 12/13/77. It is believed the HSCA is
considering interview of some agents involved in COINTELPRO
activities against King and SCLC and in the MURKIN
investigation. The ESCA has requested expeditious handling
of its King related requests and, therefore, a Bureau
deadline in this matter is being established.

Counterintellirence efforts against King and SCLC
were carried out in the substantive investigative files as
well as under the COINTEL Program. Therefore, the field is
being reauired to provide case agents in all of these

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

New Orleans, Louisiana
December 14, 1977

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

On December 6, 1977, Special Agent (SA) Stephen
M. Callender of the New Orleans Office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was interviewed by
Reter G, Beeson, Mark A. Speiser, and Lisa Berlow, Staff
Counsel of the HSCA.

The questioning related to the investigation
conducted by the New Orleans Office of the FBI regarding the
assassination of Martin Luther King.

In response to thein initial questions; they were
informed that SA Callender has been a Special Agent of the
FBI since August, 1951 and that he has been assigned to the
New Orleans FBI Office since December, 1961. SA Callender
was. assigned a case involving the assassination of Martin
Luther King:within the Néw Orleans FBI Office. His main

involving the investigation. This included reading and
veviewing all incoming and outgoing communications ,

assisted in assigning of leads. review all investigation
conducted to be suré that it was complete and thorough.
Joseph T, Sylvester, Jr., in April, 1968, was the Assistant
Agent in Charge of the New Orleans Office of the FBI and was
overall in charge of the investigation conducted by New
Opleans. SA Callender probably was assigned the case by

Mr. Sylvester, inasmuch as SA Callender was working on

handled Civil Rights: and related matters, SA Callender had
worked for Sylvester for better than six years and had experience
in the handling of "paper" on other major investigations:

This document contains neither recommendations nor
conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the
FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and its

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS

fin addition, the Staff Counsel was provided with administrative
fata relating to the normal procedures in opening and

ssigning a case as well as the handling of leads and

eporting procedures and the closing of cases.

In response to their questions, they were informed
that SA Callender had not reviewed the Martin Luther King
assassination file in New Orleans prior to this interview
and had not conversed with anyone regarding the interview
before the "Staff Counsel", other than with a Bureau official,
én December 6, 1977 prior to the interview.
; They were informed that the last time SA Callender
had thorwghly reviewed the King assassination file in New
leans was possibly eight or nine years ago. There would
Have been no reason since that time to thoroughly review this
file, That within the past six months, small portions of
the New Orleans file had been reviewed to locate specific
ommunications which were to be sent to FBI Headquarters,
ashington, D.C., upon instructions of the Department of
ustice, as a result of a court order being issued in another
matter involving King.

It was apparent’ from the ensuing questions of the
Staff Counsel that they were attempting to determine and were
looking for a possible conspiracy in the assassination of
ee in the investigation conducted by New Orleans.

The Staff Counsel initially pointed out that there
was a memorandum in the New Orleans file that a woman, whose
name was set forth (name not recalled by SA Callender),
reportedly had some information about the King assassination,
but was not to be contacted as she was a friend of District
Attorney Jim Garrison.

Upon response to questions, SA Callender informed
that to the best of his recollection, former District Attorney
Jim Garrison of Orleans Parish, New Orleans, had not
eonducted an investigation into thé assassination of King,
that instructions had been received from Bureau Headquarters
net to have any contact with Garrison prior to the King
: assassination. This probably was a result of Garrison's
claims that his investigation into the assassination of President
Kennedy had determined there was a conspiracy and the results
of his investigation were at odds with the conclusions of the
Warren Commission, It was SA Callender's recollection that

|

|

-HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

,ON ASSASSINATIONS

:

Garrison was critical of the FBI's investigative efforts
‘in the assassination of President Kennedy. They were
‘informed that it had been SA Callender's experience that
the FBI would not share sources or informants with other
jagencies and that Garrison's cooperation in the King
‘investigation had not been solicited,

t

i In response to their questions, they were
informed that Kent Courtney was in the newspaper business
and that his political reputation was that of a
conservative. The Staff Counsel then informed that
‘information supplied to them indicated that Kent Courtney
of Alexandria, Louisiana, had contacted the New Orleans

FBI Office sometime after the assassination and informed
that he was going to interview the brother of James Earl
Ray and this brother was going to supply information
belating to a conspiracy. Courtney desived an FBI Agent

to be present during this interview. According to this
Inemorandum, Courtney was advised an FBI Agent would not be
present and that he should contact the District Attorney's
Office at Memphis, Tennessee regarding this proposed
interview. The Staff Counsel also indicated that there were
instructions from the fae Headquarters that Courtney was
net to be contacted.

: In response to their questions, they were informed
fhat the reason Courtney was referred to the District Attorney's
ffice at Memphis was not recalled, but possibly was because
that agency had a primary jurisdiction in the murder of

King. It has been SA Callender's experience that the

Bureau's policy in dealing with the press in those days was
formulated at Washington, D.C. and for the most part,

eontrolhéd from Bureau Headquarters and especially in a

matter involving the magnitude of the King investigation.

They indicated they had received information that a person

with the first name of Kent (last name unknown) attended

a Ku Klux Klan function at Alexandria, Louisiana and were
informed that to the best of SA Callender'’s recollection,

Kent Courtney had not ever been identified as a Klan member.

In response to their questions, they were informed that

Klan groups active in Louisiana at the time of the King
assassination were the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
the United Klans of America, and the Griginal Knights of

the Ku Klux Klan of the 6th District. The Silver Dollar

‘Grgiip was a Klan type organization around the Vidalia-

Ferriday, Louisima, area. It was not recalled if this group
was associated with the UKA or the Minutemeénn or was a
separate organization.

} No information had been developed vegarding
possible involvement of organized crime in this matter.
The name of Frank Liherte: was not familiar at this time.
It was recalled by SA Callender that there had béen a
conversation between two men in Memphis who were in the
produce business which apparently was derogatory in
nature regarding King. As a result, an interview had
been conducted of an individual in New Orleans who was
in the produce business.

Thatcinvestigation to identify the New Orleans
Italian industrialist who reportedly was to give Ray
money which. information was furnished by Charles Stein
hdd been conducted, however, the extent of the investigation
was not recalled. Investigation had been conducted in the
area of the Chef Menteur Highway, however, the extent was
not recalled. That Willard Robertson was at that time a
distributor for Volkswagen, which was located near the
Chef Menteur Highway. It wads believed Bobertson had
been interviewed, however, the results could not be recalled.

That attempts were made to identify "Raoul",
however the extent was not recalled. That a lieutenant
on, the Louisiana State Police Force by the first name of
Raoul had been located and interviewed, however, the results
of the interview were not recalled,

To the best of SA Callender's recollection, the
John Birch Society and White Citizens Council, had not been
investigated in connection with the King assassination
and in fact, neither of these groups had ever been
investigated by the FBI in Louisiana. It could not be
recalled if investigation was conducted dt the Wallace
Campaign Headquarters in New Orleans to determine if Ray
was known, however, it was believed that this investigation
had been conducted.

That bars in the 400 and 500 block of Canal Street
in New Orleans had been canvassed inasmuch as Ray reportedly
was seen in this area when in New Orleans.

That Bud's Flower Room is located on St. Claude
Avenue in New Orleans and is rented out as a meeting hall

P.55050 Docld:32989748 Page 13



HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS

to various organizations and that in the past, Klan meetings
have been held at this meeting hall.

A group known as "Truth or Consequences" was
- formed by New Orleans businessmen to raise money for
Jim Garrison to conduct his investigation into the
Kennedy assassination.

That Cecil Shilstone is a self-employed New
Orleans businessman who had been publicly identified as
a member of Truth or Consequences. Sometime after the
assassination of King, Shilstone and his attorney
appeared at the New Orleans Office and informed that a rumor
was going around the New Orleans business community
that Shilstone allegedly was a New Orleans industrialist
who Ray reportedly came to New Orleans to contact and
get money. That Shilstone emphatically denied this
allegation. and that he was not involved in any manner
or could he supply any information relating to the
King assassination.

Bhat all informants and sources in the New
Orleans Division were contacted regarding James Earl
Ray in an effort to determine “Ray was known or had
any association with any white hate groups or black
extremist organization.

That it could not be recalled what investigation
may have been conducted at Denham Springs, Louisiana,
regarding a remark allegedly made sometime prior to the
assassination that a collection ought to be taken up to
get somebody to shoot King.

To SA Callender's récollection, there was no
racial prejudice among agents assigned to the New Orleans.
Office and that there was no negro agents assigned to this
office at the time of the King investigation. In addition,
the "Staff Counsel" mentioned several names of persons,
however, these names mentioned were not familiar to SA
Callender at this time.

captioned matter, 7 an

‘ The Bureau's attention is directed to the fact :
the FCC does not have an office in the Memphis area; however,
an official’of the Memphis PD did contact a representative
ofthe FCC at Atlanta, Ga., to report this incident. No |
inquiry has been received by the Memphis PD or this office
from FCC relative to this referenced. incident and therefore
it appears FCC is not Snterested in a cB radio transmission:
of this type.

Concerning the possibility of interviewing other
individuals contacted by the Memphis PD during its investi-.°
gation of this matter, it is pointed out no attempt was made.

-to interview these individuals due to the investigation
conducted by the Memphis: PD and due to the lack of evidence
indicating anyone other than EDWARD LE MASTER MONTEDONICO,
JR., waS responsible for this radio. ‘transmission. ‘

EDWARD 'LE MASTER MONTEDONICO, JR., was interviewed.
as indicated on the encloséd FD 302. He indicated during the
interview that he had a great deal of experience in CB radio
transmissions. and in the opération of these units. He
commented several times that. anyone with a knowledge of
CB rvadios“could disguise their voice and’ transmission so as
to go on broadcasting without being identified. He also said

* that there is no way for anyone, including FCC, to identify
the sender of a transmission such as. the one mentioned above
unless the guilty individual made the admission that he or
she was the individual that made the broadcast,

s

It is also noted that others during this inves-
tigation expressed the same opinion that it is impossible
to identify the individual making a broadcast of this type
unless the guilty person admitted-doing same.

It was determined also that there are numexous
individuals in the Memphis area operating CB radios illegally
and/or without being properly licensed. It was further determined
that numerous individuals broadcast using "skip" identification,
which is illegal,but which is known only to the sender and

-2-

receiver. There are also numerous, licensed CB radio
operators in the Memphis arm and it was suggested that

there are possibly an equal number that are not licensed

and, therefore, it would be virtually impossible to interview
each- and every individual either having a CB unit or having
access to one.

Various individuals commented during. this investigation 7
that no one gets too éxcited about illegal broadcasts since
the FCC generally levies a fbne of up to $50 and possibly .
lifting the license for 3 to 6 months if a person is guilty *
according to the FCC of making a broadcast of this type.
Therefore,.no one does much about these-illegal transmissions

* since: the punishment is this light. It was expressed that

the greatest fear of CB operators is the bad name they f
receive when incidents of this nature are made public. eo.

In light of the above, UACB no, further investigation
is being conducted concerning referenced matter, -

received a telephone call from an individual who identified
himself as ED CHAUNCEY, telephone number 276-0643, who
reported that he was monitoring his CB radio and overheard
an unknown operator’ in a- mobile unit who claimed that
he was chasing a white Mustang. Mr. CHAUNCEY at this
_ time advised Lieutenant McCACHREN that he (CHAUNCEY)
was in contact with another CB: operator known to him,
namely BILL AUSTEIN, and that the three CB operators,
namely the unknown operator, AUSTEIN, and CHAUNCEY, were
in contact with each other, and Mr. CHAUNCEY would supply
all information he received to the Police Department to
a 7 assist them with regard to a chase in which thesunknown "
| operator claimed to be involved. Thereafter, on April 6,
| ’ 1968, Lieutenant J, D, MUSIC talked byiitelephone again
ane with’ both Mr. ED CHAUNCEY at the above telephone number
‘and with Mr. AUSTEIN, both of them at that time furnishing
substantially the same information.as to what had
occurred with regard to-these transmissions, by an unknown
-CB operator.

= .' Inspeetor ZACHARY advised that Lieutenant
RUFUS BRADSHAW,\:Car No. 160, had been contacted on

stated that Mr. WILLIAM HUBBARD AUSTEIN, age 22, of

24 North Montgomery Stréet,. Apartment 103, an employee

of Clendenin Heating arid~Air Conditioning, Inc., had -
flagged down Lieutenant BRADSHAW at Jackson and Hollywood
on the evening of April.4, 1968, and called Lieutenant

in turn, dispatched to the police dispatcher the nature’
of the information being received on Channel 17 of the
CB radio. Lieutenant BRADSHAW listened to the CB radio
in Mr. AUSTEIN's car and heard several different CB
operators talking on Channel 17. ‘

In substance, an unknown CB operator was
giving report. to his chase of white Mustang
oceupied by & Whes waise. Ofhay operators,
including Mr. AUSTEIN, were attempting to communicate
with this unknown operator, attempting to get him to
identify himself, and informing him that they would

unknown operator. The unknown operator, who claimed he
was chasing. the Mustang, never identified himself. :
Lieutenant BRADSHAW dispatched police cars to the

areas’ in which the unknown CB operator claimed to be
traveling, and none of the units dispatched saw any
activity such as that described by the unknown CB
operator, Lieutenant BRADSHAW was of the definite |
opinion, after the unknown person making these reports
had: finally left the air, that the entire CB broadcast
by this person was a complete hoax,

e- Inspector ZACHARY advised, after listening to
‘the police dispatcher's tape recording, and after talking
to Lieutenant BRADSHAW, that there were a.number of factors
to indicate that the above-mentioned broadcast:on CB
Channel 17.by the unknown person was a complete hoax.
He stated that the final proof that this matter was a
complete hoax was based upon communication between the
Police Department and the Shelby County Sheriff's Office
at the time the broadcast was in progress. After the cen
“unknown operator reported. his. position as proceeding east : .
en Jackson Avenue toward-Raleigh, Tennessee, the Police
Department -immediately contacted the Shelby County
Sheriff's Office to alert that department, which had the
responsibility for policing Raleigh, Tennessee, which is
located outside the city limits of Memphis. During the :
time that this broadcast was being made, and after the : ‘
unknown CB operator reported his position at the” main
intersection at a stop light in Raleigh, Tennessee, .
(Jackson Avenue and Stage Road), where the unknown ;
operator claimed the Mustang had run the stop: light at
an excessive rate of speed, the Shelby County Sheriff's
Office advised the Memphis Police Department that this:
information was false, since the Shelby County’Sheriff's
Office had two units of its.men stationed at this
intersection, and no such incident had occurred and no
such vehicles as those described by the unknown operator
had passed through ‘that intersection.

ve

Inspector ZACHARY advised that as a result of.
a separate inquiry made by the Police Department
‘concerning this hoax report, he had determined that
there had been no contacts whatever between any unit
.of the Memphis Police Department and the vehicles
beckett by the unknown person on the CB radio.
nspector ZACHARY advised that at one point the unkpown

CB operator, in response to an inquiry from another CB
operator, identified his own automobile as a 1966 blue
Pontiac. Inspector ZACHARY pointed out that if there
had been a high speed chase of a’ white Mustang by a
1966 blue Pontiac, then phis would have attracted

. attention of numerous persons, and no one, other than

. . tke unknown CB radio operator, reported any such chase,

- Inspector ZACHARY advised that. he contemplated
“Some additional inquiry regarding this matter in an effort
to identify the person who made this hoax report, but
insofar as the investigation of the’murderer of Dr.
. KING was concerned, he was. certain that the chase
_reported by the unknown operator did not. occur.

. On. April 10, 1968, Lieutenant J. D. _HANBY,
Homicide Bureau, Memphis Police Department; advised that
he had interviewed in detail Mr. WILLIAM HERBERT AUSTEIN, '
male white, age 22, of 24 North Montgomery, Apartment 103,
home telephone number: 276-0986, an employee of Clendenin
Heating and Air Conditioning, ine., and at this time

Mr. AUSTEIN furnished to him the following accéunt of “

the above-mentioned incident:

Mr. AUSTEIN is a licensed CB operator, having
call letters KOM-8637, who has both a mobile unit and ~----.
a base station, the base station being located at his home
at 24 North Montgomery, Apartment 103, in.Memphis. Mr.
AUSTEIN furnished to Lieutenant HAMBY the following

- information concerning an incident which occurred on the
_afternoon of April 4, 1968: "° es

He was at Zayre's Department Store on Poplar .
Avenue in Memphis until approximately, 5:55 p.m., When he
left that store and drove to Carlton's Esso Service Centex
on the corner of Madison and Bellevue, As he arrived at ISEEEEEERD
that service station, he heard the news on a commercial
radio broadcast concerning the shooting of Dr. MARTIN
LUTHER KING. After being at thi# service station about
five minutes, he drove to his apartment at 24 North
Montgomery. As nearly as he can recall, he then left
his apartment around 6:12 p.m., en route to Steamfitters
Local 614 on Jackson Avenue near Gragg School. En route
to this location, while he was traveling east on Jackson

in the vicinity of Springdale, and at approximately
6:30 p.m., he,was monitoring CB Channel 17 when he
heard a mobilé unit request another mobile unit to call
the Police Department by "land line" (telephone). A
base station answered the caller, telling the caller
that the base station would call the police, the base
; station inquiring as to ‘the nature of the eall that he
: " should make. . About this time, due to static, the
original caller and the base station were unable to-.
communicate, At this same time, AUSTEIN noticed that
. ‘the original caller who was requesting police assistance ~~
was very close to'Mr., AUSTEIN's position, because there
was a very high reading on the signal strength meter nase
on the CB radio -in Mr. AUSTEIN's car, Mr. AUSTEIN. .- se +
therefore broke into the conversation between the original - imeees
caller and ‘the basé station, telling the caller that-he. 7
(Mr. AUSTEIN) was very close to him, that Mr. AUSTEIN had
; just spotted a police car and would relay the caller’ s
“message to the police.-

At this point, the original caller stated that-
“77 + he was chasing 2 white Mistang easton Sumter Avenue: and
that the occupants of the Mustang were responsible for
Dr. KING's murder. .Mr. AUSTEIN immediately flagged down-
the police car and. thereafter talked with the Lieutenant
who was in this police. car at Loeb's Barbeque at the
intersection of Jackson and Hollywood. The Lieutenant
requested Mr. AUSTEIN to communicate again with ‘the :
unknown CB operator to determine that person's present a
“location. ‘Mr. AUSTEIN called'to this mobile unit by , 7
~, Saying, "Mobile that is chasing the white Mustang, what
is your. present 10-20?" (The signal 10-20 means location.)
The original caller replied that he was approaching _
Highland on Summer Avenue at a high rate of speed. Mr.
AUSTEIN relayed this information to the Police Lieutenant,
who in turn relayed this information to the police
dispatcher at central police headquarters.

The Lieutenant told Mr.AUSTEIN to keep talking
to the unknown caller so that the police could be
continuously informed as to his direction and location
xr that the police could intéresnt the atonebiie

t y¥ UGlng chased, Mr. AUSTRIN lost coucact with

times, he finally re-established contact with him. _ |

7 Mr. AUSTEIN inquired of the unknown caller
as to the description of the car that the unknown
caller was driving so that the police would be able to
j ; easily identify the two vehicles when the police did
intercept them. ‘The unknown caller responded that: he
was driving a 1966 blue Pontiac and that as of that
time the white Mustang was exceeding 75 miles per. hour,
and at the same time stating that the Mustang had
turned north off Suminer* Avene, ‘the caller giving the
name of the street on which this turn was made, but
Mr. AUSTEIN not recalling the name of the street as of:
the tine of this interview on April, 10, 1968.
i

At this time .there was ‘some confusion as to: |
the direction. that the Mustang and Pontiac were allegedly
taking. ‘This confusion-‘was due ‘in part to the fact that°
some CB base station had broken into the transmissions.
and Mr, AUSTEIN could not hear the transmissions being .
made: by -the unknown mobile unit. =aaen 5

The next transmission. that. dr. AUSTEIN could

effect that this. unit had: turned north ‘and was ‘approaching
Raleigh (a subusb northeast of.Memphis) on Jackson Avenue.
Shortly after the unknown operator stated that “he -was—- -----
‘ approaching Raleigh, that same ope:

sta neon caller also stated that his speed
. at7that* : tinie was. in excess of 100 miles pér hour. Mr.
-¥ AUSTEIN asked the unknown operator to secure the license
number of the Mustang, to which the unknown operator
replied that he was afraid to get that close because
several shots had already been fired at him.

On the last transmission -of the unknown 7
operator, Mr. AUSTEIN stated that this unknown operator ~~"
stated that he had just passed "the Millington exit"
| . and the Mustang was gaining on him even though he had
“the Pontiac "flat out." (Mr. AUSTEIN «nderstood that
the unknown operator was indicating that he was driving
as fast as the Pontiac would go.)

Mr. AUSTEIN called this unknown operator
several other times but received no response, He also

Since that transmission, he wanted. to furnish the following

FERGUSON has a CB radio. His car is a 1966

area covered by the’ transmissions mentioned above,
since FERGUSON and others were supposed to be ata
meeting at 3754 Jackson “Avenue at Steamfitters Local .
614 at 7:00 p.m. Since.Mr.-AUSTEIN knows that FERGUSON 7
has a CB antenna located on:a. trunk mount, FERGUSON's
CB signals will be directional. That is, ‘when FERGUSON
is transmitting, his signal will be stronger in one

ve direction than in.another direction, the strongest

signal’ being to the front of the vehicle, the weakest ha
Signals being to either side, and the signal to the . PeaEar!
-rear o£ the vehicle being of moderate strength, EEE ess alee eee

: Mt: AUSTEIN went on to’ state’ that’ if the aauaunt
unknown caller were traveling east and ‘then turned

north, the unknown caller's signals would have dropped
because of, the directional properties of the trunk~mount
‘antenna, Mr. AUSTEIN noticed that when ‘thé unknéwn

caller reported that’ he was turning. forth off Summer

Avenue, the Signal droppéd”to the point where Mr. AUSTEIN -
had difficulty” hearing the transmissions.

, When Mr.. AUSTEIN arrived at the Union Hall,

he was questioned by his instructor, Mr. EDWARD MORGAN,

as to why he was late. Mr. AUSTEIN explained ta. him

what had occurred in the présence of other persons at ‘

_the Union meeting. Mr. FERGUSON, mentioned above, was : ote

one of those present. Mr.’ HORGAN indicated a displeasure ~ sce
y over the fact that Mr. AUSTEIN had attempted to assist

the police in locating the murderer of Dr. KING, FERGUSON

at this time made the statement, "Were you the one that I

heard in that mess on Channel 17?" Mr. AUSTEIN told

FERGUSON that he (AUSTEIN) was the operator attempting

to relay information to the police. FERGUSON made a’

remark to the effect that if AUSTEIN had “any sense at

all," he should have helped the white Mustang to escape.

FERGUSON went on to make other remarks indicating that .

AUSTEIN should hot have assisted the police to catch a :

man. who had performed a public service (FERGUSON indicating

by his. remarks.that he thought that the person who killed

Dr. KING had done a ptiblic service).

AUSTEIN did not see FERGUSON again for some
45 minutes,when the entire group was dismissed early
because of the curfew which had been imposed. As those
present left the meeting, AUSTEIN told FERGUSON to .-call-
him on the CB radio when both were in their cars,
because AUSTEIN wanted to see how his unit sounded.

- He added that ‘this is ‘a ommon practice among CB operators.
Shortly thereafter FERGUSON did Gall AUSTEIN, and when
FERGUSON started to talking on the CB. radio, AUSTEIN -
associated FERGUSON's voice with the voice he had heard °” oe
earlier’ from the unknown person who made _the hoax
transmissions as outlined above.

i During this interview, Mr. AUSTEIN identified
one of the other CB operators who attempted to assist
‘the unknown caller and Mr. AUSTEIN as Mr. ED CHAUNCEY,
Mr. CHAUNCEY having contacted the Police Department by

break in his voice.said he did not make the CB radio trans-
mission in.question and after wiping a tear that -had welled up

in his eye added-he does not know or have any idea who made
that transmission. He said he could not understand why anyone
would accuse him ‘of this act. ‘He said that whoever accused him
. Of this::does not know what they are talking about.

: Mr. MONTEDONICO. said that he did “not think there

“were many CB operators in Memphis who had knowledge-of these
units that would be knowledgeable enough to pinpoint anyone
making a CB transmission of this type. He went on to add that
anyone with knowledge of CB radios could disguise their voices
and cause distortions in the transmission so. as to be unable
to be identified. ‘He said anyone with any knowledge of CB tok
radios and transmissions of this type knows. no one can positively
identify the source of the transmission unless the guilty

person etasipetcade it.

of over 15, and tha modulation was strong and clear, which indicated to hiu that the unit
was Bo mora than two miles away. .
Bo fursher rélated that during the chase, and observing hia S-meter, he was of the opinion _
thax tke mobile chasing the Mustang wae in. the northeast section of Mewphis and that he wag

"familiar with that part of tha town, and sspecially when he stated that he was portbbourd

Aa atatad pfeviously when questioning Auctein as to the posaible identity of the parson -
Benponsible for thie hoax, he appeared to be ‘hesitant and showed an indicdtion chat he
&t least had a suspieica as to who this uiknown CB operator was, After exploining to’ .-
dr. Austain tha. seriousnase of the offensa committed by the unknown CB operator, plus the
“gact that thio ancident would give Cera a black eye as far as the general public wag
coicexned, he finally otated chat -he did have a person in mind that could nx have caused
thi incident, but that he only knew bis last name and where he Wao euployed. He reluctantly
skated chat thio person's name was Ferguson, employed by Ben J. alone Co. os ‘an apprentica
ateamfitter, aid that he balonged to Steamfitter's Local No. 614 at 3754 Jackson Ave., 2
which da cight beside Gregg School, the same one tharht belonged to. He further stated .
that Fergueon hag a Gitizen’e Band radio in hio car, the same type a9 hia, and that his

He further stared char if Ferguaon had been traveling eastward, or east on Sumer, ard
turned left va or north, hie signal would have dropped because of the directional properties
ef the antenna, When tha man who claimed he was chasing the Mustang stated that he was
turhing lefe (or north) off Summer Aves, his signal strength did drop to the point that -he
had d4fficulcy copying coma of bia transmissions. ‘The last two or three’ transmissions.

that the man made, his signal strength remained conatant or steady. According to tha |
broadcast he was making, which was going cast out of town ond away from him, hia signal

strong. Ha stated hio S-mater indicated 15 or over, which indicated chat he could nos

have been mora than possibly two miles from him, and sitting still. .

Ha stated that after ha left tha lieutenant at, Hollywood & Jackson, he proceeded east on

When he arrived, he wae questioned by hia instructor, 4. Edvard Morgan, ao to, why he was

he had been relaying information froma car that claimed that he vas chasing King's mxdexer,
and that he could not leave the police officer until he lost tha mobile unit signal. Ho
said that’ at this time Me. Morgan became very angry at him for attempting to help the

Me. Satchfield has tha reputation of being ona of the best CB radio machanica in Memphis.

santed to keep in contact with the mobile unit number 4. 1 called any station on the

Bic, that could cali the police department, ond tell them that they (number 4 and the whita
futatang) was heading east on Summer Avenue. Now thie station right hemansvered, evidently ‘
kumied cut to ba this fellow right here, number 2 station. He caue back to me and he 4
‘stated that he was on tha telophone calling the police. X asked this fellow in number 4 t
‘his location again, and at the same particélar time, I called out if there wera any mobile *
units on Summer, or any other place near by that could pull over a police car, at almost iD
the very instant, after I completed my broadcast, unit number one came back and said he

had’ a police car in sight, but be did not tell me the location. I thought he was near Alano
Plaza, but apparently he wasn't , I later found out that he was at Hollywood and Jackson.”

To further quote Hr. Satchfield, he stated " at that particular time, .I looked at the metax
on sy radio and it was reading 8.6, which indicated to me that it was a heck of a strong
otation, It was strong, clear, like you had a D104 mike with a pre-amp. ( note; a Di&o4 sike_
4n a brand nae for a desk mike used to broadcast with, and is considered the beat,A pre-amp
isi # éupplement added. to the gadio, to increase the pover output or modulation ) The number
4 unit would not say anything, unless he was asked a specific question, and then he would
give an answer. When this-number 4 unit got to Summer and Highland, I told Andy Anderson
that something's wrong here, because -the. signal stremth on the number 4 unit was sonstant
clear, no noise what so ever. If this had been a mobile unit, and was going east on Summer
- Avénue, his signal strength'would become less, and there would be noise from the mobile unit. =< |
'. £ continued to call thie number 4 unit to get his different locations and from the locations

that he was ‘giving me, and the time element that it took him to go from one point to another
Y point, just could not be, he was moving too fast." . ted

Lasked Mr. Satchfiéld to describe What the voice of number four sounded like, and he stated
“ig sounded like some xeal smart, exceptionally high-Q child, that had been hearing the
Broderick Crawford TV program and several other patrol typé programs and was just brillant
eodugh at that dge, to concock something of this nature, not with a formular, but just
routine watter, his voice was young, it was a shallow voice, high-pitched, youthful sounding
voica, it didn’t have any power behind it, like a older man would have, the frequency of his
voice, was quite on the ghih side, Ike a child from the age of-15'to 18 years old, with hig
voice just on the verge of changing. The studio, or room, in which he was operating ‘from
vas just as dead silent, as 1f he was completely sealed off from everything else. There wasnt
my music, ao sound of other people in the room, no sound of a police monitar, just as clear -.
as ££ he were broadcasting in the room by himself. There was no detectién of noise from his
signal what~so-aver.” .

3a was aoked that ££ @ man had a halicrafe receiver with-no transmitter, and the party listendg
to the halicarét radio, could hear the mobile unit at Hollywood and Jackson, could hear his = *
gtation which {6 at Union and Cooper and the third station at Tanglewood’ and Southera, but
yaa unable to have a clear copy on the mobile that was chasing the mustang at all times, could
ho explain that? He stated that it was possible that the station that claimed to be the
s sobile chasing the white mustang, was ao close to the halicraft receiver, that At was over-
loading the halicraft radio, causing too mich power in-put, which would distort the halicrafe
rocaiver. . .

ae .
‘for talking with Mx. Satehfield, I contacted Mr. Green at Armour Radio Station, and after-——~
ilscussing this matter with him and bringing him up. to date in what I had found out in
reference to the halicraft receiver and the possibility that the CB Unit could be so close
to it, that 12 overloaded tho halicrafter receiver, he stated. that this could and does happen
snd also stated that the CB unit would bleed over onto televisions, in some cases, completely
wutting tho audio and etso onto, regular AM, Stero, High-Fi and Anplifters uaed. by guitarists 7

Iftar receiving the above information, I took # city.map of Memphis and outlined the area
around the halicrafter rectiver, bounded on the west by North Highland on the nath by Summer .
\venue, on the east by Craham, and on the south by Walnut Grove Rd. I then took a ruler

and using the scale of miles on the city’map, I measured from the halicraft receiver to
jJollywood and Jackson, vhera the mobile, CB, unit with car 160, and found that it was 2 and k

She then tavited ma into Eddia’s room to check his radio stating that bhe knew nothing of
tha radio, and that maybe 1f I lookad I could get tha information that 1 neaded without
waiting for Edd{a to coma homa. I found that the pavento of Eddia had convarted the attic
into a room for Eddie and it contained the usual bedroom furniture along with a ham radio
sat; and a CB radio set. She said that Eddie had been fooling with radios: since he waa

14 yeard old.and that he was now 17 years old and went on to complain about the expense of
the Lobby, sha told ma to go uhaad and eurn the radio an and check it all I wanted to,
and thia I did. 1 found that this radio contained 23 channels and had a D104 mike, It

{3 also. to ba noted at this time, that this room io in an attic completely away from tha

pravioualy otated and in checking hie radio out, wa found that he had a reading of 8.0.

After checking this radio, I made an appoint/*. with Mr. Satchfield and Mr. McCarty the
owner of the halicraft raceivar, for 4100 PM, April 15, 1968 and we would attempt to gat

December 2, 1977

At approximately 3:00 p.m., November 21, 1977,
Special Agent (SA) William R. Duncan was intervicwed by
Mrs. Sheila Lee and Mr. Michael Everhart, Attorneys for
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, at the U. S.
House of Representatives, Annex Number Two, Washington, D.G

SA Duncan was told his name came up as having made an
offer in the Louisville Police Department to kill Dr. Martin
Luther King in 1965. Duncan told them he was assigned to the
Louisville Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
from February, 1952, until May, 1967, and had responsibilities
ag Liaison Agent with the Louisville Police Department during
most of this period.

The allegation involved an incident which allegedly
took place at a roll-call tisie in the First District Office
sometime in the fall of 1965. Reportedly making the allega-
tion was Clifton Baird, white male, 50, a retired Louisville
police officer who retired in 1975 after 27 years of ervice.
Also present was Chief of Detectives, Major Robert Gregory,
Captain Priest M. Fry, formerly Chief of Detectives and possibly
the Captain of the First District; Lieutenant James Bibb, a
uniformed First District Lieutenant; Sergeant Brent Nardin, a
Third District Sergeant; possibly Herman Mitchell, Homicide
Squad; Licutenant Vernon Austin; and possibly Robert E. Peters
(SA), formerly of the Louisville Division of the PBI.

he related that in late March or early April, 1977, he received
in the FBI mail an Associated Press clipping about a Clifton

an offer to kill pr. Martin Luther King. ‘The clipping cane
in the regular PBI mail and Duncan ‘stated he did not know who
sent it to him.

A few days later, while on the phone to ex-FBI Supervisor
Robert E. Peters in Louisville regarding a social engagement,
Duncan asked him about the clipping and who Clifton Baird was
and what the clipping referred to. Peters said Baird was a
tall, heavy-set man who was in the Vice Squad for a while and
that Duncan should have known him from seeing him in the Vice
irae while Duncan worked with the Detective Bureau in Louis-
ville.

Approximately April 25, 1977, FBI Headquarters sent a
aommunication to Lovisvilie and St.‘ Louis FBI Offices request-
ing the pregent locations ef former Special Agent in Charge of
Louisville, Bernard C. Brown; Supervisor Robert E. Peters;
and SA William R. Duncan as they were named by former Police
Officer Clifton Baird alleging impropridtics in the Martin
Luther King assassination case.

SA Duncan initially had no recollection of the incident
and he called former SA Peters at Louisville and asked him if,
he knew anything about this. Peters repliea@ that he had no
ideas Duncan later called retired Police Captain John Rampton
of Louisville, a. close personal friend, to determine if he
knew anything about this. Hampton advised he did not know
but would ask and find out what he could and call Duncan. He
later called back ani gave the names of some police officers
who had been interviewed and named former Major Priest M. Fry;
former Major Robert Gregory; Lieutenant James Bibb; Sergeant
Brent Hardin and Lieutenant Vernon Austin. Hampton apparently
talked to Austin and advised that he had learned that the event
was supposed to have taken place in the First District Offices
sometime in 1964 or 1965. Duncan called Lieutenant Vernon
Austin, whom he had known for 25 years, and asked him about the
matter. Austin related to Duncan who the Committec had asked
about and generally who was supposed to be present when the
alleged offer took place.

Duncan told the investigators that he had no recollection
concerning this matter and that he had in fact not slept and ~
walked the floor a number of nights for approximately ten days
to two weeks. At this time he recalled one night that Sergeant
Willian Baker of the First District Vice dquad met hin in the

second floor hallway sometime in the afternoon and asked
Duncan to help him with a joke with a couple of officers

at the First District. Duncan was told to go te the roll-call
at roll-call time and say that he had heard that there wasa
$250,000 or $500,000 reward for the death of Dr. Martin Luther -
King and was to add to or verify something that had already
.been said. Duncan recalled going down to the area and making
the general statement that he had heard that there was a
$250,000 or $500,000 price on Dr. Martin Luther King from
either the Ku Klux Klan or the Communist Party. Duncan added
iff verification was wanted, one should contact Bob Peters or
B. C. Brown of the FBI.

Duncan did not recall who was there except several
uniformed officers who were coming and going and that there
were several in the area. There were a number of questions
regarding whether it was a big roll-call area or the Captain's,
Sergeant's, Lieutenant's offices or a hallway. Duncan was
asked whether or not there were three or a dozen people present
and Duncan replied that there could have been between three
and twelve people, exact number unrecalled.

Duncan was asked whether Bob Peters was there. Duncan
said he did not recall his being there, otherwise he would
not have made the statement that “if you want to vérify the
pricé on Dr. Martin Luther King contact Bob Peters or B. C.
Brown." Duncan identified one person he thought was there as
Arlie Blaire (because Duncan had heard that he was supposed to
have been thete from the questions asked). Duncan recalled a

» younger, red-haired officer with a crew-cut or brush-cut.
Duncan said he had talked to Blaire and possibly his partner
in connection with a fugitive murder case that Duncan was
working.

Duncan was asked about his relationship with Robert Peters
and also with Fry, Hardin, Gregory, Bibb, Austin, Herman
Mitchell, John Mitchell and-B. C. Brown of the FBI.

The Committee Investigators apparently could not under-
stand why Duncan. could not remember who was at the meeting.
They asked Duncan about an attempted bombing of Sergeant Brent
Hardin's car and if Duncan worked on the case. Duncan recalled
a bomb being placed on Hardin's car but that it apparently did
not go off. Duncan recalled it was possibly in connection with

an election regarding some of the police organizations.
Dunean did not recall whether the FBI worked on the case
at all other than to offer the FBI Laboratory facilities;
however, Duncan did not work on the bombing of the car.

Duncan was asked about the Louisville Chapter of the
Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and if it was a racist or a--
white-hate group. Duncan replied he did not know, but he
did receive a plaque ani an honorary life-time membership
in the Louisville Chapter of the FOP for cooperation with
the Louisville Police Department when he transferred from
Louisville in 1967 and that this plaque was signed by Lieu-
tenant Leo Joseph, then secretary and also secretary to the
Chief of netectives.

Duncan was asked if the Ku Klux Klan was active in
Louisville and if any FBI Agents or Louisville Police Officers
belonged, Duncan replied that he had little knowledge of the
Ru Klux Klan at that time. He heard in later years after he
left Louisville that it did become active in Kentucky.

At this point the investigators requested Duncan to wait
awhile. Subsequently they came. back and took Duncan to
another room and introduced Duncan to Mr. Edward M. Evans, ;
Chief Investigator for the Committee, and Mr. Robert J. Lehner,
Deputy Chief Counsel for the Committee. They then asked some
of the same questions, including who was at the alleged meeting.

Mx. Lehner said that the Louisville ‘Police Officers were
"stonewalling" the issue and maybe when they were put under
oath they would recall some of the incident. There were sone
questions asked of Duncan such as did Duncan know black officer
Virgil White ani a John Mitchell. Duncan recalled that he was
acquainted with Virgil White; who was a Vice Squad Detective,
but did not recall John Mitchell, but did recall petective
Herman Mitchell.

Duncan was asked if he knew Dr. King and Mr. Hoover's
relationship and Duncan said no, except what he had heard in
the newspaper and other media sources.

Duncan was asked if he mew Dr. Martin Luther King and
Dunean replied that he never recalled seeing him in person;
Duncan was asked if he knew King's brother, the Reverend A. D.
Williams Xing who lived in Louisville. He was told that Duncan

met him in 1963 with the then-Special Agent in Charge when Duncan
was to drive them and Attorney Gen>ral Robert F. Kennedy, when

: Kennedy came to Louisville to speak to a group on the 100th
Anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.
Duhean met Rev. A. D. Williams King with the Special Agent in
Charge at his church as he met everyone else who was to appear
on the platform with Attorney General Kennedy as Duncan wanted
to be personally acquainted with everyone on the platform.

Duncan was asked if he knew Aaron Duke, Arlie Blaire's
partner, and Duncan replied that he did not recall him.

SEREEDNSOEEE Duncan was asked if he had been the subject of any dis-
ciplinary action as a result of this matter and he replied
that he had not.

Duncan was asked if he had brought this incident to the
attention of any of his supervisérs and, if so, when. Duncan
replied that it was brought to the attention of SA Danny Oo.
Coulson, FBIHQ, when he knew that he was to he called to the
committee for interview.

punean was asked if he ever surveilled Dr. King and if
he knew of any telephone taps regarding Dr. King. Duncan
replied that he did not surveil him and he had no personal
knowledge of any telephone taps,

Duncan was asked if he thought the matter was a joke
and if he could see anything funny in it and Duncan replied
that at the time it was meant as a joke, but at the present
time it was'a most serious and stupid thing, particularly in
light of events subsequent to 1965. Duncan stated he would
take a polygraph examination to verify that what he was saying
was true. |

Duncan was asked if he knew that Dr. King was a frequent
visitor in Louisville during the racially troubled period.
We advised that he recalled the racially troubled times really
climazed after 1967. Duncan was. asked if he would know Arlie
Blaire's voice and Duncan replied he did not think he would.

Dunean was then told that he was to appear before the
Sub-Committee to give sworn testimony on November 30, 1977,
and would a subpoena be necessary. Duncan advised a subpoena’
would not be necessary. Duncan was given the phone number
of the Committee and told to contact Mr. Everhart should he
recall anything else.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS,
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAN

_On November 29, 1977, Duncan again contacted Committee
Staff Members Mrs. Sheila Lee, Mx. Michael Everhart and Mr.
William !"sbb.

Duncan told them that he had recalled that he might have
known Aaron Duke, Arlie Blaire's partner. Duncan recalled a
person described as a white male, in his late 30's or early
40's as of 1965 or 1966, stocky, not fat, with gray cropped
hair, approximately 5' 16" and 180-185-190 pounds.

Punean advised that he had no first-hand knowledge of
Dr. King and Mr. Hoovér's difficulty but that he had heard
rumors. about it and had a faint recollection that he may have
mentioned this at the time he told of the Ku Mux Klan and/or
the Communist Party rumor in the First District Police area.

Duncan told them that he did not tell someone of his
recollection as a joke earlier because when the communication
was received from the Burenu, it was pointed out that he would
be contacted regarding the matter by the Committee Investiga-—
tors and that he would at that time be briefed by legal personnel
from FBIHQ.

Duncan was asked if he had discussed this matter with
anyone outside the Bureau and his family. Punean told then
hé had talked one time with Liewtenant Vernon Austin by phone
and he did not discuss the joke other than ask if it could .
have been a joke. Duncan told them he had discussed it with
Robert Peters at least on three occasions. Once when it came
to his attention from a newspaper clipping, once when he re~
xveived a communication from FBI Headquarters, and one time after
he realized that it was a joke, at which time he told Peters
that he (Peters) and B. C. Brown had nothing to do with it.
Duncan was asked about their get-together for the football
game on November 11-12, 1977. Duncan told them that Duncan
and Peters seriously considered not getting together for this
year's football game but decided since they had known each
other for 25 years and had plans to attend this football game
for over a year, that they would go ahead and get together,
They agreed not to discuss the matter, however.

_Duncan also told them that when he realized that it was
a joke and that he was involved, he contacted a long-time
personal friend and lawyer to assist in the analysis and action
regarding the entire matter.

The Investigaters asked if Dunean would be represerted
by Counsel before the Committee and Duncan replied ha would
not.

On the night of November 29, 1977, Duncan went back to
‘tthe Washington National Airport to pick up his luggage.
While there, a flight from Louisville came in and he saw
his long-time friend, P. M. Fry, with whom he shook hands.
Accompanying Fry was Lieutenant James Bibb whom Duncan did
not recall for a mimite, and former Police Officer Arlie
Blaire. Blaire came up to Duncan and at this time was
recognized as being a former Louisville Police Officer. At
this time SA DUNCAH realized BLAIRE was not the ‘red~headed
person he thought that he had remembered at the First District
Office. Blaire volunteéred to Duncan that he knew Duncan only
professionally and that he had been discharged for being an
alcoholic, that he had cured himself without going to Alto-
holics Anonymous and he was there at the request of the -
Committee. He was asked by Dunean if he ever recalled working
on the Nashan Lane murder case. He did recall this. He was
asked what his partner, Aaron Duke, looked Like and he gave
a description meeting the one Duncan had recalled. He also
advised that they rode in cat 102 rather than car 101.

airport meeting to the attention of Mr. Michael Everhart and
Mr. Edward Evans of the Committee staff.

Brent Hardin, Arlie Blaire, Clifford Baird, Herman Mitchell,
Robert I. Peters, B. C,. Brown and Warren Walsh. He gave
them a similar reply as he had given the Investigators. He
told them that he did not recognize or know Clifton Baird
for sure until he saw him coming out of the Committee room
on November 30, 1977. -

He was asked if he knew a Sergeant William Baker and
if he was known to pull jokes. Duncan said "yes". He was
asked if he knew any of the jokes pulled by Baker, He re-+
lated one of Baker's pranks that he allegedly pulled on some~
one with the Louisville Ministerial Alliance.

Duncan was asked if he ever pulled any jokes and the
answer was "on occasion", and he gave one example. Ne was
asked in great detail about where the meeting or joke was

- pulled and how he was to know who he was to tell the story
to. Dunzan did not recall except that he thought there vere
two officers from the district and unjoubtedly one of them
would have been Baird, otherwise Baird would not have told
the story. He was asked how the statement was made and if
there was anything else said. Duncan replied that there couli
have been a question asked and he could have replied something
about Mr. Hoover and Dr. King's relationship. 7

He was asked about the racial climate in Louisville and
replied that he thought it was fairly calm until after 1967.
He also pointed out that the Louisville City School System
was one of the few in the United States that was integrated
without incident but that the County School System several
years later had difficulty. He was asked about Dr. Martin ©
Luther King and A. p. Williams King again. He again gave the
reply except that he had checked the newspaper accounts md
found that Dr. King, according to the newspaper accounts, was_
in Louisville three times between 1963 and 1965 and they were
May 22, 1963, at the Convention Center; May 16, 1965, when
he was at the Zion Baptist Church, his brother's church;
and again on December 16, 1965, at the Zion Baptist Church when
he spoke to the Kentucky NAACP Group on civil rights.

He was again asked about Dr. King and Hr. Hoover's trouble
and if Dr. Ring was surveilled every time he came to a town
and who put the telephone taps on him. Further, if they hal
people from Louisville or people that went around the country
putting on telephone taps on Dr. King. Duncan replied that
he had no knowlkedge of any surveillances or any telephone taps
on Dr. King.

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAN

He was asked if he ever was a supervisor, cither in
Louisville or St. Louis, if he had worked on the bombing
of Sergoant Brent Hardin's car, and if he worked on a civil
rights case concerning Clifton Baird. Dutican replied nega-
tively to all these questions.

Duncan was given a statement which allegedly was a trans-
cription of a recording between Arlie Blaire and Clifton Baird
which discussed blacks and King in derogatory terms, and there
were soma references made to an offer. He was asked if this
was typical of the Louisville Police feelings at that time.

He alvised that he did not know and that he had never heard
this discussed. The transcription was signed by Clifton Baird
on November 30, 1977, and the recording was supposed to lave
taken place on September 20, 19€5.

Duncan was asked if he knew about the assassination of
Malcolm X and he replicd that he had probably heard about it,
He thought it was a Black Maskim killing in Chicage. Hews
told that it was a Black Muslim killing in New York.

He was asked about the Louisvilla Division's participa~
tion in the Cointelpro. Duncan advised that he had no know-
ledge of any program, pointing out that he was a Criminal In-
vestigative Agent. He was asked who handled racial type inves-
tigations in Louisville and if he had informants. Duncan ad-
vised him that Warren Walsh formerly handled these kind of
matters and he was then asked if George Hutchison also worked
these cases. Duncan replied "yes", but that he did not know
Walsh's informants but undoubtedly he did have informants.

Duncan was questioned by Committee mombers. and askel
generally what guidelines he hai been given by the FBI to answer
questions. He replied that he was given complete clearance to
discuss any matter concerning the Dr. Martin Luther Ring matter.
He was asked concerning the description of Sergeant Bill Baker.
Duncan told the Committee mombers that he was instructed by
the FBI to tell the truth at all costs.

Duncan was asked how many times he made the “offer" or
the statement and was it made on more than one occasion and
on two different dates. Duncan replied that he only recalled
the one time ani the one date. Mr. Sawyer made the remark that
he had the unpleasant experience to be present to hear the late
: Parga aapd J. Edgar Hoover say some very bitter thinys regarding
Dr. King.

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAT

Dunean was asked if he thought that the incident was
an offer by the FBI to kill pr. King, Duncan replied that
it definitely wag not. However, it was in poor taste and
something that should not have occurred, He vas.asked- his
definition of a joke and Dungan gave his definition of a joke
as something made in fun. He was asked several tires regard~
ing the anonymous novspaper clipping suddenly appearing in the
PBI mail, and was this not a crack-pot way of doing things.

He added that Congressmen frequently receive anonymous items
in the mail also.

tr, Stokes asked if SA DUNCAN knew that Dr. King had won
the Wobel Peace Prize and that he preached peace wherever he
wont. Duncan replied he did know, but did not know the date.
Mr. Stokes stated that he thought the American public should
hear and judge this matter.

Duncan was asked where he was acsigned and where he was
physically the date that pr. King was killed. He replied he
was assigned to the St. Louis Division and at the Mexico,
Missouri; Resident Agency.

Mr. Everhart of the staff summed up the questioning. by
asking if it was possible that P. M. Fry, Vernon Austin,
Robert Gregory, Brent Hardin, Herman Mitchell, Arlie Blaire,
and Robert Peters could have been present when the matter was
discussed regarding Dr. King. Duncan replied that it was pos-
sible, but he had no recollection of any of them, especially
Peters,

SA Duncan acknowledged limited participation as described
in instant incident, but stated this was done on his own ini-
tiative spontaneously and wanted it known the FBI as an organi-
zation had no involvement whatsoever. Further, that Re would
cooperate fully in resolving this matter satisfactorily.

Mr. Lehner requested Duncan not to contact .any of the
police officers or discuss his testimony with any of then.

I think it appropriate at this time that I=

‘express my thanks to you and to those on your staff

who have greatly facilitated the course of the Select
Committee's investigation. Mr. Robert Keuch in particular
has‘ been an outstanding liaison with the Select Committee.
His efforts in negotiating our Memorandum of Understanding
with the Department of Justice and in expediting our
requests for immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 88 6002 and
6005 are greatly appreciated. During the time period

when he was in the hospital, he took great care to insure
that the Committee's business was in no way interrupted.

The cooperation we are receiving from Mr. -
Keuch, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and other ‘persons and departments within the Department :
of Justice, is significantly assisting the Select Committee
in the fulfillment of its legislative mandate. The Select’ -.._
Committee and its staff recognizes the efforts that have
been expended, and wish to thank you for them.

House Select Committee on Assassinations

Eberhardt then asked if Brown knew Louisville
Police Officers: Baird ~ no answer; Gregory ~ yes, he was a
captain, a National Academy graduate, and attended the regional
National Academy retraining, session in Atlanta in 1965. We
have attended commanding officers dinners from time to time
since then; Brent Hardin - yes, as an active Fraternal Order
of Police President and outspoken advocate of increased
salaries and benefits for officers =~ socially, Brown has had
no contact; Bibb ~ no; Priest Fry - yes, as Chief of Detectives
of Louisville Police Department.

Eberhardt then asked if Brown knew retired Special
Agent Robert Peters to which he replied that he had known him
since Brown's arrival in the Louisville Office. How often has
he seen him? About once a month, socially, was his reply.

When did Brown see Bill Duncan last? Brown replied,
“briefly about two or three years ago, as Brown arrived at a
be a funetion dust as Duncan was departing for his home in
Missouri.

Was Dunean one to pull practical jokes? Brown
responded “he didn't know." He had no social contact with him
while he was Special Agent in Charge, except at office parties.
In the office, he was strictly business.

Ms. Lee asked 1f Bob Peters had been handling
civil rights cases while Brown was in charge. Brown replied
that Peters was handling criminal cases at that time, to the
best of his recollection.

She then asked if the Louisville Office had received
any information to the effect that Martin Luther King might be
assassinated. He replied that it had not, but that had such
information reached the office, it bien have been relayed at
once to the Bureau.

She next asked if there had been much Ku Klux Klan
activity in Kentucky while he was Special Agent in Charge.
Brown replied that he recalled none.

Ms. Lee then asked if he had ever heard Duncan or
Peters discussing racial situations. Brown replied that he had
not.

That concluded the interview and the attorneys departed
at 9:50 p.m. No mention was made of a subpoena for Brown to

appear in Washington.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON _ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

On November 15, 1977, Special Agent (SA) Thomas
L. Colarelli was interviewed by -HSCA Staff Attorneys Mark
Speiser and Peter Beeson specifically regarding interviews
conducted by SAs Colarelli and Patrick Collins in New Orleans
in April, 1968, in connection with the Martin Luther King
assassination, and in general, about organized erime matters
in Louisiana.

The interviewSin question were of Vincent, Anthony
and Emma Liberto, 2211 Almonaster, New Orleans, in April,
1968,. concerning Frank Liberto in the produce business in
Memphis, Tennessee, Emma's son, and the brother of Vincent
and Anthony regarding some disparaging remark Frank allegedly
made about King. -

Agent could not recall these interviews even after
being presented with copies of same to read.

Speiser and Beeson wanted to know of any known
organized crime ties the Libertos had with Carlos Marcello's
family in New Orleans, none of which is known by the Agent
to the best of his recollection. Agent observed, however,
that Carlos Marcello was a paid salesman for Pelican Tomato
Company and perhaps someone could conclude that in view of
this there may have been an association with him and the
Libertos. Further, whether any organized crime figure in
Louisiana had known ties to or membership in white supremist
groups, which was also unknown to the Agent.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to.
your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed out-

They further inquired as to whether or not there
were any Negro Agents assigned in New Orleans at the time
and what the general racial attitude was of the Agents in
the office at the time. As far as Agent knows, there were
no Negro Agents in New Orleans at the time and the Agent
never to the best of his recollection heard any Agent voice
anything which would indicate a racial prejudice.

Staff Attorneys asked Agent if he recognized
numerous names as being related to organized crime in
Louisiana, most of which were unknown to Agent, -except
prominent gambling figures like Sai Dipiazza, who was
convicted by the New Orleans Division during that time
period.

Agent was asked specifically for a chart of the
Marcello LCN family and whether Marcello had ties in
Shreveport and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Agent referred
them to the Bureau files either in New Orleans or Washington,

_ D, C. regarding LCN membership as Agent could not recall

NW 55050

with any specificity or accuracy the identity of any LCN
member except Carlos Marcello.

The names of Ernest Palmisano in Shreveport and
Frank Buic of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were mentioned by
Agent from recollection as individuals known to have or
alleged to have association with Marcello in the past in
these areas.

Agent was asked if he knew Arron Cohn, Charles
Stien (phonetic) or first name unknown Pecot, a New Orleans
Police Officer. Agent acknowledged knowing only Cohn to
the best of his recollection as the then Director of the
Metropolitan Crime Commission. Several questions were asked
concerning Cohn's background, reliability, credibility and
trustworthiness which Agent responded to by limiting it to
his own contacts with Cohn as a source of information during
that time period.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE 4
ON_ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA) :

Staff Attorneys wanted to know if Agent knew State
Policeman Raoul Escabell (phonetic) who was then a member of
the First Intelligence Unit of the Louisiana State Police
and also generally the degree of cooperation between the New
Orleans Office and the various local Intelligence Units in
that area. Agent acknowledged knowing Escabell and could not
comment other than to say that his dealings with him and
others in Intelligence Units amongst the local authorities was
excellent at the time.

The thrust of the interrogatives implied that
organized crime figures in Louisiana would have a ulterior
motive in suppressing the blacks; and therefore, would have
reason to want King killed so as to eliminate his influence
on them. Agent observed that he knew of no conflict in
interest between the Italian criminal element and the blacks
in Louisiana similar to those evident in the Northeastern
states.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

On November 16, 1977, SA Ramon W. Stratton of
the Portland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) was interviewed at House Annex Number 2 by Mr. William
A. Webb and Mr. Michael C. Eberhardt, members of the
House Select Committee on Assassinations investigating
the assassination of Dr. Martin. Luther King, Jr.

The interview with SA Stratton related to
investigations conducted by the Chicago Field Division
of the FBI to which SA Stratton was assigned at that time.
No written memorandum was furnished to SA Stratton to
refresh his recollection.

Many of the questions centered around the
possibility that Jerry Ray, brother of James Earl Ray,
may have been involved in a conspiracy to assassinate
Dr. King. The Chicago Field Division of the FBI established
that on April 3 and 4, 1968 (the latter being the date of
assassination of Dr. King), Jerry Ray was gainfully
employed and present in the vicinity of Chicago, Illinois.

Many of the questions of the Committee counsel
had to do with why the FBI did certain things and did not
do other things; however, SA Stratton was unable to answer
most of their questions due to the passage of time since
the investigation took place and the lack of any memoranda
to refresh his recollection.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your
