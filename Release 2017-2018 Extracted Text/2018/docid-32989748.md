December 14, 1977

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

On December 6, 1977, Special Agent (SA) Stephen

M. Callender of the New. Orleans Office of the federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was interviewed by

Peter G. Beeson, Mark A. Speiser, and Lisa Berlow, Staff

Counsel of the HSCA.

The questioning related to the investigation

conducted by the New Orleans Office of the FBI regarding the

assassination of Martin Luther King.

In response to their initial questions; they were

informed that SA Callender has been a Special Agent of the

FBI since August, 1951 and that he has been

assigned to the

New Orleans FBI Office since December, 1961.

SA Callender

was assigned a case involving the assassination of Martin

Luther King within the New Orleans FBI Office. His main

duties as case

agent were the handling of the "paper"

involving the investigation.

This included reading and

reviewing all incoming and outgoing communications,

assisted in assigning of leads, review all investigation

conducted to be sure that it was complete and thorough.

Joseph I. Sylvester, Jr., in April, 1968, was the Assistant

Agent in Charge of the New Orleans

Office of the FBI and was

overall in charge of the investigation conducted by New

Orleans.

SA Callender probably was assigned the case by

Mr. Sylvester?

inasmuch as SA Callender was working on

Mr. Sylvesten's squad.

This squad, among other things,

handled Civil Rights and related matters, SA Callender had

worked for Sylvester for better than six years and had experience

in the handling of "paper" on other major investigations:

ON ASSASSINATIONS

In addition, the Staff Counsel was provided with administrative

data relating to the normal procedures in opening and

assigning a case as well as the handling of leads and

reporting procedures and the closing of cases.

In response to their questions, they were informed

that SA Callender had not reviewed the Martin Luther King

assassination file in New Orleans prior to this interview

and had not conversed with anyone regarding the interview

before the "Staff Counsel", other than with

a Bureau official,

on December 6, 1977 prior to the interview.

They were informed that the last time

SA Callender

had thoraghly reviewed the King assassination file in New

Orleans was possibly eight or nine years ago.

There would

have been no reason since that time to thoroughly review this

That within the past six months, small portions of

the New Orleans file had been reviewed

to locate specific

communications which were to be sent to FBI Headquarters,

Washington, D.C., upon instructions of the Department of

Justice, as a

result of a court order being issued in another

matter

involving King.

It was apparent. from the ensuing questions of the

Staff Counsel that they were

attempting to determine and were

looking for a possible

conspiracy in the assassination of

King in the investigation conducted by New Orleans.

The Staff Counsel initially pointed out that there

was a memorandum in the New Orleans file that a woman, whose

name was set forth (name not recalled by SA Callender),

reportedly had some information about the King assassination,

but was not to be contacted

as she was a friend of District

Attorney Jim Garrison.

Upon response to questions, SA Callender informed

that to the best of his recollection, former District Attorney

Jim Garrison of Orleans Parish, New Orleans, had not

conducted an investigation into

the assassination of King,

that instructions had been

received from Bureau Headquarters

not to have any contact with Garrison prior to the

assassination.

claims that his investigation into the assassination of President

Kennedy had determined there was a conspiracy and the results

of his

investigation were at odds with the conclusions of the

Warren Commission. It was SA Callender's recollection that

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

-ON ASSASSINATIONS

Garrison was critical of the FBI's investigative efforts

in the assassination of President Kennedy.

They were

informed that it had been SA Callender's experience that

the FBI would not share sources or informants with other

agencies and that Garrison's cooperation in the King

investigation had not been

solicited.

In response to their questions, they were

informed that Kent Courtney was in the newspaper business

and that his political reputation was that of a

The Staff Counsel then informed that

information supplied to them indicated that Kent Courtney

of Alexandria, Louisiana, had contacted the New Orleans

FBI Office sometime after the assassination and informed

that he was going to interview the brother of James Earl

Ray and this brother was going to supply information

relating to a conspiracy.

Courtney desired an FBI Agent

to be present during this interview.

According to this

memorandum, Courtney was advised an FBI Agent would not be

present and that he should contact the District Attorney's

Office at Memphis, Tennessee regarding this proposed

interview.

The Staff Counsel also indicated that there were

instructions from the Bureau Headquarters that Courtney was

not to be contacted.

In response to their questions, they were informed

that the reason

Courtney was referred to the District Attorney's

It has been SA Callender's experience that the

Bureau's policy in

dealing with the press in those days was

formulated at Washington, D.C. and for the most part,

controlled from Bureau Headquarters and especially in a

matter involving the magnitude of the King investigation.

They indicated they had received information that a person

with the first name of Kent (last name unknown) attended

a Ku Klux Klan function at Alexandria, Louisiana and were

informed that to the best of SA Callender's recollection,

Kent Courtney had not ever been identified as a Klan member.

In response to their questions, they were informed that

Klan groups active in Louisiana at the time of the king

assassination were the Original Knights of the Ky Klux Klan,

the United. Klans of America, and the Original Knights of

the Ku Klux Klan of the 6th

District. The Silver Dollar

Group was a Klan type organization around the Vidalia-

It was not recalled if this group

was associated with the UKA or the Minutemenn or was a

separate organization.

No information had been developed regarding

passible involvement of organized crime in this matter.

The name of Frank. Liberte was not familiar at this time.

It was recalled by SA Callender that there had been a

conversation between two men in Memphis who were in the

produce business which apparently was derogatory in

nature regarding King. As a result, an interview had

been conducted of an individual in New Orleans who was

in the produce business.

That Willard Robertson was

That attempts were made to identify "Raoul",

on the Louisiana State Police Force by the first name of

Raoul had been located and interviewed, however, the results

of the interview were not recalled.

investigated by the FBI in Louisiana.. It could not be

recalled if investigation was conducted at the Wallace

Campaign Headquarters in New Orleans to determine if Ray

had been conducted.

That bars in the 400 and 500 block of Canal Street

to various organizations and that in the past, Klan meetings

have been held at this meeting hall.

A group known as "Truth or Consequences" was

formed by New Orleans businessmen to raise money for

Jim Garrison to conduct his investigation into the

Kennedy assassination.

That Cecil Shilstone is a self-employed New

Orleans businessman who had been publicly identified as

a member of Truth or Consequences.

and his attorney

appeared at the New Orleans Office and informed that a rumor

was going around the New Orleans business community

that shilstone allegedly was a New Orleans industrialist

who Ray reportedly came to New Orleans to contact and

get money.

That Shilstone emphatically denied this

allegation and that he was not involved in any manner

or could he supply any information relating to the

King assassination.

That all informants and sources in the New

Orleans Division were contacted regarding James Earl

Ray in an effort to determine if Ray was known or had

any association

with any white hate groups or black

extremist organization.

That it could not be recalled what investigation

may have been conducted at Denham Springs, Louisiana,

regarding a remark allegedly made sometime prior to the

assassination that a collection ought to be taken up to

get somebody to shoot king.

To SA Callender's

recollection, there was no

and that there was no

negro agents assigned to this

office

at the time of the king investigation.

In addition,

the "Staff Counsel" mentioned several names of persons,

however, these names mentioned were not familiar to SA

Callender at this time.

The enclosures refer to investigation conducted

relative to referenced matter as it appeared to refer to

captioned matter.

The Bureau's attention is directed to the fact

the Ece does not have an office in the Memphis area; however,

an official'of the Memphis PD did contact a representative

of the FCC at Atlanta, Ga., to report this incident. No

inquiry has been received by the Memohis PD or this office

from FCC relative to this referenced incident and therefore

it appears FCC is not interested in a CB radio transmission.

Concerning the possibility of interviewing other

individuals contacted

it is pointed out no attempt was made

• to interview these individuals due to the investigation

conducted by the Memphis: PD and due to the lack of evidence

RE: ALLEGED CHASE OF WHITE MUSTANG,

indicated:

• On the evening of April 4, 1ybo, alter there nac

been traffic on the Police Department cadio in Memphis with

regard to a white Mustang reportedly seen leaving the scene

of the shooting of Dr. KING; there was

additional traffic on

the police radio concerning an alleged'incident involving an

unknown

citizens band (CB) radio operator who reported

that he

was chasing a white Mustang occupied by three white males,

this unknown operator never identifying himself: but continuing

to broadcast up to a point where he claimed that the chase

had reached a point. north of Raleigh, Tennessee, a suburb

Memphis.

On April 6, 1968, Inspector N. E. ZACHARY, Homicide

Bureau, Memphis Police Department, furnished the following

information with regard to this incident:

Inspector ZACHARY secured a tape recording of the

radio dispatches made following the murder of Dr. KING On

April 1, 1968, and listened to the radio tráffic, which in

cluded dispatches with regard to a chase allegedly made by an

unknown person of a white Mustang occupied by three white

He stated

The police

dispatcher received traffic from Police Car No. 160, which.

Inspector ZACHARY determined was manned by Lieutenant RUFUS

BRADSHAW. in substance, Lieutenant BRADSIAY was transmitting

to tlie dispatcher information which he was receiving from one

individual who had a CB radio in his car, which individuni in

tu 'n was receiving transmissions from some unknow individual

transmitting on a CB radio.

: 1-50914

Inspector ZACHARY advised that on April 4,

1968; while the transmissions in question were being

made

from the unknown CB operator, Lieutenant SAN T.

received a teiephone call from an individual who identified

himself as ED CHAUNCEY, telephone number 276-0643, who

reported that he was monitoring his CB radio and overheard

an unknown operator in a mobile unit who claimed that

he was chasing a white Mustang.

Mr. CHAUNCEY at this

time advised Lieutenant MCCACIREN that he (CHAUNCEY)

was in contact with another CB operator known to him,

namely BILL AUSTEIN, and that the three CB operators,

namely the unknown operator, AUSTEIN, and CHAUNCEY, WEXe

in contact with each other,

and Mr. CHAUNCEY would supply

all information he received to the Police Department to

assist them with regard to a chase in which thesunknown

operator claimed to be involved.

Thereafter, on April 6,

1968, Lieutenant J. D. MUSIC talked bytelephone again

with

both Mr. ED CHAUNCEY at the above telephone number

•and with

Mx, AUSTEIN, both of them at that time furnishing

substantially the same information.as to what had

occurred with regard to these transmissions by an unknown

CB operator.

Inspector ZACHARY advised that Lieutenant

RUFUS BRADSHAW, Cár No. 160, had been contacted on

April 6, 1968, at which time

Lieutenant BRADSHAW had

stated that Mr. WILLIAM HUBBARD AUSTEIN, age 22, 0f

24 North Montgomery Street, Apartment 103, an employee ..

of Clendenin Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc., had

flagged down Lieutenant BRADSHAW at Jackson and Hollyvood

on the evening.of

April 4, 1968, and called Lieutenant

BRADSHAY's attention to a

broadcast being received on the

" CB radio in Mr. AUSTEIN'S automobile: Lieutenant BRADSHAW,

in turn, dispatched to the police dispatcher the nature

of the information being received on Channel 17 of the

CB radio. Lieutenant BRADSHAN listened to the CB radio

in Mr. AUSTEIN's car and heard several different CB

operators talking on Channel 17.

In substance; an unknown CB operator was

giving reports as to his chase of a white Mustang

occupied by thee whave maids.

other operators,

including fix. AUSTEIN, were attempting

to communicate

with this unknown operator, attempting to get him to

identify himself, and informing him that they would

contact the Police Department in order to assist this

unknown operator. The unknown operator, who claimed he

was chasing. the Mustang, never identified himself.

Lieutenant BRADSHAW dispatched police cars to the

areas in which the unknown CB operator claimed to be

traveling, and none of the units dispatched saw any

activity such as that described by the unknown CB

operator. Lieutenant BRADSHAW was of the definite

opinion, after the unknown person making these reports

had finally left the air, that the entire CB broadcast

by this person was a complete hoax.

Inspector ZACHARX advised, after listening to

the police dispatcher's tape recording, and after talking

to Lieutenant BRADSHAW, that there were a number of factors

to indicate that the above-mentioned broadcast on CB

Channel 17. by the unknown person was a complete hoax.

He stated that the final proof that this matter was a

complete hoax was based upon communication between the

Police Department and the Shelby County Sheriff's Office

at the time the broadcast was in progress..

After the

unknown operator reported his position as proceeding east

on Jackson Avenue toward Raleigh, Tennessee, the Police

Department immediately contacted

the Shelby County

Sheriff's Office to alert that department, which had the

responsibility for policing Raleigh, Tennessee, which is

located outside the city limits or Memphis. During the

time that this broadcast was being made, and alter the

unknown CB operator reported his position at the main

intersection at a stop light in Raleigh, Tennessee,

(Jackson Avenue and Stage Road), where the unknown

" operator claimed the Mustang had run the stop. light at

an excessive rate of speed, the Shelby County Sheriff's

Office advised the Memphis

Police Department that this

such vehicles as those described by the unknown operator

had

passed through that intersection.

Inspector ZACHARy advisod that as a result of.

a separate inquiry made by the Police Department

concerning this hoax report, he had determined that

there had been no contacts whatever between any unit

of the Memphis Police Department and the vehicles

described by the unknown person on the CB radio.

Inspector ZACHARy advised that at one point the unknown

CB operator, in response to an inquiry from another CB

operator, identified his own automobile as a 1966 blue

Pontiac.

Inspector ZACHARY pointed out that it there

had been a high speed chase of a white Mustang by a

1966 blue pontiac, then this would have attracted

attention of numerous persons, and no one, other than

the unknown CB radio operator, reported any such chase.

• Inspector ZACHARY advised that he contemplated

some additional inquiry regarding this matter in an effort

to identify the person who made this hoax report, but

insofar as the investigation of the murderer of Dr.

KING was concerned, he was certain that the chase

reported by the unknown

operator did not. occur.

On. April 10, 1968, Lieutenant J. D. HAMBX,

Homicide Bureau, Memphis Police Department; advised that

he had interviewed in detail Mc. WILLIAM HERBERT AUSTEIN;

Heating and Air Conditioning,

Inc., and at this time

Mr. AUSTEIN furnished to him the following account of

the above-mentioned incident:

Mr. AUSTEIN is a licensed CB operator, having

call letters KOM-8637, who has both a mobile unit and

a base station; the base station being located at his home

at 24 North Montgomery, Apartment 103,

in Memphis. Mr.

AUSTEIN furnished to Lieutenant HAMBY the following

information concerning an incident which occurred on the

afternoon of April 4, 1968:

He was at Zayre's Department Store on Poplar.

Avenue in Memphis until approximately 5:55 p.m., When he

Ieft that store and drove to Carlton's Esso Service Center

on the corner of Madison and Bellevue. As he arrived at

that service station, he heard the news on a commercial

radio broadcast concerning the shooting of Dr. MARTIN

LUTHER KING.

After being at thia servise station abouc

live minutes, he drove to his apartment at 24 North

Montgomery.

As nearly as he can recall; he then left

his apartment around 6:12 p.m., en route

to Steanfitters

Local 614 on Jackson Avenue near Gragg School. En route

to this location, while he was traveling east on Jackson

in the vicinity of Springdale, and at approximately

6:30 p.M., he, was monitoring CB Channel 17 when he

a mobile unit request another mobile unit to call

the Police Department by "land line" (telephone). A

base station answered the caller, telling the caller

that the base station would cali

the police,

the base

station inquiring as to the nature of the call that he

should make.: About this time, due to static, the

original caller and the base station were unable to

communicate. At this same time, AUSTEIN noticed that

the original caller who was requesting police assistance

very close to Mr. AUSTEIN's position, because there

was a very high reading on the signal strength meter

on the CB radio in Mr. AUSTEIN's car.

Mr. AUSTEIN

therefore broke into the conversation between the original

caller and the base station, telling the caller that he .

(Mr. AUSTEIN) was very close to him, that Mr. AUSTEIN had

just spotted a police car and would relay the caller's

message

to the police.

At this point, the original caller stated that

he was chasing a white Müstang east on Summer Avenue and

that the occupants of the Mustang were responsible for

DI. KING'S murder. • Mr. AUSTEIN immediately flagged down.

the police car and. thereafter talked with the Lieutenant

who was in this police car at Loeb's Barbeque at the

intersection of Jackson and Hollywood.

requested Mr. AUSTEIN to communicate again with the

unknown CB operator to determine that person's present

location. 'Mr. AUSTEIN called to this mobile unit by

i saying,

"Mobile that is chasing the white Mustang, what

is your present 10-20?" (The signal 10-20 means location.)

The original caller replied that he was approaching.

Highland on Summer Avenue at a high rate of speed.

Mx.

AUSTEIN relayed this information to the Police Lieutenant,

Who in turn relayed this information to the police

dispatcher at central police headquarters.

The Lieutenant told Mr. AUSTEIN to keep talking

to the unknown caller so that the police could be

continuously informed as to his direction and locatin

in order that the police could interpont the

AzzeErdzy Delbg chased, Mr. AusteiN lost coucace with

the mobile. unit briefly, but after calling him several

times, he finally re-established contact with him.

Mr. AUSTEIN inquired of the unknown caller

as to the description of the car that the unknown

caller was driving so that the police would be able to

easily identify the two vehicles when the police did

intercept them.

'The unknown caller responded that he

was driving a 1966 blue Pontiac and that as of that

time the white Mustang was exceeding 75 miles per. hour,

and at the same time stating that the Mustang had

turned north off Summer Avenue, the caller giving the

name of the street on which this turn was made, but

ME. AUSTEIN not recalling the name of the street as of :

the time of this interview on April. 10, 1968.

At this time there was some confusion as to

direction. that the Mustang and Pontiac were allegedly

taking.

This confusion was due in part to the fact that

some CB base station had

broken into the transmissions

and Mc. AUSTEIN could not hear the transmissions being

made by the unknown mobile unit.

The next transmission that Mr. AUSTEIN could

understand from the unknown mobile unit was to the

effect that this unit had turned north and was approaching

Raleigh (a subub northeast of Memphis) on Jackson Avenue.

Shortly after the unknown operator stated that he was-.

approaching Raleigh, that same operator stated that he

had just passed Stage Road or Austin Peay Highway and

" that

he was being fired

upon by the occupants of the white

Mustang.

The unknown caller also stated

that his speed

at that time was in excess of 100 miles per hour.

dir.

AUSTEIN asked the unknown operator to secure the license

number of the Mustang, to which the unknown operator

replied that he was afraid to get that close because

several shots had already been fired at him.

On the last transmission.of the unknown

operator,

Mr. AUSTEIN stated that this unknown operator

stated that he had 'just passed "the Millington exit"

and

the Mustang was gaining on him even though he had

the Pontiac "flat out." (Mr. AUSTEIN "iderstood that

the unknown operator was indicating that he was driving

as fast as the Pontiac would go.)

Mx. AUSTEIN called this unknown operator

several other times but received no response. He also

heard other CB operators join in, attempting to contact

this unknown operator, requesting the unknown operator

to give his call letters

and his location but he heard

no other responses and no other transmissions from this

unknown operator.

Mr. AUSTEIN stated that at the time of the

above-mentioned transmission bytther.unknown person in a

mobile CB unit, he did not recognize the voice of that

person.

He stated that he understands there are more than

3,500 licensed CB operators in Memphis and possibly that

many more who are unlicensed. He stated that whereas at

first he thought the unknown operator. was reporting a

factual situation and actually needed police assistance,

there is no doubt whatever in his mind but that the entire

transmission was a complete hoax.

He stated as the

transmissions of the unknown operator continued, he

observed that there was not sufficient time for

the two

vehicles to travel from one point where the operator

claimed to be, to some other point identified by the

unknown operator a short time later.

He also observed that during the last several

transmissions. of the unknown operator, there was no change

in the signal strength indicated on the "S-Meter" in Mr.

AUSTEIN's car, whereas if the unknown person calling had

actually been traveling

east at a high rate of speed. as

he claimed to be doing,

then the signal strength would

have become increasingly weaker. He stated it was his

judgment that the unknown person making these calls had

actually parked at the time the last few transmissions.

• Also, when the unknown operator reported that

he had turned north off Summer Avenue, his signal strength

was very weak, and a short time later when the unknown

operator was reporting that he was turning north on

Jackson Avenue, his signal strength became noticcably

stronger.

Mc: AUSTEIN explained that. what he referred to

as an "S-Meter" is an instrument on a CB radio which

indicates the relative strength of an incoming signal from

another unit.. He pointed out that when he first heard

the broadcast of the unknown caller who was asking for

police assistance, the S-Meter in his car was registering

as strong as it can register, indicating to him that

the caller may have been as close as 150 feet. from

his location and not more than two blocks away. He

. stated at the time of the last transmission of the

unknown caller, the S-Meter reading was 15 and would

indicate to him that the caller was an estimated two

miles away.

is

Mr. AUSTEIN pointed out that the unknown caller

undoubtedly familiar with the northeastern section.of

Memphis, through which he. claimed to be passing, but he

did observe that the unknown caller had reported that the

unknown caller turned "north on Jackson," whereas most

Memphians familiar with that section of

Memphis would

indicate that

they turned east on Jackson.

Jackson Avenue.:'

is generally regarded as an east-west street, although

at the point where Jackson Avenue approaches

the town of

Raleigh, Tennessee, the general direction is southwest to

northeast.

As to the possible identity of the unknown

caller, Mr. AUSTEIN furnished the following information

to Lieutenant HAMBY:

He stated that he does not know the identity

of the caller, but due to some events which have occurred

since that transmission, he wanted to furnish the following

information which might

possibly assist in identifying

• * the unknown: caller: ...

This information related to a white male whose

last name is FERGUSON. who is employed by the Ben j.

Malone Company as an apprentice steamfitter, and who

belongs to the same Union to which Mr. AUSTEIN belongs,

namely Steamfitters Local No. 614, 3754 Jackson Avenue,

near the Gragg School, the location of this Union being

near the town of Raleigh, Tennessee, through which the

unknown caller claimed to have passed after approaching

Raleigh, Tennessee, on Jackson Avenué.

M3.. AUSTRIN

furnished the following datornation to Loutonant naMay

concerning FERGUSON:

NW 55050 DocId: 32989748 Page 28

---

## Page 29

ME 44-1987

9

FERGUSON has a CB radio. His car is a 1966

blue Ford.

FERGUSON had reason to be in the general

area

covered by the transmissions mentioned above,

since FERGUSON and others were supposed to be at a

meeting at 3754 Jackson Avenue at Steamfitters Local

614 at 7:00 p.m.

Since. Mr. AUSTEIN knows that FERGUSON

has a CB antenna located on a: trunk mount, FERGUSON's

CB signals will be directional. That is, when FERGUSON

is transmitting, his signal will be stronger in one

direction than in another direction, the strongest

signal being to the front of the vehicle, the weakest

signals being to either side, and the signal to the

• rear. of the vehicle being of moderate strength.

Mr. AUSTEIN went on to state that if the

unknown caller were traveling east and then turned

north, the unknown caller's signals would have dropped

because of.

the directional properties of the trunk-mount

antenna. Mr. AUSTEIN noticed that when

caller reported that he was turning north off Summer

Avenue,

the signal dropped to the point where Mr. AUSTEIN.

had difficulty hearing the transmissions.

When Mr. AUSTEIN arrived at the Union Hall,

he was questioned by his instructor, Mr. EDWARD MORGAN,

as to why he was late.

Mx. AUSTEIN

explained to him

what had occurred in the presence of other persons at

the Union meeting.

Mr. FERGUSON, mentioned above, was

one of those present.

Mr. MORGAN indicated a displeasure

" over the fact that Mr. AUSTEIN had attempted to assist

the police in locating the murderer of Dr. KING. FERGUSON

at this time made the statement,

"Were you the one that i

heard in that mess on Channel 17?" Mr. AUSTEIN told

FERGUSON that he (AUSTEIN) was the operator attempting

to relay information to the police.

FERGUSON made a

remark to the effect that if AUSTEIN had "any sense at

all," he should have helped the white Mustang to escape.

FERGUSON went on to make other remarks indicating that.

AUSTEIN should not have assisted the police to catch a

man. who had performed a public service (FERGUSON indicating

by his remarks. that he thought that the person who killed

DI. KING had done a public service)..

AUSTEIN did not see FERGUSON again for some

45 minutes, when the entire group was dismissed early

because of

the

curfew which had been imposed.

As those

present left the meeting. AUSTEIN told FERGUSON to call.

him on the CB radio when both were in their cars,

because AUSTEIN wanted

to see how his unit sounded.

He added that this is a common practice among CB operators.

Shortly thereafter FERGUSON did call AUSTEIN, and when

FERGUSON started to talking on the CB. radio, AUSTEIN

associated FERGUSON's voice with the voice he had heard

earlier from the unknown person who made the hoax

transmissions as outlined above.

During this Interview, Mr. AUsTEly Identitled

one of the other CB operators who attempted to assist

the unknown caller and Mr. AUSTEIN as Mr. ED CHAUNCEY,

Mr. CHAUNCEY having contacted the Police Department by

telephone at the time the transmissions were being made

by the unknown. CB operator. He stated that Mr.. CHAUNCEY

also attempted to assist in getting the identity of the

unknown caller and the location of the vehicles as the

unknown caller was transmitting and claiming to be

chasing the Mustang.

Mr. AUSTEIN also advised during this interview

with Lieutenant HAMBY that he had previously assisted the

Police Department in September 1966 when he chased a.

suspicious person who was later apprehended by the Police

Department based upon the information which he relayed to

*the Police Department..

MONTEDONICO that inasmuch as it is believed his. son is 17

years of age, he was being contacted prior to contact of his

son.

Mr.. MONTEDONICO advised he is aware of thé CB radio

transmission since he recalls reading about this incident

in the local newspapers and

secondly his wife advised him

some

time ago that an officer of the Memphis Police Department

contacted her and their son about the incident.

Mr. MONTEDONICO

advised that at that time after the officer had talked to his

son, he discussed this incident with his son. He said he

learned from his son that his son did not make the broadcast.

Mr. •MONTEDONICO said

he believes his son and added he has never

known his son to lie to him in the past and sees no reason for

his son to lie to him about this incident since punishment for

a transmission of this nature would be minor.

Mr. MONTEDONICO advised he will contact his son and

determine when his son is available for interview because

since his son's graduation from high school in June of this

year he began to work in a local grocery store. Mr. MONTEDONICO

said he has no objection to'his son being interviewed concerning

this matter.

Mr. MONTEDONICO advised on July 16, 1968, that his

son had appointments on that date and it would be inconvenient

for him to discuss this matter on that date.

was free

during the morning and suggested that his son be

contacted for a specific time for an interview.

Mr. MONTEDONICO after swallowing hard and with a

break in his voice. said he did not make the CB radio trans-

mission in question and after wiping a tear that had welled up

In his eye added he does not know or have any idea who made.

that transmission.

He said he could not understand why anyone

would accuse him of this act.

He said that whoever accused him

of this does not know what they are talking about.

Mr. MONTEDONICO. said that he did not think there

were many CB operators in Memphis who had knowledge of these

units that would be knowledgeable enough to pinpoint anyone

making a CB transmission of this type.

He went on to add that

anyone with knowledge of CB radios could

disguise their voices

and cause distortions in the transmission so as to be unable

to be identified. He said anyone with any knowledge of CB

radios and transmissions of this type knows no one can positively

identify the source of the transmission unless the guilty

person admitted it.

I wanted to keep in contact with tha mobile unit number 4. I called any station on the

wis, ciai could cali the police department, and tell them that they (number 4 and the whita

mitatong) wan heading east on Summer Avanue. Now thie station right her answered, evidently

sured cut to ba chia fellow right here, number 2 station.

He case back to me and ha

etated that he was on the telophone calling the police.

I asked this fellow in number l

h1g: location again, and at the same particalar

I called out if there were any nobila

unita on Surner, or any other place near by that could pull over a police car, at almost

cha very instant, after I completed my broadcase, unit number

one came back and said he

hãd' à police car in sight, but ba did not tell ma the location.

I thought he was near Alaro

Plaza, but apparently he wasn't, I later found out that he was at Hollywood and Jackson."

To further quote Mr. Satchfield, he stated " at that particular time,. I looked at the meter

say radio

and It was reading 8.6, which indicated to me that it was a heck of a stron?

It was strong, clear, like you had a D104 mike with a pre-amp. (note; a Dao4 mile

Is a brand naze for a desk mike used to broadcast with, and is considered the best, pre-amo

Is & supplement added. to the aadio, to increase the power output or modulation) The number

& unit would not say anything, unless he was asked a specific question, and then he would

When this -number 4 unit got to Summer and Highland, I told Andy Andexsoin

that something's grong here, because the signal strengh on the number 4 unit was sonstant

clear, no noise what so ever.

If this had been a mobile unit, and was going east on Summer

Avenue, his signal strength would become less, and there would ba noise from the mobile unit.

I continued to call thia number 4 unit to gut his different locations and from the locationa

that he was glving be, and the time alement that it took him to go from one point to anothar

poini; just could not ba, he was noving too fast."

I niked Mi. Satcafield to describe what the voice of number four sounded like, and he stated

exceptionally high-Q child, that had been hearing the

#nodarick Crawfórd TV progIam and several other patrol type programs and was just brillani

anough at that age, to concock something of this nature, not with a formular,

the frequency of his

voice, vas quite on the ghih side, Ille a child from the age of 15 to 18 years old, with hia

soice just on the verge of changing. The studlo, or room, in which he was operating from

was just as dead silent, as 1f he was completely sealed off from everything else.

There wasnt

any rusic, no sound of other people in the room, no sound of a police monitar, just as clear

le was. asked that If a man had a halicraft receivar with no transmittez, and the party listanig

nobile chasing the white mustang, was so closa to the halicraft receivar, that it was over

loading the halicraft radio, causing too much pover in-put, which would distort the halicraft

rocaiver.

Iftar talking with Mr. Satchfleld, I contacted Mt. Green at Armour Radio Station, and after

Jiscussing this matter with him and bringing him up to date in what I had found out in

an offer to kill Dr. Martin Luther Ring. The clipping came

in the regular FBI mail and Duncan stated he did not know who

sent it to him.

A lew days later, while on the phone to ex-FBI Supervisor

Robert E. Peters in Louisville regarding a social engagement,

Duncan asked him about the clipping and who Clifton Baird was

and what the clipping reforred to.

peters said Baird was a

tall, heavy-get man who was in the vice Squad for a while and

that duncan should have known him from seeing him in the Vice

Squad while Duncan worked with the Detective Bureau in Louis

ville.

Approximately April 25, 1977, FBI Headquarters sent a

aommunication to Louisville and St.' Louis FBI Offices request-

the present locations of former Special Agent in Charge of

Louisville,

Bernard C. Brown; Supervisor Robert E. Peters;

and SA William R. Duncan as they were named by former Police

Officer Clifton

Baird alleging improprieties in the Martin

Luther King assassination case.

SA Duncan initially had no recollection of the incident

and he called former SA Peters at Louisville and asked him if.

he knew anything about this.

Peters replied that he had no

idea:

retired Police Captain John Hampton

of Louisville, a close personal friend, to detormine if he

Jinew anything

Hampton advised he did not know

but would

ask and find out what he could and call duncan.

was supposed to have taken place in the First District Offices

sometime in 1964 or 1965. Duncan called Lieutenant Vernon

Austin, whon he had known for 25 years, and asked hin about the

matter.

Austin related to Duncan who the Committee had asked

about and generally who was supposed to be present when the

alleged offer took place.

Duncan told the investigators that he had no recollection

concerning this matter and that he had in fact not slept and

walked the floor a number of nights for approzimately ten days

to two weeks. At this time he recalled one night thai Sergeant

say that he had heard that there was a

$250,000 or $500, 000 reward for the death of Dr. Martin Iuther

and was to add to or verify something that had already

to and to or verify

been said.. Duncan recalled going down to the area and making

the general statement that he had heard that there was a

$250,000 ox $500,000 price on DI. Martin Luther Ring from

either the Ku Klux Klan or the Communist Party Duncan added

15 verification was wanted, one should contact Bob Peters or

B. C. Brown of the FBI.

Duncan did not recall who was there

except several

uniformed officers who were coming and going and that there

were several in the area.

There were a number of questions

regarding whether 1t was a big roll-call area or the Captain's,

Sergeant's, Lieutenant's offices or a hallway. Duncan was

asked whether or not there were three or a dozen people present

and Duncan replied that there could have been between three

and twelve people, exact number unrecalled.

Duncan was asked whether Bob Peters was there. Duncan

said he did not recall his being there, otherwise he would

not have made the statement that "if you want to verify the

price on Dr. Martin Luther King contact Bob Peters or B. C.

Brown."

Duncan identified one person he thought was there as

Arlie Blaire (because Duncan had heard that he was supposed to

have been there from the questions asked) • Duncan recalled a

• younger, red-haired officer with a crew-cut or brush-cut.

Duncan said he had talked to Blaire and possibly his partner

in connection with a fugitive murder case that Duncan was

working.

Duncan was asked about his relationship with Robert Peters

and also with Fry, Hardin, Gregory, Bibb, Austin, Herman

Mitchell, John Mitchell and-B. C. Brown of the FBI.

The Conmittee Investigators apparently could not under-

stand why Duncan could not remember who was at the meeting.

They asked Duncan about an attempted bombing of Sergeant Brent

Hardin's car and if Duncan worked on the case. Duncan recalled

a bomb being placed on Hardin's car but that it apparently did

not go off. Duncan recalled it was possibly in connection with

an election regarding sone of the police organizations.

Duncan did not recall whether the FBI worked on the case

at all other than to offer the FBI Laboratory facilities;

however, Duncan did not work on the bonbing of the car.

Duncan was asked about the Louisville Chapter of the

Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and if it was a racist or

white-hate group. Duncan replied he did not know, but he

did receive a plaque and an honorary life-time membership

in the Louisville Chapter of the FOP for cooperation with

the Louisville Police Department when he transferred from

Louisville in 1967 and that this plaque was signed by Lieu-

2007 and shat

tenant Ico Joseph, then secretary and also secretary to the

Chief of Detectives.

Duncan was asked if the Ku Klux Klan was active in

Iouisville and if any FBI Agents or Louisville Police Officors

belonged. Duncan replied that he had little knowlodge of the

Ku Klux Klan at that time.

He heard in later years after he

loft Louisville that it did become active in Kentucky.

At this point the Investigators requested Duncan to wait

a while.

Subsequently they came. back and took Duncan to

another room and introduced Duncan to Mir. Edward M. Evans,

Chief Investigator for the Committee, and Mr. Robert J. Lehner,

Deputy Chief Counsel for the Committee. They then asked sone

of the same questions, including who was at the alleged meeting.

MI. Lehner said that the Louisville Police Officers were

"stonewalling" the issue and maybe when they were put under

oäth they woull recati some of the incident. There vere some

questions asked of Duncan such as did Duncan know black officer

Virgil White and a John Mitchell. Duncan recalled that he was

acquainted with Virgil White, who was a Vice Sguad Detective,

but did not recall John Mitchell, but did recall Detective

Herman Mitchell.

Duncan was asked if he knew Dr. King and it. Hoover's

relationship and Duncan said no, except what he had heard in

the newspaper and other modia sources:

Duncan was asked if he knew DI. Martin Luther King and

Duncan replied that he never récalled seeing him in person.

Duncan was asked if he knew King's brother, the Reverend A. D.

Williams King who lived in Louisville. He was told that Duncan

Kennedy came to Louisville to speak to a group on the 100ch

Anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation:

Duncan met Rev. A. D. Williams King with the Special Agent in

Charge at his church as he met everyone

else who was to appear

on the platform with Attorney General Kennedy as Duncan wanted

to be personally acquainted with everyone on the platform.

Duncan was asked if he knew Aaron Duke, Arlie Blaire's

partner, and Duncan replied that he did not recall him.

Duncan was asked if he had been the subject of any dis-

ciplinary action as a result of this matter and he replied

that he had not.

Duncan was asked if he had brought this incident to the

attention of any of his supervisors and, if so, when. Duncan

replied chat it was brought to the attention of SA Danny a.

coulson, EBIll, when he knew that he was to be called to the

Committee tor Interview.

Duncan was asked if he ever surveilled pi. King and if

he knew of any telephone taps regarding

DI. King. Duncan

replied that he did not surveil him and he had no personal

knowledge of any telephone taps.

Duncan was asked if he thought the matter was a joke

and if he could see anything funny in it and Duncan replied

that at the

time it was meant as a joke, but at the present

time it was a most serious and stupid thing, particularly in

light of events subsequent to 1965.

Duncan stated he would

take a polygraph examination to verify that what he was saying

was true.

Duncan was asked if he knew that DI. King was a frequent

visitor in Louisville during the racially troubled period.

Ile advised that he recalled the racially troubled times really

climaxed after 126%. Duncan was asked if he would know Arlie

Blaire's voice and Duncan replied he did not think he would.

Duncan was then told that he was to appear before the

Sub-Committee to give sworn testimony on November 30, 1977,

and would a subpoena be necessary. Duncan advised a subpoena

would not be necessary.

Duncan was given the phone number

of the Committee and told to contact hr. Everhart should he

recall anything else.

mentioned this at the time he told of the Kuklux Klan and/or

the Communist Party rumor in the First District Police area.

Duncan told them that he did not tell someone of his

recollection as a joke earlier because when the communication

was received fron the BureTu, it was pointed out that he would

be contacted regarding the matter by the Committee Investiga-

tors and that hé would at that time be briefed by legal personnel

fION FBIHQ.

Duncan was asked if he had discussed this mattertith

anyone outside the Bureau and his family. Duncan told them

he had talked one time with Lieutenant Vernon Austin by phone

and he did not discuss the joke other than ask if it could

have been a joke.

Duncan told them he had discussed it with

Robert Peters at least on three occasions. Once when it came

to his attention from a newspaper clipping, once when he ie-

ceived a communication fron FBI Headquarters, and one time after

he realized that it was a joke, at wich time he told Peters

that he (Peters) and B. C. Brown had nothing to do with it.

Duncan was asked about their get-together fot the football

game on November 11-12, 1977.

Duncan told them that Duncan

ani Peters seriously considered not getting together for this

year's football game but decided since they had known each

othor for 25 years and had plans to attend this football game

for over a year, that they would go ahead and get together.

They agreed not

; to discuss the matter, however.

Duncan also told them that when he realized that it was

a joke and that he was involved, he contacted a long-time

personal friend and lawyer to assist in the analysis and action

regarding the entire matter.

professionally and that he had been discharged for being an

alcoholic, that he had cured himself without going to Alco

holics Anonymous and he was there at the request of the

committee.

He was asked by Duncan if he ever recalled working

on the Nashan Lane murder case.

He did recall this.

a description meeting the one Duncan had recalled. He also

advised

airport mecting to the attention of Mr. Michael Everhart and

Mr. Edward Ivans of the Committee staff.

full time were Mr. Louis Stokes; Mr. Walter E. Fauntroy;

Mr. Robert W. Edgar; Mr. Samuel I. Devine; Mrs. Yvonhe

Brathwaite Burke; and possibly Harold E. Ford.

Mr. Michael Everhart of the Committee staff questioned

Duncan.

At this time Duncan asked Mr. Fauntroy if he would be

out of order if he asked when this incident was supposed to

have taken place and who was present. Mr. Fauntroy advised.

that he would be out of order.

Duncan was asked how long he had been in Iouisville,

Kentucky, and if he know P. M. IIy, Robert Gregory, Jamas Bibb,

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I think it appropriate at this time thatI

express my thanks to you and to those on your staff

who have greatly facilitated the course of the select

Committee's investigation.

Mr. Robert Keuch in particular

has been an outstanding liaison with the Select Committee.

His efforts in negotiating our Memorandum of Understanding

with the Department of Justice

and in expediting our

requests for immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002 and

6005 are greatly appreciated. During the time period

when

he was in

the hospital, he took great care to insure

that the Committee's business was in no way interrupted.

The cooperation we are receiving from Mr.

Keuch, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and other persons and departments within the Department

of Justice, is significantly assisting the Select Committee

in the fulfillment of its legislative mandate. The Select

Committee and its staff recognizes the efforts that have …

been expended, and wish to thank you for them. We look

forward to your continuing cooperation for the duration of

our investigation.

November 18, 1977

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Supervisory Fingerprint Specialist George J. Bonebrake,

FBI Latent Fingerprint Section, was requested to appear for interview

by staff members of captioned Committee relative to work performed

by him following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

on April 4, 1968. Mr. Bonebrake was interviewed on November 14,

1977, by four staff members, Melvin Kreidman, Attorney; Jeremy

Akers, Attorney; Ralph C. Locke; Research Analyst; and Susan Grimes,

Research Analyst.

Mr. Bonebrake was asked to describe latent fingerprint work

performed leading up to the identification of James Earl Ray. Staff

members were advised relative to the examination of evidence located

outside the rooming house from which the shot was fired, the developing

of six latent fingerprints on this evidence, including one on the rifle

and one on the binoculars, the subsequent developing of latent fingerprints

on a mạp of Mexico from a rooming house in Atlanta, Georgia, and the

determination that a latent fingerprint on the map, the rifle and the

binoculars were all the left thumb prints of the same individual. These

left thumb prints were compared with fingerprints of Bureau fugitives

and identified as left thumb prints of James Earl Ray. Additional

latent fingerprints were also identified as fingerprints of James Earl Ray.

Questions were received from staff members relative to the

development of latent prints, how they are maintained for record pur-

poses, disposition of evidence and other general questions. Questions

were also asked relative to the format of the list of fugitives used in the

Assoc. Dir comparisons resulting in the identification of Ray and why his record

Dep. ADAd. was listed in the first one hundred. Explanations and answers were

On November 15, 1977, Special Agent (SA) Thomas

• Colarelli was interviewed by 'HSCA Staff Attorneys Mar

peiser and Peter Beeson specifically regarding interview

conducted by SAs Colarelli

and Patrick Collins in New Orleans

in April, 1968, in connection with the Martin Luther King

assassination, and in general, about organized crime matters

in Louisiana.

The interviewsin question were of Vincent, Anthony

and Emma Liberto, 2211 Almonaster, New Orleans, In April.

1968, concerning

• Frank Liberto in

the produce business ir

Memphis, Tennessee, Emma's son, and the brother of Vincent

and Anthony regarding some disparaging remark Frank allegedly

made about King.

Agent could not recall these interviews even after

being presented

with copies of same to read.

Speiser and Beeson wanted to know of any known

organized crime ties the Libertos had with Carlos Marcello's

family in New Orleans, none of which is known by the Agent

to the best of his recollection. Agent observed, however,

that Carlos Marcello was a paid salesman for Pelican Tomato

grouds, which was also unknown to the Agent.

They further inquired as to whether or not there

were any Negro Agents assigned in New Orleans at the time

and what the general racial attitude was of the Agents in

the office at the time. As far as Agent knows, there were

no Negro Agents in New

Orleans at the time and the Agent

never to the best of his recollection heard any Agent voice

anything which would indicate a racial prejudice.

Staff Attorneys asked Agent if he recognized

numerous names as being related to organized crime in

Louisiana, most of which were unknown to Agent, except

prominent

gambling figures like Sam Dipiazza, who was

convicted by the New Orleans Division during

• that time

period.

Agent was asked specifically for a chart of the

Marcello LCN family and whether

Marcello had ties in

Louisiana. Agent referred

shreveport and Baton lou Either in New Orleans or Washington,

them to the Bureau

D. C. regarding LCN membership as Agent could not recall

with any specificity or accuracy the identity of any LCN

member except Carlos Marcello.

The names of Ernest Palmisano in Shreveport and

Frank Buic of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were mentioned by

Agent from recollection as individuals known to have or

alleged to have association with Marcello in the past in

these areas.

Agent was asked if he knew Arron Cohn, Charles

Stien (phonetic) or first name unknown Pecot, a New Orleans

Police Officer.

Agent acknowledged knowing only cohn to

the best of his recollection as the then Director of the

Metropolitan Crime Commission.

Several questions

were asked

concerning Cohn's background,

reliability, creaibility, and

trustworthiness which Agent responded to by limiting it to

his own contacts with Cohn as a source of information during

that time period.

Staff Attorneys wanted to know if Agent knew State

Policeman Raoul Escabell (phonetic) who was then a member of

the First Intelligence Unit of the Louisiana State Police

and also generally the degree of cooperation between the New

Orleans Office and the various local Intelligence Units in

that area.

Agent acknowledged knowing Escabell and could not

comment other than to say that his dealings with him and

others in Intelligence Units amongst the local authorities was

excellent at the time.

The thrust of the interrogatives implied that

organized crime figures in Louisiana would have a ulterion

notive in suppressing the blacks; and therefore, would have

reason to want King killed so as to eliminate his influence

on them.

Agent observed that he knew of no conflict in

interest between the Italian criminal element and the blacks

in Louisiana similar to those evident in the Northeastern
