: c. Ramparts' Tours - New York Media Workshop's

25 June 1972 with[_|7 and instructed her to attempt to determine -
the interest in,“and likely composition of, the New York : :
group and explore the possibility of joining such a group i
and explore the possibility of joining such a group.0{_17's

first reaction tothe tour was that the cost ($699, which

price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was too high.

It was explained to her that the cost factor should not

deter her from following through. It was then that( 17

voiced some concern that the timing of the tour mayZinterfere
with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of
mid-May or June 1972 up to this point). It was made clear

to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for :
her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well
prove to be.of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV
delegation and continuing the staging process prior to her
actual departure [17 said that she understood and would

look into the matter. She did not believe she would have

any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself
included on the tour. :
