a: United States - China Friendship Association

of the China Bookstore finally broke down under 77's

campaign and put her in touch with a local USCFA study

oroup under the leadership of Masa Susan Nazren aka Frank.

J7 has attended one session and, based on her initial

observation, provided the assessment.of MrS. Warren attached

hereto at the undersigned's request.""

7 believes she has

hit it off with Mrs. Warren because of her understanding

of dialectics (thanks to Andy Ness's tutoring) and, consequently,

she was instructed to attempt to develop a social-business

relationship with hero With respect to the other members

of the study group, claims that the situation,

to date,

has not been conducive to ferreting out the identities of

these individuals, but that she hopes that as the group

continues to meet,

some rapport will be established with her

classnates.

b. New School and language instruction:

7

Ramparts' Tours - New York Media Workshop's

Womens! Tour:

Acting on a suggestion proposed by Mr. Jason

the undersigned raised the subject of the Women's

Tour which is scheduled to visat london, Paris (where they

will meet the DRV peace delegation) and Rome from 27 May

25 June 1972 with

7 and instructed her to attempt to determine.

the interest in,

and likely composition of, the New York

group and explore the possibility of joining such a group

and explore the possibility of joining such a group.o%'s

first reaction tothe tour was that the cost ($699, which

price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was

too high.

It was explained to her that the cost factor should not

deter her from following through. It was then that?

voiced some concern that the timing of the tour mayzinterfere

with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of

mid-May or June 1972 up to this point).

It was made clear

to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for

her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well

prove to be.of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV

delegation and continuing the staging process prior to her

actual departure.

7 said that she understood and would

look into the matter.

She did not believe she would have

any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself

included on the tour.
