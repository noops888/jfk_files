Summary of Contacts with

AM HIP/1 and AMLASH/7

according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's

abystmal understanding of English), Fallucch established contact. with

AMWHIP without further difficulty. The meeting took place in the

restaurant of his hotel, the Vaakuna, and later in his room. We had

not at this time located AMASH, so the time was spent briefing AMNHIP

on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH when they wet. Tre

meeting lasted about one and a half hours.

Later the same day we called AMWHIP at his hotel to report

no progress in locating AMASH. Feeling it advisable to keep AMWHIP

occupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the

suburbs of Helsinki

The evening lasted until 1200, terminating with a

arink at the root bar of the vaakuna. suring the six hours, we had an

opportunity to explain carefully to AMWHIP that in order for us to help

his friend, AMLASH must be willing to follow our directions and agree to

certein conditions (elready greed apon hy interested Ige, parties).

We closed the meeting by telling him that we

would have an effort made in the morning to locate AMLASH, and that he

night as well relax, sight-see if he wished, and that we would be in touch

that the latter tried his best, but had not been able to do us any good,

also reported that its contacts had been mable to aid us.

We reported to AMRIP the fact that we had not located AMASH, and suggested

that we heve dinner together, to which he agreed. We met AMHIP. at 2100

at our hotel, the Kamp, and proceeded to the Royal Restaurant for dinner..

+ AWHIP was obviously getting on pins and needles because we had not found

his friend. He suggested that we call up the Cuban Festival delegation,

or try some hotels that evening. We persuaded him that it was not the

best idea jet; and to give other people more time to locate him. He

agreed, but kept coning up with ideas all evening for ways to locate AMLASH.

• He suggested that AMLASH liked night clubs, and that after dinner we could

perhaps try several. We agreed, more to placate hin that with any thoughts

of success.

We tried several, the Bruinsparken and the Theater Crill,

both of which were filled with drinking but no signs of AMASH. The

engaging in their national pastime, obviously irritated AWHIP, and

efter being puched around in the Incater Grill fo= an hour, ho said that

he thought this was a waste of time. We agreed, grabbed a taxi and went

home. During the evening, we told AWHIP that tomorrow morning, if nothing

had turned up, we would start by calling the better hotels in town ourselves,

and try this father laborious method to locate AMASH. We agreed to meet

AWHIP talked to AMASH for at least seven hours, from about

1000 in the morning until approximately 1700 the same evening. When AMHTP

called us at 1730, he presented us with the fact that he had convincedy

AMASH to talk with us, and for this purpose, he had an anted axinne

meeting that sane evening for approximately 1930. We would have preferred

to talk longer with AWHIP about. AMLASH's reactions, but time did not

permit. We arranged a dinner for 2100 at "The White lady", a restaurant

some way from the center of town, and succeeded in obtaining a private

dining room, a practice not uncommon in this

recommended restaurant,

as it Is often used by businessmen to have private dinners and afterwards,

business discussions;

We arrived at the White Lady first, arranged for the dinner, and

awaited AMWHIP and AMLASH, who arrived at 2110 by taxi. Although AMWHIP

had suggested to us that the discussions should be merely devoted to

getting acquainted the first evening, AMLASH commenced almost immediately

into a discussion of his feelings and, his position concerning Cuba today.

As reported

609) AMLASH was quite intense, and showed

the strain of his unexpected meeting with AMWHIP. Although obviously

under emotional strain, AMLASH presented his feelings in a relatively calm

mater, and was gives in docussing them throughout the seal. He caid he

was considering not going back to Cuba, but after talking to AMWHIP, he

felt that if he could do something really significant for the creation of

a new Cuba, he was interested in returning to carry on the fight there.

He said he was not interestea in risking his life for auy shatt undertakings

but that if he could be given a really large part to play, he would use:

himself and several others in Cuba whom he could rely upon.

These he said

know; are at a critical stage today. He also wanted to plan the execution

Of Carlos Rodriguez and the Soviet Ambassador, and also to ejiminate fidel,

by execution if necessary. He feels that if Fidel is eliminated, it would

be much easier to effect a take-over. (We listened for the most part, but

at this point tried to emplain to AMASH that men like Rodriguez could easily

be replaced by Moscow, and that the killing of the Soviet Ambassador, would

have only the briefest effect on the Soviet contral of Cuba., AMLASH was

not too interested in listening at this point, and continued by saying that

if he could achieve all these actions, plus others, in ore master stroke,

a take-over, during the ensuing confusion, would be much facilitated.. He

did not feel that Raul or the would be able to rally the people in sufficient

time to prevent

opposition forces from forming. His arguments and pians had

many flaws, but AMWHIP. could not help admiring (to hinself) AMLASH!'s

professed desire for vigorous and, hepefully, effective actions, designed

to alter the situation in no uncertain terms. While we were making no

committments or plans, we pointed out to AMASH that schemes like he envisioned

certainly had their place, but that a lot of coordinations planning, information-

collection, etc., were necessary prerequisites to ensure the value and success

of such plans. AMASH said he agreed with this, but we weren't too sure just

how mee this argument ATASH was willing, or amla be willing to buy.

Insist on a new deal for them. AMLASH said that although he had not been

ersective In helping the formation of a beneficial new Government in Cuba,

tie was now prepared to work towards that end. This time, he said, he

wanted. to look more towards the future, both for his own interests and for

Cuba's. The last time, he said that he thought only as far as the elimination

of Batista, and had not given consideration to planning for a government he

favorey after the fighting was over. We felt that AMASH meant that he was:

as much concerned about his (AMASH's) position In the government and

personal stake in a new Cuba, as he was about arything else.: It is our

Impression that AMLASH feels that he did not get his share of the spoils

or power from the Castro regime, in proportion to his contribution against

Batista. AMIASH Is a complicated personality.

It is' difficult to fairly

Judge, at this time, AMASH's degree of concern for a truly revolutionized

Cuba for the people's benefit, vs his concern to see a new government in

cuba in which he gets just recognition. This does not necessarily mean

that AMASH wants high political office, but he does want credit for his

efforts and the resultant power and prestige among his countrymen.

In addition to his concern for the manner in wnich the sovíets are:

using Cuba for their own designs in latio America, AMASH, i8 worried about

the extent to which Castro is using. the Soviet technique of capturing the

minds of the young people and the mass propaganda efforts against the masses.

I was apparent fron the discussions that AMASH would prefer ta be able to

luce Cuba without any outside support (and by inference, obligations), but

lic is a realist enough to concede that any efforts to overthrow Castre

pat have the support of PRIME. He is, therefore, willing to enter into

i scussions with a representative (s) of PBPRIME. towards this end.

AMLASH agreed to meet In Paris for the purpose of further debriefings

will to give any information in any field which he has. He is also most

111ling to discuss any plans which may lead to an overthrew of the present

wivernment. AMIASH stated many times, however, during the course of the

scietilnes, that he was only interested in involving himself in a plan-of

wignificant action, and maich was wuly isigued in achieve rapidly his desire

ta help Cuba. (fe told AMHIP later after we had left the meetings, that

la was afraid that: PBPRIME would continue to pursue its present course,

that of providing noney and ideas, but no ACTION!) AM.ASH was also most:

wlamant about not becoming involved in any way with the Cuban refugee

girclos and organizations in Miami. He said that he feels these are still

she sume people who left-Cuba, 1.e., willing to wait for the chance to return

and again puroue, their ony interest, that of making money. He also said.

he felt that the Cubans there were completely penetrated by Castro informants,

and that for them to know of his cooperation with PBPRIME; would be the same.:

as telling Castro, and thus his future would end against the Wall! We

wed hin that maxmn security would he practiced, as far as these people

were concerned. He also does not wish to trust or be Involved with, any

contract cubans, Only a Pains: does he wish to deal. (Along this line,

AMITP stated that he did not think it advisable to reveal any of these

negotiations to AMCONCKRT/], whom AMWHIP has known for many years and le

quite friendly, but whon he does not feel can keep a secret of this nature.)

This meeting terminated at 0030 on 2 August. The three participants.

took a taxi together back to town. AWHIP and AMASH stopped off at a local

night club, Teater Grillen, while we continued on to our hotel.

No ircidents:

of a security natwe were observed, and it was felt that the meeting was

held without the knowledge or observation of the opposition.

• 4. Meeting of 2 August 1962.

We met with AMHIP in his hotel room (No. 1l2 at the Vaakuna) at

1700 hours on 2 August. We discussed the events and talks of the preceding

evening for some time. At approximately 1800, AMLASH arrived, greeted

us affably, and joined us for a drink. AMLASH used this meeting to re-:

state his position concerning his desire for participation in a reaily

significant action against the Castro regime. Having decided by this time

that further discussions and debriefings of AMISH should take place with

a Spanish-speaking C/O, we outlined the idea to meet for such a purpose in

Parise. AMLASH did not like the idea of too many nemle boing punno af his

cooperation with PBPRIME, but agreed that it would be best in order to

allow himself to express his ideas and plans better; and to be able to provide

us with his information in the greatest possible detail.

that he felt that he had better perform this role to some extent, as it was

expected of him by fidel, and he did not wish to provide any unnecessary

chances for unsatisfactory reports to be sent back home concerning his lack

of cooperation with the cuban delegation. In making the arrangements for

& Paris meeting and further discussions, AMLASH said, in response to the

question, that It would be quite normal for him to be in Paris, äs he had

already cleared this with Fidel; with whom, he remarked caustically, ore

had to clear everything these days. He then expressed the idea that he

this meeting AMLASH felt he had to stay until the end of the Festival for

cover purposes. Since AMHIP had already accidentally run into several

people he lner, It was agreed that he should leave town for Stockholm in

the near future. We would remain behind until AMASH left, serving as an

energency contact in the event of change in ALASH's plang. It vas arranged:

6 Other louth Festival Targets•

This area covered by cables

158L and

1609: The best

and, actually, only possibility among the participants was Jose Venegas.

However, both AMLASH and AMHIP did not want to become involved with him

as they felt that this, in both their cases, might compromise their

Interests in AMASH's returning to. Cuba.

AMWHIP felt, for example, that

Veregas would almost certainly connect his presence here with an attenpt to

do sortething with AMLASH. AMLASH also felt that he did not want to disclose

any indications of his real sympathies to Tenegas, if he (AMASH) were going

to return to Cuba. Without doing this; it would be difficult to get any"

reactions or opinions from Venegas, thought AMLASH. Venegas, it is felt

by AMLASH, might very possibly be counted on at a later date if this was:

desirable. An approach could then be worked out at that time.

As reported, AMASH came to the Festival as a "special delegate,"

after his request to Fidel was approved. AMASH Claimed to Fidel that he

was fatigued and sick and needed a good rest in Europe. The Festival

provided the excuse, Fidel bit the bait, and AMLASH got to Europe to see

anil, his criginal intention. AMNIP felt that this is a logical and

honest explanation.. It is interesting to note that neither the local

service, u/2, or any of the Cuban delegates he asked, could determine the

whereabouts of AMASH. It is perhaps reasonable to assume that the Cubans

were told not to tell of his presence to anyone not from theirimmediate

delegation.

7. AM/HIP's Role in AMLASH Talks.

AWHIP has been most helpful and cooperative in establishing*

the initial contacts with AlIASH, and he undoubtedly does have mich

influence over AMLASH. AMLASH also trists AMWHIP explicitly, as evidenced

by his remark to us that WHiP was the only onesthom hostelt that

could fully trust and to whom he could speak openly. Of course, he did

speak openly at lengtin to us at the behest of AWHIP, but it is also

obrious that he does not tell us everything. AWilp has given good advice

in the handling of AMLASH, but, as he has a tendency to interpret AMLASH's

remarks and feelings subjectively, and to attempt to guide us a bit too

much, it might be wise to eliminate in later portions of the talks in Paris

With a Spanish speaking O/o, thie shuma noi be too difficult to do, and

without alienating AMWHIP. AMWHIP has no clandestine training to speak of,

as evidenced by his actions in this case. However, to his eredit; he

responds readily to directions in this area, and follows rather well suggestions

for adding to the security of the meetings. His remark about the s

adrisability of keeping his old friend ANCONCERI/1 out of the operation or

from any knowledge thereof, is gratifying. AMWHIP also has gently explained

to us, that while he is a Cuban at heart and loves the Cubans, they simply

cannot he trusted to keep secrets amons asy ce their fienus nho, for au.

real tested reasons, they consider safe and discreet. As a general

statement, we feel that AMWHIP is a good security risk operationally, and

that with more exposure to the game, will become a good and useful asset

under almost any circumstance. He is, however, somewhat subconsciously:

subjective about his evaluations of AMIASH. He is completely honest, and 1s

using a considerable amount of his own money, not to mention time, in this

peration. We only hope his farch in

a justifiea.

B. Evaluation of and Comments about ANYASH.

Our' initial comments forwarded in cable

1609 remain unchanged.

We have seen too little of, and cannot converse in the native language of.

MASH, to make any strongly valid assessment of him to datese Taither

sefond meeting with AMLASH, he was considerably more retaxeas than ins the

fifst, but just as intense about his convictions.. or seemingly so. ANTASH

stited that, having decided to return to Cuba, he would enrole in an

officers refresher type course at Matanzas in an effort to renew old

fry contacts, re-assert his position as a major in the Revolutionary Army,

and attempt, to reiestablich some recognition and following in Arty and ou

Gaterment circles.

For the sake of completeness, we repeat our comments regaraing

AMLASH from

to us that last year

don't know at this point.

AMIASH said he wanted to go back and fight. AMHIP was sure,

that he would defect, period. AMASH told AMWHIP that he could notrsee

the point of making a statement regarding defection and the state of affairs

in Cuba, and then accepting a dole in Miami. Nor could he see any use in"

propaganda efforts in Latin America or Europe, Later, after our talks

wth him, AMASH told AMWHIP a little different story, 1 ely that her

kuld not want to make a public defection statement, because of the

probable repercussions against his friends in Cuba for no good reason.

This area of thinking needs to be examined at length in Paris. A Spanish-

speaking C/a might well do the trick:

were held in our hotel room (the Carlton) and during the several dinners.

COPENHAGEN!

10. Travel to, and Stop In Copenhagen.

AMLASH and AMWHIP took SAS flight 407 to Copenhagen on the after-

noon of 10 August.

In speaking at length about meeting. in Paris, AMLASH

felt sure that there would be no problem in getting permission to visit

Paris after returning to Prague. He felt that he better not visit Paris

first, as it mighti cause some undue interest in Prague Cuban circles

as to why he was away so long. He also had some trouble in getting the Air-

line to approve his side trips to Stockholm and Copenhagen. They wanted

him to fly direct to Prague from Helsinki. He refused their requests,

and said that he would pay his own way to Stockholm and Copenhagen for

the difference) if need he.

This he finally had to do, for which Amirp

footed the bill. (perhaps we should later absorb). We felt that this

ability to pay for the extra routing might cause some suspicion among his

colleagues. AMLASH said "no", but we are

not so sure. Perhaps he can tell

to us as a friend, rather than as a PRPRIME representative. During

more agressive way to deal with the problen, but that such methods would.

Leave us open to the old familiar charges of interference in the internal

Obviously AMLASH was correct in much of his thinking, but rather thay stand

him, as a former student leader and politician, any ideas he might have

for combating the Commnists in the struggle for the minds of Latin

this problem and to offer what ideas and suggestions he could.

predicament with the active did uf formm. Amigh Secred zore Stacore

In dealing with AMASH, one trait of his which confronts the c/o:

at every tyun is his tempermental reactions over points which would

fererally be considered minor

For example, at one time when we were

Midiscussing the various aspects of AMLASH's future role inCuba, we usedy

the term "assassinate". The use of this term, we later learned from

P4 ASHIP and froT ALASH himself, was most objectionable to the latter, and

he was visibly upset. It was not the act he objected to, but rather merely

the choice of word used to describe it: "Fliminate" was acceptable, but

Lously the term "assassinate" had a distasteful connotation. From

a scussions with AWHIP, 'this lable of "assassin" had been given to

AMLASH after sone of his escapades against Batista supporters in the:

pre-Castro era. Another example, which AWHIP discussed with us, occurred

during a meeting in Mexico City in March 1961, when a KUBARKER said to

AMLASH; "I'm prepared to help you in any way tithin my power".: According

•to AMWHIP, AMLASH later turned to him, shrugging his shoulders in a manner

of saying, "So I need help from hin?" These examples are pointed out

here in order to indicato the degree us prive anu sensivivily one find's:

in AMLASH, and to note that however tedious this attitude may become to

the C/0, it is, from personal experience, quite necessary to adjust one's

-Following this meeting, we went to a small bistro near our hotel, phoned

AHIP, and arranged for a meeting in our hotel room at 1830:

This meeting took place in our hotel room (#ll) at the Hotel

Roblin,

at 1830. The purpose was merely

to meet AMWHIP and re-assure him

that arrangements for AMLASH's meeting were laid on. We also made

arrangements to give hin his expenses for the trip and account for same

during a meeting the following day. This will permit him to leave for

Milan without delay at the close of our business with AMLASH.: He was

getting "nervous", as he called it, and will be glad to get this business

over and done. We agreed. He wanted to remain until the conclusions of

the talks with AMLASH, however; for he felt that he could be of use in

handling AMLASH. We agreed. He did not, of course, want to be in on

any operational discussions, but just to be on hand to guide his

Lempernental: "chango".

He was very anxious to meet Wallace A. Growerya in order to

point out to him in advance some of the quirks in AMASH's personality.

In talking to us, AWHIP said that a person with the background of

Aruhon, must be hanity in a certait mauer, tand if done, he will beapord.

AWHIP told us that while he is of course subjective about AMASH, he also

realized that he is of a different background and make-up (flattery?)

than either we or himself, and that in order to get him to produce and

cooperate, the problem must be approached in a certain way. He said

AMWHIP continually stressed the point that to work with people

like AMLASH, 16 was necessary to have them first accept a person either

by personal contact over a period of time or on the recomendation of a

good friend. He felt that while it was necessary for us to spend sone time

becoming acquainted with AMASH, It also might be necessary for Growery

to go slow at first. This, we said to AMWHIP was all right; up to a point,

but that we felt quite enough time had been spent with AMLASH already,

and that the meetings in Paris were going: to get down to business quickly,

and proceed as necessary to conclude business as rapidly as possible.

We felt that AMHIP understood our point

During this talk, AMWHIP again expressed the feeling that if

Cuba-is not retuned to freedon vithin tro jears, he was roing to set

up business permanently in Paris or Southern California, and forget the

idea of returning. He was obvious moved by the finality of such a decision,

as he is à real cuban patrioi. Or so we believe:

ACHIP was reminded that he himself had stated that it would be best for

him (AMWHIP) to talk to Jaime first in order to explata AMASH's personality:

ANNHIP was unhappy that this meeting could not take place imediately,

but said he would explain the matter to AMLASH.. This meetings it is noted,

or local police. Since it was pointless to stop the meetings now and

the address of the safehouse had not been mentioned verbally, it was

decided to continue as planned. Paris will forward account of surveillance

and outcome as soon as possibie. (when ve left Paris, it was determined

that this "surveillance" of our meeting might have been a truly freak

coincidence, and the subject of the surveillance was another target, not

us. We don't think so. However the pending Paris report should resolve this.)

26. Miscellaneous Comments on Case, Personalities, and Actions in Paris:

AMLASH's attitude in Paris was essentially that which it had

been during the previous contacts, in Scandinavia, that is, changeable as

the weather, varying from occasional flashes of wit and mirth to degrees

of discouragement and perhaps despondency. He was generally receptive and

Interested in procedures and conversations during the meetings and during

periods of instruction. He makes little attempt to disguise his feelings,

should he becone tired, bored, or disinterested. His social graces are

not the sharpest honed. He can, however, be reasoned with, even in some

of his contrary noods. AMWHIP was particierly effective in taching nim

during these.. We are in complete agreement with AMWHIP when he describes

AMLASH as being full of complexes. But further than that, AMLASH not only

has cupiexes as such, but it is felt that he is generally preoccupied

with his thoughts, presumably about pachlems cuay, anu is outen seemingly

incapable of maintaining his interest in things about him for any length

of time. If one is discussing Cuba, however, he obviously is very

interested. Therefore, it night well be that he is actually so pre-

and treated accordingly. When, on occasion, he "opened up"a bit with us,

ass rather exasperating to deal with, but we feel

that this is a trait of his which is a normal fact of his personality,

and not assuned to try the metal of his case officers. We may be wrong,

but doubt it.

27. Physical Appearance:

AMLASH is about 5'1l", weighs about 175 lbs., dark wavy hair,

thinning poticably on top and usually needs combing; brown eyes, small,

almost petulant nouth, snall nose, pale complexion; eyes are a little

small for his face and very intense in expression. He prefers dressing

informally, and is prone to wearing jackets sith no tie.: (He could

mingle with the typical small town corner-loungers without difficulty.

When dressed up, he presents a good appearance in a masculine way, and

apparenty from Amwilt's stories, does quite well with the women. Concerning

the question of his being a homosexual, we cannot say whether he has a

hidden bent in this direction, but if he does, he is not at any rate, a

purist. but rather Ar-De.

28. Language •

Native Spanish, fair to good English, but with limited vocabulary.

He can be successfully conversed with using English, but it has to be

done slowly and with basic constructed sentences. It is not possible to

be articulate with him, if he is expected to grasp the full meaning of the

conversation.
