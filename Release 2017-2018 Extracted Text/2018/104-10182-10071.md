Military Profile

ITCHELL WERBELL is a short,
wiry man of 52, quick with a

quip and quite sensible until he begins
talking about communism or other so-

cla} issues, He has the face and bear
Ing of a Prussian officer, an nage he

cultivated by wearing a che ond
occasio: ly a morocle. He often
dresses in nillitary clothing of indeter-
minate origin, and he embellishes the
image by talking in slightly clipped
sentences peppered with military
Phraars, There ts nothing phony in
this, WerBell hes a strong altachment

to weapons and to warfare, and he has -

been around them s0 ‘long that the
Ideas anid styles théy foster are an in
grained part of bis personality.
He comes by both his militarism and
“anticommunism honestly. His
* father was: an officer in the Russian
Impqrial army, even thouch he was
born, in the United States. “It was a,
Iricky situation.” says Mitch, “He was
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russia.
In those days vou could do that.”

The elder’ Werficll fought against:

ne as head of the department, and
soon after that he went on his own,

In the mid-50s, WerBell pulled out
of his ageney and then formed his
wat public relations firm. “I'd already
been drifting into international PR"
WerBelt says, “using my family back-
ground, I had tremendous contacts in
Europe, and 1 moved into the Far
East, too." How much of this moving
in was milltary, WerBell won't say,
but his business teak on more and
mure vf what he calls a "gcopotliteal”
flavor,

Before long, he was dabbling In
{ Latin. American dictatorstuips. “Betore

Fidel took over in Cuba, we were

with a grin, “Gur functicn was to keep
Hatista In power, althouzh the US.
government was looking favorably on
Fidel at that point" .

Frou ali this, even Werfell doesn't
Know exactly how, came a passtonate
‘oneern about communism. “[ decided
to devote whatever time } could to
anticommunist activities,” he says
“At first It was sort of a hobby, but
then it became my main drive In life.
What I'm doing now"—here he ges:

“affords me a damned good living,
But the living ts not why Ido it."

The Heart of It

still a hobby, albeit a paying hobby,
WerRell purchased the Dobbs estate.
He installed rudimentary design facili.

ofthe enemy, and you'll win the fight,’
‘That's a lot of bull. The way to
get their hearts, if they're the enemy,
is to shoot ‘em and cut the hearts

While he experimented with weap.

ing low overhead on a test flight.

Tie trom this base of operations that,
ch WerBell has been med-
dlinw acin, this time in the affairs of the
abouttowetume suvercixa tute of the
Bahamas.

His activities — althoxgh no one is
completely sure.just what they entail —
have prompted Bahamas Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling to denounce WerBell
and attomey Edwin Marger, an associate,
on the floor ‘of the Bahamian Parlia-
ment. Pindling called them “internation-
al fortune hunters” with “designs on the
territorial sovereignty of the Bahamas.”

Werbell’s inivolvement in the Bahamas
—as an advisor to a faction that wants
the island of Abaco either to remain a
Crown Colony’ or to become a separate
nation when the rest of the Bahamas be-
comes fully independent on July 10 —
has ‘also prompted some concern by the
U.S. State Department's Caribbean
Affairs Desk.

It is not a completely unfamiliar expe-
rience to WerBell to have elements of the
United States government at least coa-
cerned — if not outright displeased —
with somie ot his free-lance foreign-policy
maneuvers, He selishes recalling how a
visitor flew down to Georgia once to give
him the message: “The functions of the
foreign pulicies-of the United States are
the business of the State Department in
Washington, not of Mitchell WerBelt. in
Powder” Springs. Ga." In another
incident, a. congressional subcommittee
questioned him about his role in an
aborted attempt to launch an invasion of
Haiti fmm South Florida.

The subcommittee, the investigations
arm of the House Committee on Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce, was con-

cerned with the role played in the inva-
sion preparations by CBS News. The net-
work was attempting to film a documen-
tary on the military coup’ being -planned
by an alliance of Haitian and Cuban ex-
iles. ‘The. Haitians wanted to tepple
Francois, (Papa Dec) Duvalier; the
Cubans wanted to establish an anti-Cas-
tro base in Haiti. CBS was steered into
the project by Andrew St: George,'a free-
lance journalist:adventurer. who also ‘ia-
troduced Producer Jay McMullen to Wer- -
Bell in the process.

"The network, aftcr spending: apwatds
of $170,000 on the proposed documentary,
Project Nassau, decided to scrap it, “As

‘The answers to “why” WerBeil got in-
volved are, in the language of the sub-
committee report, variance” with
each other:

Answer No. ti". {felt then and I

kill the boil and cancer of communism in
the Western Hemisphere deserves every
effort. This was my fundamental reason
for going into it. This was why I agreed to
assist them and why I did everything 1
could to assist them up to the point
where I felt the whole program was ridicu-
tous.”

Answer “1 wok this whole proj-
ect as a rather entertaining comedy. I'm

and { continued to do so. | felt that this
was @ very amateurish attempt at some-
thing which I didn’t know really what
was going on, and it was an interlude of
entertainment as far as I'm concerned.”

The role he. played is also unclear,
From the point that CBS entered the sit-
uation in May of 1966. WerBell appeared
at various times to be a nctwork consul-
tant, a CIA operative. a CIA operative
impostor, a leader of the invasion, a U.S.
government spy on the invasion, a gun-
Tanner and a wired-for-sound observer in
an attempt to shake down the Haitian
consul in Miami for $0.00 to call off
the invasion.

‘Suffice it to say that the entire episode
was typified by tne fact that the 68-foot
sloop Moor Richard, 9 beat WerBell had
leased for the expedition, was repossessed
while Werdell and others had it docked
at the Ocean Reef motel in Key Largo.
“The. hoat neyer had anything on it ex-

afcer WerBell hud gone home. Seven per-
fons were indicted for conspiring to vio-

WerBei ‘Charges - against WerBell,
however, were dropped on orders of

* then-Attorney General Ramscy Clark.

WerBell now ‘declines to discuss the

“mechanica of how the charges against

him were dropped, except to: say that he
was “in constant contact with the govern-
ment” during his participation in-the in-
vasion attempt and that he “did nothing
wrong.” In 1970, however, WerBell told

“The company” is génevally used as a
euphemism for the Central intelligence
‘Agency — an arm of government WerBell
says now he has never had anything to do
with, except to sell it some guns. The
company he was talking about, he says,
was CBS, Over the years, however, Wer-
Bell has spoken often. of his association
with the Company. Producer McMullen
quoted WerBell to the congressmen #3 say-
ing he had “previous experience” with “the
company.” "And when I asked him what
company he meant, he said the CLA," Me-
Mullen said.

“Everybody always gets that impression
about any goddam thing we do,” WerBell
says, It is @ conclusion that is neither
difficult nor illogical. It may not, however,
be accurate.

‘The Old Boy Network — "And don’t you
ever kid yourself that there isn’t such a
thing,” says WerBeil — is the cloak-and-
dagger types’ answer to the union hiring
hall, It is a locsely structured help want-
ed-situation wanted grapevine. “I became
friends with a bunch of guys who are now
four. and five-star generals,” recalls Wer-
Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind
Japanese fines in World War 0.

TMiermorabitia of the OSS days and sub-
sequent adventures hang in WerBell’s
home and in his psyche. The walls of both
his upstairs den and downstairs “war
room’ are decorated swith dozens of hunt-
ing (upstairs) and military (downstairs)
weapons, Six unsheathed swords are

locked, contain handguns rangi. from

While in London recently, as Parliament
prepared for the final vote endorsing Baha-

known to a reporter for the London Daily
Mirror (circulation five million) that he
was: 1) four-square for the cause of the
Council for a Free Abacd, and 2) récruiting
British mercenaries “for a project I have in
mind.” Abaco? “Who said it was Abaco?”
said WerBell. The fruit of the interview

= Such were the initial tactics in the Bat-

British press, seemed second in anticipated

WerBell as a comrade-in-press release was
Lt.-Col. Colin (Mad Mitch) Mitchell, a
right-wing House of Comnions member
and a hero of the Battle of Aden during his
days with the Argyle & Sutherland
Highlanders, Mitchell, who was muttering
tothe British press about-secret izissions to
Abaco and the such, recentiy visited Wer-
Bell in Powder Springs, WerBell said.

‘While there are some peaple who admire
Mamboyance auch as WerBell’s, there are
others who don’t. Among those others are
WerBell's former business associates, a
group of New York investment bankers
who bought WerBell and Bennett B.
Bintliff, an associate, out of the Military
Armament Corp. (MAC) that the pair had
founded. “He's been headline press all over
England, end we're just s quict little man-

Reeves Il, chairman of the board of MAC's
parent company, Quar.tum Corp. “He's a

see responsible executives who are discreet,
who will transact business — not tell war

Reeves, however, says he doesn’t dislike
WerBell — he just doesn't want to be
associated with him in the arms business,
“I like him a great deal. He's amusing and
he's a character. But letting him run Colt
or letting him run MAC is Like tuming

WerBell and his associates in Powder
Springs have now reincorporated under the

overly fond of Reeves and his peopte either.

The people who hire the firm, WerBell
says, “are interested in an organization
that’s capavle of doing the political,

geopolitical, clandestine and economic op-

erations that we're capable of. We operate

Just how much'demand there is for pre-

pability Defense Systeris International has
for providing them~— is unzertain, What
the firry would appear tc have an obvious
‘capacity for, however, is warfare. Its presi

son-in-law, Paul Routhier, a retired U

the staff are various oth

wars, or shoot people themselves. If they
did, they say, they could go to jail for vio-
lating US. neutrality laws. Nur does it sell
the guns to shoot people with, unless the
U.S, State Department approves, they say.
And the State Department isn't about to
approve the sale.of any arms by WerBell to
the Abaconian secessicnists, No matter,
says WerBell. “We have no intention of
arming Abaco in any shape or fashion.
Anyway, they have more arms down there
than we have here.

So why, then, is there a photograph

officer.and acquaintance.of WerHell’s who
was Introduced to Watkins, There is also
sume talk about approsching the Organiza-
tion of Americen States and the United
Nations. And about’ a referendum on
Abaco July § — the day. befure Bahamian
independence — on whether to unilaterally
declare Abaco a free naticn. ““We are put-
‘ting to bear all our act and friends to
‘tell the world; ‘Here's a country that
duesn’t want to go this way,” says Wer-

Bell.

“The accuracy of that assessment of feel-——
ing on Abaco can he questivned. Many of
the Abaconians who originally op)
separation from the Crown abandoned the
movement as fruitless in December, when
the, British goverment decreed that the
Baharaas — all of the Bahamas — would
becorne independent. Nor was there ever
complete opposition throughout Abaco to
the Pindling government and indepen-
dence: of the two Parliament members
elected’ by the isiand’s 6,300 residents, the
ne other than Watkins is a Pindling sup-
porter and a backer of independence. The

~s impetus. for. the: Free Abaco movement,
both Pindling and. Minister of External
Affairs Paul Adder'y have charged;-comes -
from ‘outside the Bahamas, “I still think
i

Of the people on Abaco know very little of
Werbell and Marger outside of whut they
read in the British press

., WerBell says his motivations ure strictly

 anti:cormunist. A far right-winger — he
described himself to a newsmun us “to the
right of Attila the Hun" — WerHell sees
the Bahamas ag islands ripe for commu-
nism, “Every goddam single symptom that ”
was present in Cuba exists in the Bahamas

today.” he says.

—Warpatrs ofinion of the Pindling gov
ernment and of the Bahamas’ politivai cli-
‘mate is one which many observers of the
Bahainas do not share. Although the over-
whelming majority of the islanders are
black and have become very assertive con-
cerning racial equality during the past de-
cade or s0, the Banamas have teen deeply
influenced by English tradition. The =
‘Anglican and Baptist Churches, both con-
servative institutions, are heavily rep!
sented. And ‘the U.S. govemment is

ardently courting Pindling as a friend.
But WerBell, son and heir of
colonel, seesthe rise of Bofshes

e the peaceful emergence of s new
democratic nation, And the -question is
whether or not to take him seriously as he
sits in Powder Springs with his bush jacket
and walrus moustache, talking of hiring
mercenaries and of naming a company
after what he thinks is the Greek letter
meaning war.

The Staté Department, meanwhil
keeping a close watch, “You can't
man off as aclown..” said one source, “if he
has a warehouse full of arms. We take him
seriously enough to want to know what he's
up to.” f

‘silitary. Armauent_Corporation.
Pgrazraph Three
17 May 1973,

Reference:

1. There are no Headquarter's traces on Dr. George A. Winkler,
but there are traces on, the Military Armament Corporation and its
Board Chairman, Nr. Mitchell Livingston WerBell IIE (201-259910),

In 1967 WerBell organized a firm called SIONICS, Incorporated
(Studies in Operational Negation of Insugency and Counter Subversion),
«Specializing in producing silencers. In 1970; WerBell Bdtged with
Quantum Ordnance Bankers and the new firm was named the Military
Armament Corporation’ with Nerdell- as Chairman of the Board.

.2. “WerBell- was born.on.8 March 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

He’ served in: the OSS’ and: was ‘of interest to BKIERALD in 1959 when it
was discovered.that.he was involved ‘with antd=Castro plotters in
the Dominican Republic. -Ile was granted a POA in August 1959 but this
was Cancelled in October 1959.-when his information proved to be of

little value ond it.was ‘suspected that’ he was using BKHERALD funds

to promote personal interests. He has subsequently attempted to

+ pass himself as LNBUZZ connected. and as a BKHERALD employee. Mr.
herBell's lengthy.201 file shows a long history of his appearing in
areas-and situations whére he can make a fast buck.. He is character-
ized as unscrupulous, a "wheeler dealer", and a promotor of grandiose
schemes. WOTACK advises that the arms WerBell offers for sale are
of good quality, but that the selling price is considered excessive.

3. In that Mr. WerBell is a WODUAL citizen, the above infor-
mation should not be.passed to CGPAT/1, However, the Station could
inform CGPAT/1 that ‘the Military Armament Corporation has an unsavory
Teputation and, although it may have permission from NVIDEA to export
-}-aTmsy -it~has” no” LNBUZZ connections and that any dealings with the
corporation should be approached with extreme caution.

” Dear Mr. Liebling:

Re: WerBell, Mitchell L., DI
In response to. your letter of 16 February 1971 concerning =
iz . Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, III's alleged affiliation with the Central
pees Intelligence Agency, we have investigated the matter thoroughly,
and based on aii the information available, the answer is "No" -
for each of your questions numbered 1 through 6.

You should be advised that Mr. WerBell voluntarily con-
tacted a represeniative of the Central Intelligence Agency's
Domestic Contact Service in Coral Gables, Florida; and at
Mr. WerSell's initiation furnished voluntary information for
the period 15 December 1965 - 19 November 1966 with eleven
contacts. It should be noted that the function of the Domestic
Contact Service is to receive information which individuals
feel is of interest to the United States Government. The office
is overtly listed in the telephone book under the Central Intel~
Ligence Agency and, thereforé, is readily available for contact,

If Mr. WerBell suggests an affiliation with the Central
Intelligence Agency, he is hereby authorized to divulge the
details of his alleged affiliation in the hearing go that he may
not use ostensible security as a means of avoicing answering

Sincerely,
‘Bp D

result, from execution of the 12 month NCTTT will, undoubtedly
disclose additional and more effective techniques of killing or
neutralizing ‘communist terrorists in Thailand and will contribute
immeasurably to bringing stability and RTG gontrol into its

border areas.

Mr. Baker stated that he:has been in contact with a Mr. wareupLy~“20/- 75% Wo
~ WERBELL, III of Powder. Springs, Ceorgia. 7

fete eee “Mrs Baker says that Mr. Werbell Js inthe business of manufacturing .
weapons and delivering them-ty air throughout the world. Mr. Baker
understands that Mr. Werbell does this for the Central Intelligence
Agency.

Mr. Boker seys thit-Mr. Werbell is a supposedly reputable man,
Baker understands, from Werbell, that Baker will have to get a
CIA security ‘clearance to fly for Werbell.

Mr. Bakcr has served in the military. He has had some paramilitary,
training. He belongs in a "jump club" and now participates in
“freefall", etc. He has a Morse Code proficiency and a Radio
License Second Class. He has Spanish language proficiency and would
be willing to collect for us.

This man persists on pursuing me re this CIA/Werbell relationship.
I tell him I don't know a thing about it. It seems he has a smuggling
record when he was 17 and he's afraid this may keep him ifrom getting
this Werbell "CIA" clearance, {
