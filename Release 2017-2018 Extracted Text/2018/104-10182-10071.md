about lo-become suvereign rente uf the

Bahamas.

His activities - although no one is

completely sure just what they entail -

have prompted Bahamas Prime Minister

Lynden Pindling to denounce WerBell

and attorney Edwin Marger, an associate,

on the foor of the Bahamian

Parlia-

ment. Pindling called them "internation-

al fortune hunters"

with "designs on the

territorial sovereignty of the Bahamas."

Werbell's involvement in the Bahamas

-as an advisor to a faction that wants

the island of Abaco either to remain a

Crown Colony or to become a separate

nation when the rest of the Bahamas be-

cornes fully independent on July 10 -

has also prompter some concern by the

The answers to "why" WerBell got in-

committee report, "at variance"

ench other:

Answer No. 1:"

Answer No. 2: "I took this whole proj-

ect as a rather entertaining comedy. I'm

afraid I approached it in this connection

and I continued to do so. I felt that this

was a very amateurish attempt at some-

thing which I didn's know really hat

was going on, and it was an interlude of

entertainment as far as I'm concerned."

The

role

he played is also

unclear.

" In 1970, however. WerBell told

an Aliants magazine writer, "When you

work for the company, they take care of

you."

"The company" is generally used as a

euphemism

for

the Central

Intelligence

Agency - an arm of government WerBell

says now he has never had anything to do

with, except to sell it some guns.

The

company he was talking about, he says,

was CBS. Over the years, however, Wer-

Bell has spoken often. of his association

with the Company. Producer McMullen

quoted WerBell to the congressmen as say.

ung he had "previous experience" with "the

company:"

"And when I asked him what

company he meant, he said the CLA," Mc-

Mullen said.

"Everybody always pets that impression

says. It is a conclusion that

To questions such as these, WerBell's

standard reply is. "I guess I'm just lucky."

More than just luck, however, WerBell's

propensity for being in the crucial place

at the crucial time seems to stem from a

combination of machismo, the profit mo-

The Old Boy Network - "And don't you

ever kid yourself that there isn't such a

hal!. It is a lonsely structured help want-

ed-situation wanted grapevine. "I became

friends with a bunch of guys who are now

four- and five-star generals." recalls Wer-

Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind

Japanese lines in World War I.

Memorabilia of the OSS days and sub

sequent

adventures hang in

WerBell's

home and in his psyche. The walls of buth

his

upstairs den and downstairs

"war

are decorated with dozens of hunt-

ing (upstairs) and military (downstairs)

weapons. Six unsheathed

are

mounted on the door of the liquor cabinet.

The bigrest war souvenir, though, isn't

way a man of 55 acts after more than 20

British press, seemed second in anticipated

While there are some people who admire

others who don't. Among those others are

WerBell's former business associates, a

group of New York investment bankers

Bennett B.

Armament Corp. (MAC) that the pair had

founded. "He's been headline press all over

And about a referendum

on

Anaco July S - the day before Bahamian

declare Abaco a Ire nation. "We are put-

ting to bear all our activity and friends to

that

duesn't want to go this way,' " says Wer-

Bell.

The accuracy of that assessment of feel..

ing on Abaco can he questioned. Many of

the Abaconians who

originally opposed

separation from the Crown abandoned the

movement as fruitless in December, when

the British government decreed that the

Bahargas - all of the Bahamas - gould

become independent. Nor was there ever

complete opposition throughout Abaco to

Pindling

government and indepen.

elected by the isiand's 6.500 residente, the

one other than Watkins is a Pindling sup

porter and a backer of independence. The

impetus. for the- Free Abaco movement,

both Pindling and Minister of Extenial

Affairs Faul Adderly have charged, comes

frors outside the Bahamag.

"I still think

that what they are basically involved in is

the „sisaling of land,"

Adderly

said in a

recent interview. And indeed, the majority

of the people on Abaco know very little of

WerBell and Marger outside of what they

rend in the British press.

WerBell says his motivations are strictly

anti-communist. A far right-winger - he

described himself to a newsman ag

"to the

"Every goddam single symptem that

was present in Cuba exists in the Bahamas

* he says.

WerBell's opinion of the Pindling gov:

emment and of the Bahamas' politivai cli-

mate is one which meny observers of the

Bahainas do not share. Although the over-

whelming majority of the islanders are

black and have become very assertive con-

office dating fron 1959.

herbell has been Involved in a variety of scrapes,

the latest of which concerned an abortive invasion of Haiti which John Greany

was very such concerned about a year är so ago.

kerbell stated that the Departrent of Defense had just revaied his

security derance be pounds of herbella rivolous behavior" ln the balthan

caper. herbell stated that he intended to "fight it to the Supreme Court", as

he had always kept us and other elevents of the US Governient informed cai

3. Kerbell assed if there waa anything that we could do for him in the

way of interceding for hin with the DOD, and we inforned hin bluatly and in

no uncertain terns that he was strictly on his own, and he could do nothing

he then asked if it would be worthwhile to subpoena Bart Gonzales.

We inforced hin that it was up to hie attorney to make such recorrendations.

herbell seened to get the message, and then offered to keep us advised

regarding an alleged forthcosing attempt on liaiti which is being sponsored by

Rolando Kasferrer, even though Yasferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal

prison. He told werbell that if he wished to pass any inforcation along le

B. Systematic Introduction of Military Judgement

Ly definition the neusralization or defeat of

Communist terrorisn consists of the speciulized application

of inunter insurgency operations by she enployment of intelli-

ence: aspeinlogical operations; hunter-killer operations to

include jungle, nountain, sir, riverine, lorder, and village

sccurity operations: communications: logistics; specialized

training anti equivrent, and other technigues. SIONICS; Inc.

considers that the technigues designed by our Corporation to

neutralize conmunist terrorism in the border areas of Thailand

is based on sound past experience in this field and would lead

to the development of a wide-spread organization and system

within the royal flai Armed Forces (PrA), the Border Patrol

POLiCe (BPP), and the Thai National Police (TYP) to counteract

this treat throughout the country:

Establishment-of

stab ishment of a sisten are organization to neutrali

the Communist threat cannot be accomplished without reliance

on sound and informed military judgement based on proven

techniques. SIONICS, Inc. has pioneerei in the development

of these techniques which permit the systematic development and

usi in analysis and exccution of

§ military and technical judge-

r-ment

The techniques and equipren: developed for this purpose

are resigned and operate for the "usual of normal" case in which

they will be usedsunder combat conditionsas the capability that

accrues from the employment of these techniques and equipment in

unusual or peculiar situations should be considered a bonus

The purpose of thir program will be to strike

the coimurist insurgents where they are rost vulnerable and to

mush the operations of selected Special Operations Hunter/Killer

Teams into present royal Thai Government ongoing Counterinsurgency

Programs based or the proven and historic causes of victory over.

the Corrunists:

Aggressive anti-guerrilla tactics.

Removal of sections of the population thus

depriving insurgents of contact with the people.

Removal of the support of the population.

In attacking Communist terrorist vulnerability

Marting.

the Special gperations Hunter/Killer program will be designed

to operate against the enemy and concentrate on the following

cateyories of insurgent vulnerability:

1. Insurgent base area system which, although.

fragmented, is a coherent complex of combat, combat support, and

combat

service support facilities and activities which erbrace...

populated as well as remote areas. In this, Special Operations

wunter/killer Teams will, in the final phases. of the operation,

be durected to attäck or operate on the perimeters of insurgent

base area systems.

ascert 2. Insurgent corbat units in avoiding prolonged

combat may use escape routes that will subject them ideally to

ambush by Hunter/Killer Teams. In this, the classic principals

of "the hanner and anvil operation" will be employed. Helicopter

6. l'uture Operations

ne the end of phase v the icint should have proved

itsulf as one of the rost effective counter-insurgency programs

available to te RIG. My an example, in 6 months operations

the 72 snipers

of the U.S: 9th Division attained over 600

confirmed kills, the majority of which weis made at night with

the N-14 rifle/Starlight Scope/SIONICS-ilA:-A2 suppressor combin-

ation:

In effecting this admirable record, 1.37 cartridges

were expended per kill.

"Ati the current cost of 286 for. one

rational natch cartridge, this averages to 385 per kill. This

is obviously an oversimplification, but it highlights an extremely

successful and economical rethod of countering connunist terrorism

along the borders of thailand.

is a final note, this type of operation is as yet

in its nascent stages:

Complete operational techniques that will

result from execution of the 12 month NCTTT will undoubtedly

disclose

additional and more effective techniques of killing or

neutralizing communist terrorists in Thailand and will contrikute

inneasurably to bringing stability and RTG sontrol into its

border areas.
