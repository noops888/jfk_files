F. Roberto ECHEVARRIA, Commercial Secretary, Ottawe. Subject
said he had-mct E. only once and that was in Cangda during his trip
there last sumsier just before he went to: Helsinki and Paris for the
AMLASH operation. He said he didn't know where £. was just now,
but thought he was jot in Canada. We asked him to discreetly ask ~
his business partner, who was making a trip to northern New York
State and/or Canada this weekend, to make a phone call to the \
Commercial Mission in Ottawa, and to inquire for £., and/or when

he would be back, etc., if in fact he was not there. He can use
Subject's name or an alleged business matter as the pretext for
calling. He will advise us on the outcome.

G. Pending Trip to Colombia, Subject stated that he planned .
‘to make a trip in the near future to Columbia to buy some emeralds.
‘He will arrange the-trip in order to avoid being away from home
on 7 November, the anniversary of his brother's death, and which
day he understandably wishes to be with his mother and father., The

undersigned is not absolutely sure of this date, but if it is not
correct, it is not far off. A check of our files might clarify this

point,

H. Passports for Sale. Subject said he had recently bought
two Cuban passports In Miami for two friends in Switzerland, whose
passports had run out of pages. Subject is concerned over this
market in passports and stressed the point to us. He said he paid
$50.00 apiece for them. The wholesale price is $25.00, Subject
informed us, He said he would be glad to get some for us if we
desired. We said we would acvise him. He did not know whether
he could get any diplomatic passports or not, but he would discreetly
check on this, Passports are availed used or blank. He thinka the
blanks are the real McCoy and not poor imitations,

6. SECURITY Considerations. There were no incidents of a security
nature to report, The undersigned had coffee in Subject's offices
while the latter made a call to Miami! re{BORDO!s expected visit to 4
Miami, We chatted briefly with Subject's fatter and one of the

and the conversation was polite only.
