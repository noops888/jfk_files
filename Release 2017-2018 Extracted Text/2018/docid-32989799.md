whore the material oxamined appeared to be of interest to the
Bureau photostatic copies of sane were transmitted by letter.

The confidential character of Informant 2 is generally .
understood throughout the Field, In casas where the material
does not appear to be of any value it is destroyed and disposed
of through the regular channels at the Seat of Government.

Very truly yours,

GUY HOPTEL

No

Vas there any destruction of material after the
first week of July?

No.

Knowing that the Eureau had its own disintegrating
facilities, why do you think Mr, Kunkel was requested
to handle the destruction of the material?

Prior to Mr. Kunkel's becoming a Special Agent, he
was a Clerical Employee assigned to the Director's
office. Miss Gandy may have requested his assistance
in the destruction of Ifr. Hoover's personal papers.

Why do you think that such precautions were taken
in the handling and destruction of this material?

The material was that of a prominent deceased
individual and the contents need not be publicized,

Are you assigned to operate the disintegrator
machine?

No, we have employees assigned this duty.

Why did ir. Kunkel ask you and Mr. Dudney to
personally handle the destruction of the late
Director's material?

As Special Agent in Charge, Mr, Kunkel requested
Me. Dudmey and I to handle and destroy all material.
We did so without question.

Early this year an article appeared in a local
newspaper telative to the destruction of material
from the office of Hr. Hoover. Did you read this
article?

discuss the matter at the time I was interviewed

as reflected by the copy of FD-302 in his possession.

DICK was friendly and affable but businesslike
throughout the interview. In a brief initial off-the-record
exchange, DICK explained that he was interested in SCHWEPPE's
knowledge of the “Hunter Project." When SCHWEPPE indicated -
he was not familiar with the term, DICK consulted his notes
to confirm whether SCHVEPPE in fact was the party he intended
to interview. A check by him corroborated that SCHVEPPE's
name had been provided him by the Department of Justice
as an individual with knowledge of "Hunter" and related
projects.

During this initial exchange, SCHWEPPE indicatéd
that his recollection of specifics such as “exactly when?"
and "Did you ever see?" or "When did you first see or learn?”
or "How many times did you see?” based on matérial possibly
seen by him over @ period of several months as far back
as 1958 was limited, DICK agreed and suggested that there
really might be no need to continue the interview, but in
the end he suggested that since all parties were in place,
the interrogation might as well proceed.

He indicated that a transcript of the interview
would be available for review by SCHWEPPE in about a week.
DICK said he would contact SA DALY at FBIHQ at the
appropriate time, On contact on 9/30/75, DICK said the
transcript probably would be available for review in about
aweek. As of 10/15/75, it had not been made available.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
(FBI) SPECIAL AGENT HOMER W. SCHWEPPE BY
SSC_STAFF MEMBER JAMES DICK

On September 23, 1975, after a short orientation
discussion and after advising him of his rights under the
Constitution and reminding him that his appearance was
voluntary, SSC Staff Member James Dick interviewed FBI
Special Agent Homer W. Schweppe in the presence of SSC
stenotypist Susan Hanback regarding his knowledge of
the following: The "Hunter Project," "Bureau Informant
200," "the SAM Survey," "Z Coverage," and opening of mail
by FBI employees.

At the outset Dick asked Schweppe to document his
FBI service. Schweppe responded by listing the following:
Assignments in San Francisco from late 1946 to mid 1947;
in Los Angeles from mid 1947 to mid 1951; at FBI Headquarters
(FBIHQ) from May, 1951, to May, 1958, and again from late
1960 to November, 1961; in the Washington Field Office (WFQ)
of the FBI from May, 1958, on, except for the 1960 to 1961
period just cited.

During the course of the interview Schweppe was
also asked to indicate the nature of his assignments at
FBIHQ. He indicated he was assigned for the main part to
units within the Domestic Intelligence Division dealing
with Soviet military attache personnel and with members
of Elizabeth Bentley's “espionage ring.}'

Dick also queried Schweppe about his knowledge
of the “SAM Survey" (SAM) and "Z Coverage" (Z). He
asked Schweppe whether he knew when "SAH" and "Z" were
initiated, what they consisted of, when they ceased,
when he first became aware of them, and whether he had seen
any results of those projects. Schweppe replied that

"SAM" and "Z" were on 2 need-to-know basis within WFO but
that he in time heard about them through office "shop
talk" and then concluded that those designations indicated
projects in which mail to and/or from the Soviet Union and
Soviet bloc countries was monitored. He said he did
not know when those projects were initiated or when they
terminated. He said that he would have to guess within a
tolerance of two or three years that he first heard of those
projects in the early 1960s. Schweppe said he was called
on from time to time to translate correspondence in German,
which correspondence had been photographed by some source
not identified initially. Schweppe suggested that on later
inquiry about the source of the correspondence he was
informed it was either from "SAM" or "Z," He said he was
unable to recall specifically who so advised him. He felt
it was possible that word was just "passed along" to that
effect, He could not recall whether each specific individual
item was identified in a particular, special manner so as
to tie it in to its source. Schweppe stated that he believes
all such material translated by him was directed to officials
at the Soviet and/or Soviet bioc embassies in Washington,
D. C., and not to any non-diplomatic personnel. Such
translation requirements were quite infrequent, and Schweppe
was not called on to translate any such material within
the past eight or ten years, to the best of his recoliection.

Schweppe said it was his impression that "SAM"
in New York City was handled in space nt one or the other
of New York's airports. He said he was unaware of the
specific arrangements in Washington, D. C. He related that
he was aware that FBI Special Agent dohn De Bettencourt,
since deceased, was directly involved in WFO's "Z Coverage"
project but that he did not know specifically to whom De
Bettencourt was answerable.

U.S. SSC ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES SECRET

Dick asked whether Schweppe was aware of any
mail having been opened by FBI employees in situations other
than the projects referred to above. Schweppe, after making
the observation that Federal law and FBI regulations
prohibit such activity, said he himself had never opened
anyone's mail in his capacity as an FBI employee, that he
never observed any other FBI employee so engaged, and that
he personally was not aware of any specific instances in
which that might hive happened, At this point Schweppe
related that while he was assigned to the Los Angeles
Office, he suspected that a female employee, whose name he
could not recall, might possibly have been engaged in the
surreptitious opening of other people's mail because of
the suspiciongnature of her actions at certain times.
Schweppe added that these were suspicions raised by
circumstantial evidence only.

Dick then presented a hypothetical situation in
which agents on duty might obtain mail posted by an
individual and then proceed to open the same and review
the contents. He asked whether Schweppe was aware of any
such instances. Schweppe acknowledged that the suggested
scenario sounded realistic enough but added that he could
recall no such actual situations. :

During the course of the interview, Schweppe
indicated that he had been assigned to Soviet-related
investigatory matters in WFO until early 1959, after
which he was assigned to tho handling of German, Latin
fmerican, Middle East, and Chinese investigatory matters
at different times.

Schweppe concluded by stating that his knowledge
and recollection of the subject matter constituting the
basis for the inquiry were weak. He reiterated that he
never opened any other person's mail in his capacity as an
FBI employee, that he never witnessed any other FBI employee
opening any such mail, and that he cannot recall ever
being aware of any situation in which mail was opened by
FBI employees, exclusive of the "SAM" and "Z" projects
mentioned above. '

This interview commenced about 10:15 a.m.,
September 23, 1975, and concluded at about 11:15-a.m.
the same day.

By William Safire

WASHINGON, Nov. 19—On Oct. 10,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put his personal signa-
ture_on a document that Jaunched and
Jegitimatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when?
the committee counsel frrst set forth
the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De- ,
partment had existed in 1962; today,*
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robert Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed
their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.”

But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nedy root of this precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone unasked for
thirteen years,

For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wiretap Dr, King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda~
tion? How does the F.B.I. know the
President was consulted or informed? +

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-
Tice, and the wiretapping continued,
he was told by angry newsmen that
the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr. King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis-
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church's political
base. That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha
(Deke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnson’s
personal contact with the F.B.I. in the
witness chair. What did President
Johnson know about the character-
assassination plot and when did he
know it? What conversations took
place between Mr. Deloach and Presi-
dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.
King, or about the use of the F.B.I, in
other intrusions into the lives of

SSH EY Sy cra: 32989799

. the apparent knowleage of Attorn

Sg-over-Up
—
“The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are readily available. A couple of
weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.B.I. man inadvertently started to

biurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 with

General Kennedy. The too-willing wit!
ness was promptly shooshed into si;
lence, and told’ that such informatio:
would be developed only in executive
session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.
That pattern ot containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-
rr

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of p
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the F.B.I,
but the Chirch investigators seem to
be determinetl not to probe too deeply.
"If F.B.I. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity ‘to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.. to spy on political
opponents, who can be brought for.
ward to tell us all about it? H

But that. would cause embarrass-*,
ment to Democrats, and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee's hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.'s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes demure-,
ly—and nobody demands to know!
which network executive made what!
decision under what pressure.

I have been haranguing patient
readers for years about the double
standard applied to Democratic and
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would be laid
before the public in damning detail.

‘Obviously, Democrat Frank Church
is not the man to do it. His. jowl-
shaking indignation is all too selec-
-tive; the trail of high-level responsi-
for the crimes committed against
Dr. King and others is evidently going
to be allowed to cool.

Pity. You'd think that after all the
nation has been through in the past
few years, our political leaders would
have learned that the one thing that
brings you down is the act of cover-

_Attorney General : ke :

SUBJECT: Joseph Kraft burglary

Among the documents from Federal Bureau of Investigation
files provided to my office under a cover memorandum dated
October 7, 1975, there was a memorandum dated July 18, 1973
and titled "Joseph Kraft," This document, along with the others,
was provided to Mr. Kraft's attorneys pursuant to the agreement
of August 5, 1975, for review before the fen furnished
it to the Senate Select Committee.

When Mr. Kraft and his attorneys reviewed the July 18, 1973,
document they raised a question about a reference on page two of
the document which stated:

“On September 4, 1969, Joseph Kraft
advised the Washington Field Office of the
FBI that he left his home (3021 N Street,
N. W., Washington D. C.) at approximately
9:20 P.M. on September 3, 1969, to visit
with former Governor Averell Harriman who
resided a few doors from the Kraft "residence,
At approximately 9:45 P.M. Mrs. Kraft, who
was in the second floor bedroom of the
residence, came down the stairs and found
“the door open.

"Subsequently, it was discovered “by ~~
Mr. and Mrs. Kraft several items of sterling
silver were missing from the dining room and
the pantry which items, according to the .
Krafts, had an estimated value of approximately
$10,000.

"A crime scene search and processing of
the crime scene by the Metropolitan Police
Department produced negative results. No’
forcible entry was noted and Mr. Kraft advised
investigative officers of the Metropolitan

~*~ Police Department that he had probably left
the front door ajar when he acretee the
residence.

"On the morning of September 4, 1969,

the Metropolitan Police Department was advised
by the Washington National Airport Police that
some silverware had been found near one of the
entrances to the terminal at the Washington
National Airport. The silverware was recovered
by the Metropolitan Police Department and
processed for latent fingerprints without
success and the items were returned to Mrs,
Kraft upon her identification of the silverware.
No suspects were developed by either the FBI

. or the Metropolitan Police Department in the
investigation of the matter."

Mr. Kraft does not recall having spoken to the FBI about the
burglary, Documents provided more recently to Mr. Kraft pursuant
to the August 5, 1975, agreement do not shed any light on this
question.

The incident is curious in that the only reference to it comes
in the memorandum of July 18, 1973, discussing a press report about
the activities of John D. Erlichman. Could you have someone look
into this matter for me? The obvious questions are: What other
documents in FBI files say about the September 3, 1969, burglary?
What files of the Bureau or its Washington field office indicate

| about how the conversation about the burglary took place?

During the past year, information contained in FBI Headquarters

viewed the material furnished to the SSC regarding him in
accordance with an agreement between Kraft and the Attorney
General, referred to in paragraph one of the enclosure. As
noted in the enclosure, Kraft, as a result of a review of
information regarding the burglary of his residence on 9/3/69,
raised certain questions.

the Honorable Clarence M..Kelley, the Director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importance
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather
than on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light

in our hearings occurred years and even decades before Directoy

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY,

DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and
gentlemen.

I welcome the interest which this Committee has shown in
the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli
gence and internal security fields.

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States, Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same orl
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.

This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as
possible in responding to your questions and complying with you

requests.

6 of our day-to-day intelligence operations.
vi You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who
8 have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with
9 all major areas of our activities and operations in the national
10 security and intelligence fields.

14 As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of
15 necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I

| 16 eredit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
| 17 hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's

18 record of performance.

19 It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus

20 on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
21 organization,

22 The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the
23 lion's share of public attention and critical comment consti ute

24 an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's Counterintelligence
Programs has reported that in the five basic ones it- found
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,
less than three fourths, were approved.

I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were

being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era

when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative
matters per year.

Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate
and understandable.

The question might well be asked what I had in mind when
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..

What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is
that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what they
felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney General,
the Congress, and the people of the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and,
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such

acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,
and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights. :

There were many calls for action from Members of Congress
and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and other
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

FBI employees aaa the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to countér conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may well)
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet

an imminent threat-to human life .or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to be carried
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by investigatin
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the
ability to prevent? I refer to those instances where there is
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to
human life.

Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt,
the Congress must consider the question of whether or not such

preventive action should be available to the FBI.

These matters are currently being addressed by a task
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI,

and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls cal

to insure that such measures are used in an entirely responsible
manner.

Probably the most important: question here today is what
eee adaee I can give that the errors and abuses which arose
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub-
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as
Director on July 9, 1973.

Today we place a high premium on openness, openness
both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion

in the decision-making process which insures that no future
program ae major policy decision will ever be adopted without a
full and critical review of its propriéty.

Participatory management has become a fact in the FBI.

I have made it known throughout our Headquarters and
Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, regardless of
position or degree of experience, to contribute their thoughts
and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms or
reservations they may have concerning any area of our. operations.

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. “My goal is to achieve maximum
eritical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure.

The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, "as a ‘lightning rod' to deflect improper requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,

considering the context of the request, I believed presented

the appearances of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I have to the
Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years as
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no
one has approached me or made overtures, directly or otherwise,
to use the FBI for partisan political or other improper
purposes.

I can assure you that I would not for a moment consider
honoring any such request.

I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI
I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney General and
the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including
those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and|
practices, These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the. FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means...

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the
character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

I am proud of the 19,000 men and women with whom it is
my honor to serve today. Their dedication, their professionalils!

their standards, and the self-discipline which they personally

demand of themselves and expect of their associates are the

2458

nation's ultimate assurance of proper and responsible conduct
at all times by the FBI.

The Congress and the members of this Committee in
particular have gained a great insight into the. problems
confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields,
problems which all too often we have left to resolve without
sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or the Congress
itself.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even
to the Executive Branch.

The Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised.

An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully
committed to maximum participation with the members of that
Subcommittee.

I laud their efforts. However, those efforts are of very
recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.

One of the greatest benefits of the study this Committee
has made is the expert knowledge you have gained of the complex

problems confronting the FBI. But I respectfully submit that

those benefits are wasted if they do not lead “to the next step,
a step that I believe is absolutely essential , a legislative
charter, expressing Congressional determination of intelligence
jurisdiction for the FBI.

Action to resolve the problems confronting us in the
security and intelligence fields is urgently needed; and it
must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither the Cangress
nor the public can afford to look the other way, leaving it to
the FBI to do what must be done, as too often has occurred in
the past.

This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of|
our performance.

I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative
process and, thereby, would take over what historically have
been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast
them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con-
gressional oversight or Executive decision.

The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable determination

statement that the Congress finds | to be responsive to both
the will and the needs of the American people.

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police officer, a
career police officer. In’my police experience, the must
frustrating of all problems that I have discovered facing
law enforcement in this country, Federal, state, and local, is
when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.

It must’ be sufficiently flexible that it does not stifle
the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly address the demonstrated problems of the past;
yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times change and

so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive

The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced
the formulation of operational guidelines governing our
intelligence activities does not in any manner diminish the need
for legislation. The responsibility for conferring juris-
diction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals which

question the need for intelligence gathering, “suggesting that
information needed for the prevention of Raeienae can be
acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations.

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence Peeper may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence
for prosecution. Since the investigation normally follows
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well be
not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government: has enough information to meet any future crisis
or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on

our anticipation of those criminal acts, Anticipation,

in turn, is dependent on advance information, that is, intelli-
gence.

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues,
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need
for intelligence work can be documented to the full satisfactio
of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is n
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful,
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee or
its successors in this important task.

In any event, you have my unqualified assurance as
Director that we will carry out both the letter and the spirit
of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

That is the substance of my prepared statement.

- I would also like to say extemporaneously that I note
that on this panel are some gentlemen who were on the Judiciary
Committee which heard my testimony at the time I was presented
to them for candidacy as Director of the FBI. At that time
I took very seriously the charge which may possibly result
in the deliberation of this Committee and of the full Senate.
I have been well aware of the problems of the FBI since that
time. I have also been well aware of the capabilities of

the FBI to discharge those responsibilities. I don't take

have pledged myself to do what is good and proper. I say this
not as a self-serving statement Lae in order that we might
place in context my position within the FBI. I could seek
sanctuary and perhaps a safe sanctuary by saying during the
period these things occurred I was with the local police ~-
department in Kansas City, Missouri. Prior to that time,
however, I was in the FBI.

During the time I was with the FBI, during the time I
was with the police department, I continued enouancee that
period a close acquaintance with and a strong affection for
the FBI.

I only want to point out that based on those years, based
on those observations, we have here a very fine and very
sensitive and a very capable organization. I feel that there
is much that can still be done. I know that we are not withou
fault. I know that from those experiences I have had. We
will not be completely without fault in the future. But I
assure you that we look upon this inquiry, we look upon any
mandate which you may feel you have, that you should look at -7
this is good and proper, and we do not intend -- I only want
to place in your thinking the fact that _ have here a
matchless organization, one which I continue to say was

not motivated in some of these instances, and in most of

them, and I cannot justify some, that the motivation was of the

only putting in your thinking my objective observations as
a citizen who is somewhat concernea about the future of this
organization. It is too precious for us to have it in
a condition of jeopardy.

Thank you very much.

The Chairman. Thank you, Director Kelley.

I want to turn first to Senator Hart who won't be able
to remain through the whole morning. I think he has one

qnestion he would like to ask.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Mathias and I have Judiciary Committee hearings at 10:30.

Iahve several questions, and I'm sure they'll be
covered by others, but the ones that I have is a result of
reading your testimony and listening to it this morning, and
it relates to your comment at the foot of eee and at the
top of 11.

There you are indicating that you caution us about
extending the court's role in the early stages of investigation!
suggesting that this might take us beyound the role comtemplate
for the courts under the Constutution.

Now as you have said, aside from the so-called national
security wiretap problem, the main focus of our discussions
and concern has been on the possibility requiring court
approval for the use of informants, informants directed to
penetrate and report on some group.

a And one of the witnesses yesterday, Professor Dorsen,
pointed our that really those informants are the most pervasive
type of an eavesdropping device. It is a human device. It's
really, an informant is really more intrusive on my privacy
than a bug or a tap because he can follow me anywhere. He
can ask me questions to get information the government would
like to have.

Now we certainly involve the courts in approval of the

wiretaps for physical searches with the intent of the drafters

of the Constitution to have a:neutral third party magistrate
screen use of certain investigative techniques. And the
informant is such a technique. He functions per of like a
general warrant, and I don't see why requiring court approval
would violate the role envisaged for the courts.

And as I leave, I would like to get one reactions -
my feelings.

Mr. Kelley. I do not feel that there is any use of the
informant in intrusion, which is to this extent objectionable.
It has of course been approved, the concept of the informant,
by numerous court decisions.

Let us go down not to the moral connotation of the use
of the informant,

I think, as in many cases, that is a matter of balance.
You have only very few ways of solving crimes. You have
basically in the use of the informant, I think, the protectiaqn
of the right of the victim to be victimized. You have within
the Constitution certain grants that are under ordinary
circumstances abrogation of rights. The right of search and
seizure, which, of course, can't be unreasonable, but none-
theless, you have the right.

I think that were we to lose the right of the informant,
we wauld lose to a great measure our capability of doing our
job.

Now I'm not arguing with you, Senator, that it is not an

‘unusual procedure. I'm not even going to say that it is not
an intrusion, because it is. But it has to be one. I think
that is by virtue of the benefits must be counted.

We don't like to use it. We don't like the problems that
are attendant. We take great care.

Now you say about the court having possibility taking
jurisdiction over them and guiding. I think that possibly we
could present the matter to the court but what are they going
to do insofar as monitoring their effort? Are they going to
have to follow it all the way through?

Also, there is, of eee urgency in the other contacts.
Must the court be contacted for each and approval of the court
given for each contact?

There are a great many problems insofar as administration
of it.

I frankly feel, and again, all I can do is give you my
idea -- I frankly feel that there is a Pres control ove.
the informants as we now exercise it today. Yes, there are
going to be some who will get beyond our control, but this
is going to- happen no matter what you do.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I appreciate your
reaction.

I was not suggesting that there is consideration here -to
prohibit informants. I was reflecting a view that I felt and

hold that the use of an informant does require some balance, as

you yourself said, and I would be more comfortable with a
thira party making a judgment as to whether the intrusion is
warranted by the particular circumstance. But I do understand
‘your position.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hart.

(Senator Hart leaves the hearing room.)

The Chairman. Senator Baker, do you have questions?

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

Mr. Kelley, I have a great respect.for you and your
organization and I personally regret that the organization is
in political distress, but we've both got to recognize that
it is, along with other agencies and departments of the
government.

I think you probably would agree with me that even though
that is extraordinarily unpleasant and in many respects
unfortunate, that it also has a plus side. That is, it gives
us an indication of peal future direction and the opportunity,
at least, to improve the level of competency and service of
the government itself.

With that hopeful note, would you be agreeable then to
volunteering for me any suggestions you have on how to improve
the responsiveness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or
indeed, for any other law enforcement agencies of the government

to the Congress, to the Attorney General, to the President, and

‘beyond that, would you give me any suggestions you have on
how you would provide the methods, the access, the documents,
the records, the authority, for the Congress to perform its
essential, I believe, essential oversight responsibility to
see that these functions, these delicate functions are being
undertaken properly?

And before you answer, let me tell you two or three thing:
I am concerned about.

It hasn't been long ago that the FBI Director was not
even confirmed by the Senate of the United States. I believe
you are the first one to be confirmed hy the Senate of the
United States. I think that is a movement in the right
direction. I think the FBI has taken on a stature that, an
additional importance that requires it to have closer supervision
and scrutiny by us.

At the same time I rather doubt that we can become
involved in the daily relatianship between you and the Attorney
General.

Therefore, I tend to believe that the Attorney General
needs to be more directly involved in the operations of the
FBI.

I would appreciate any comments on that.

Second, I rather believe that major decisions of the
intelligence community and the FBI ought to be in writing, so

that the Congress can, if it needs to in the future, take a

look at these decisions and the process by which they were
made to decide that you are or you are not a ee your
services diligently.

I don't think you can have oversight unless you have
access to records, and in many cases records don't exist
and in some cases the people who made those decisions are now
departed and in other cases you have conflicts.

How would you suggest: then that you improve the quality
of service of your agency? How would you propose that you

increase the opportunity for oversight of the Congress of the

- United States? What other suggestions do you have for improving

the level of law enforcement in the essential activity that
is required?

Mr. Kelley. I would possibly be repetitious in answering
this Senator, but I get a great deal of pleasure from telling
what I think is necessary and what I hope that I have followed,
one which is beyond my control, but which I think is very
important is that the position of Director, the one to which
great attention should be paid in choosing the man who will
properly acquit himself.

I feel that the Judiciary Committee, at least in going
over me, did a pretty good job. I feel that it is most
necessary that care be taken that his philosophy, his means
of management, his facility to adapt to change, his tendency

toward consulting with other members of the official family,

that he be willing to, for example, go through oversight with
no reticence, and that I think that he should be chosen very
carefully.

I think further that he should be responsible for those
matters which indicate impropriety or illegality.

Senator Baker. Could you stop for just a second? Who
does he work for? Does the Director, in your view, work for
the President of the United States, for the Attorney General,
for the Justice Department, for the Executive Branch?’

Who does the executive of the FBI, the Director of the
FBI, be responsible to, who should he be responsible to?

Mr. Kelley. Jurisdictionally, to the Attorney General,
but I think this is such an important field of influence that
it is not ‘at all unlikely that we can expand it to the
judiciary, the legislative, and of course, we are under the
Attorney General.

Senator Baker. Do you have any problems with the idea
of the President of the United States calling the Director of
the FBI and asking for performance of a particular task?

Does that give you any difficulty? Or dq ydu think that
the relationship between the FBI Director and the President
is such that that is desirable, or should it be conduited
through the Attorney General?

Mr. Kelley. I think it should be in the great majority

of the cases conduited through the Attorney General. There

has been traditionally some acceptance of the fact that if
the President wants to see and talk with the Director, he
may do so, call him directly.

It has been my practice in such an event to thereafter
report to the Attorney General, whoever it might be, that I
have been called over and I discussed and was ‘told. And this
was revealed in full to them,

Senator Baker. I suppose we could pass a statute that
says the President has to go through the Attorney General,
although I rather ‘suspect it would be a little presumptuous,

But to go the next step, do you think it is necessary
for the pursuit of effective oversight on the part of the
Congress, to have some sort of document written, ce at least
some sort of account of a Presidential order or an order of
the Attorney General given to a Director of the FBI?

Do you think that these things need to be handled in
a-more formal way?

Mr. Kelley. Personally, it would be my practice in
the event I receive such an order, to request that it be
documented. This is a protection as well as a clarification
as to whether or not it should be placed as part of legislation.
I frankly would like to reserve that for some ae considera-
tion.

I don't know whether it would be, but I think that it

can be worked very easily.

Senator Baker. Mr. Kelley, Attorney General Levi, I
believe, has already established some sort of agency or
function within the Department that is serving as the equivalent
I suppose, of an Inspector General of the Justice Department,
including the FBI.

Are you familiar with the steps that Mr. Levi has
taken in that respect? I think he calls it the Office of
Professional Responsibility. i

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir, I'm familiar with it.

Senator Baker. Do you have any comment on that? Will
you give us any observations as to whether you think that
will be useful, helpful, or whether it will not be useful or
helpful, how it affects the FBI, how you visualize your
relationship: to it in the future?

Mr. Kelley. I don't object to this, which is to some
extent an oversight within the Department of Justice under the
Attorney General.

Frankly, it just came out. I have not considered it
completely, but to the general concept, yes, I very definitely
subscribe,

Senator Baker. How would you feel about extending that
concept of government-wide operation, a national Inspector
General who is involved with an oversight of all of the
agencies of Govecnment as they interface with the Constitutional]

protected rights of the individual citizen? Would you care

to comment on that, or would you rather save that for a while?
Mr. Kelley. I would like to reserve that one.
Senator Baker, I'm not surprised. Would you think about
it and let us know what you think about it?
Mr. Kelley. I will..
Senator Baker. All right. Mr. Chairman, thank you very

much,

The Chairman, Senator Huddleston.

» Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Kelley, you describe on page 4 the conditions that
existed when much of the abuse that we have talked about during
this inquiry occurred, indicating that the people within the
Bureau felt like they were doing what was expected of them
by the President, by the Attorney General, the Congress and
the people of the United States.

Does not this suggest that there has been a reaction
there to prevailing attitudes that might have existed in the
country because of certain circumstances rather than any
clear and specific direct instructions that might have been
received from proper authorities? And if that is the case,
is it possible in developing this charter, this guideline,
to provide for that kind of specific instruction?

Mr. Kelley. I think so, yes. I think that they can

logically be incorporated and that --

Senator Huddleston, You can see there would be a continu

8 Senator Hart was discussing, that is whether or not we can

9 provide sufficient guidelines would replace a decision by the
10 court in determining what action might be proper and specific-
11 ‘ally in protecting individual's rights, can't we also
12 |) provide the restrictions and guidelines and the various

13 techniques that might be used?

WARD & PAUL

14 For instance, supposing we do establish the fact, as

15 has already been done, that informants are necessary and

16 desirable. Mow do we keep that informant operating within the
17 | proper limits so that he in fact is not violating individual
18 rights?

19 Mr. Kalley. Well, of course, much of the reliance must

20 || be placed on the agent and.the supervision of the FBI to assure
21 || that there is no infringement of rights.
22 Senator Huddleston. But this is an aware we've gotten

23 }} into some difficulty in the past. We have assumed that the

in many cases it has gone beyond what would appear to have been
necessary to have addressed the original threat.

How do a keep within the proper balance there?

Mr. Kelley. Well,.actually, it's just about like any
other offense. It is an invasion of the other individual's
right and it is by an officer and an FBI pie is an officer.
There's the possibility of eriminal prosecution against him.

This is one which I think might flow if he counsels”
the informant.

Now insofar as his inability to control the informant,

I don't suppose that would warrant prosecution, but there is
still supervisory control over that agent and over that
informant by insisting that control is exercised on a continuing
basis.

Senator Huddleston. It brings up an interesting point
as to whether or not a law enforcement agency ought to be
very alert to any law violations of its own members or anyone
else.

If a White House official asks the FBI or someone to do
something unlawful, the question seems to me to occur as to
whether or not that is not a violation that should be reported
by the FBI.

Mr. Kelley. I think that any violation which comes to
our attention should either be handled by us or the proper

authority.

of those actions to keep them from going beyond aaae

Senator Huddleston. But it could be helped by periodic
review. l

Mr. Kelley. We do, on an annual basis, review the
activities of our 59 offices through that same Inspection
Division, and they have a clear charge to go over this as well
as other matters.

Senator Huddleston. Mr. Kelley, you pointed. out the
difference in the approaches when gathering intelligence, in
gathering evidence after a crime has been committed.

Would there be any advantage, or would it be feasible to
attempt to separate these functions within the mene in the
departments, for instance, with not having a mixing of
gathering intelligence and gathering evidence? Are the techni
definable and different?:

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think they are compatible. I
see no objection to the way that they are now being handled
on a management basis. I think, as a matter of fatt, it is
a very fine association whereby the intelligence, stemming as
it does from a substantive violation, is a natural complement.

Senator Huddleston. Now, another area, the FBI furnishes
information to numerous government agencies.

Is this properly restricted and controlled at the present
time in your judgment as to just who can ask the FBI for

information, what kind of information they can ask for, and

now?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know that we can ourselves judge
in all cases whether or not there is good and sufficient asa
for an Agency to inquiry. I think that there should be a
very close delineation by the agencies as to what they're
going to ask for, but I think that we ‘do have sufficient rules
that at least to us we are satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. You're confident that the information
your agency supplies is not being misused, to the detriment
of the rights of any individuals.

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I'm only confident in what I
do myself. I would say that I am satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. I was wondering whether some
inclusion ought to be made in whatever charter is made as to
who specifically can request, what limits ought to be placed
on what the request, and what they can do with it after they
get it.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Senator Huddleston. I have some concern about the fact

‘that in intelligence gathering, you gather, you are just

bound to gather a great deal of information about some
individual that is useless as far. as the intent of the intelli-|
gence gathering is concerned, but might be in some way embarras
sing or harmful to the individual, whether or not there's any
effort to separate this kind of information out of a person's
file that is really initiated for a purpose, for a specific
purpose unrelated to this information.

Is there any effort, or could any direction be given to
doing that?

Mr. Kelley. We would be very happy to work under the
guidelines or rules or anything else to purge material which
is extraneous, irrelevant, or for any other reason objection-
able.

Senator Huddleston. And how about the length of time
that these files are kept in the agency?

Mr. Kelley. We are willing to work within that framework,
too.

Senator Huddleston. I think that might be done.

Now, I think in developing the chain of command, so to
speak, it certainly would be very difficult to prevent the
President of the United States from calling up the head of
the FBI or anyone else and discussing any law enforcement
problem he might so desire, and perhaps even give direction
to the agency.

But how about that? What about White House personnel

informants. We'll discuss techniques, we'll discuss our
present activities. I think this is the only set that we can
exchange our opinions and get accomplished what you want to
accomplish and what I want to accomplish.

Senator Huddleston. I feel that is an important aspect
of it because even though you have a charter which gives broad
direction for all the guidelines and to the types of projects
that enter into it, if we don't get down to specifics, such
things as how intelligence is to be collected, how evidence

is to be collected, what is done after it is collected, this

type of thing, it seems to me we are leaving a wide gap

again for the Bureau to assume that it has total instruction
and total permission to move in a certain aitect on and go
beyond what is intended or what was authorized.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Director.

The Chairman. Senator Goldwater?

Senator Goldwater. Mr. Kelley, as part of the FBI
electronic surveillance of Dr. King, several tapes of
specific conversations, and later a composite King tape were
produced.

Are these tapes still in the possession of the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by you?

Mr. Kelley. No, sir.

staff, to your knowledge?

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think that they have been reviewed]
I know that at least some have reviewed it within the area of
this particular section. There has been no review of them
since I came to the FBI, I can tell you that.

Senator Goldwater. Would these tapes be available to
the Committee if the Committee felt they would like to hear
them?

Mr. Kelley. This, Senator Goldwater, is a matter which is
of, as I said before, some delicacy, and there would have to i
be a discussion of this in an executive session.

The Chairman. I might say in that connection that the
Committee staff gave some consideration to this matter and
decided that it would compound the original error for the
staff to review the tapes, because that would be a still
further invasion of privacy, and so the staff refrained from
insisting on obtaining the tapes, believing that it was
unnecessary, and quite possibly improper, in order to get at
what.we needed to know about the King case.

So the staff did refrain, and for that reason the issue
never came to a head. I just wanted to lay that information
before the Senator.

Senator Goldwater. I realize that's a prerogative of
the staff, but it's also the prerogative of the Committee if,

and I'm not advocating it, if we wanted to hear them to

ourselves whether Mr. Hoover was off on a wild goose chase
or whether there was, in effect, some reason. Again, I am
not advocating it, I am merely asking a question. They would
be available if the Committee took a vote to hear them and
decided on it.

Mr. Kelley. I don't think it would be within my juris-
diction to respond to this, Senator. It would have to be the
Attorney General.

Senator Goldwater. I see.

Now, are these tapes and other products of surveillance
routinely retained even after an individual ceased to be a
target of inquiry?

Mr. Kelley. "they are retained usually for ten years.

Senator Goldwater. Ten years.

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. What is the future value, if any,
to the Bureau of retaining such information?

Mr. Kelley. If there be guidelines that set out a
destruction or erasure,we will abide by it. We will, on those
occasions where we think that matters might come up within
that period of time which may need the reténtion of them, we
will express our opinion at that time, but other than that
we would be guided by guidelines.

Senator Goldwater. Is it your view that legitimate

law enforcement needs should outweigh privacy considerations

with respect to retention of such information, or do we need
the clear guidelines on the destruction of these materials
when the investigation purposes for which they were collected.
have been served?

Mr. Kelley. We feel that there should be a good close
look at the retention of material, and we would of course like
to have an input. But we welcome consideration of this.

Senator Goldwater. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you very much.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

Senator Mondale?

Senator Mondale. Mr. Director, it seems to me that the
most crucial question before the Congress is to accept the
invitation of the FBI to draw Congressionally imposed lines,
limits of authority so the FBI will know clearly what you can
and cannot do, so you will not be subject to later judgments,
and the question is, where should that line be drawn?

As you know, in 1924 when the FBI was created, and
Mr. Stone later became the Chief Justice, he drew the line at
criminal law enforcement. He said that never again will we
go beyond the authority-imposed upon us to get into political
ideas. We will stay in the area of law enforcement.

Would you not think it makes a good deal of sense to
draw the guidelines ina way that your activities are

restricted to the enfomcement of the law, investigations of

erime, investigations of conspiracies to commit crime rather
than to leave this very difficult to define and control area
of political ideas?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know whether I understand your last

statement of involving the area of political ideas. I: say tha
I feel that certainly we should be vested otal cheuia continue 1
in the field of criminal investigations as an investigatory
objective. These are conclusions, of course, which are based
on statutes in the so-called security field, national or
foreign.

These are eximinal violations. I feel that they should
be in tandem. I feel, having worked many years in this
atmosphere, that you have more ears and eyes and you have
more personnel working together, covering the same fields..

I do not think there should be a separation of the intelligence
Matters, because it is a concomitant. It naturally flows
from the investigation of the security matters and the
criminal.

Senator Mondale. Mr. Kelley, what:Mr. Stone said was-
this, that the Bureau of investigation is not concerned
with political or other opinions of individuals. It is
concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws
of the United States. When the police system goes beyond

these limits, it is dangerous to proper administration of

justice and human liberty.

10 I don't know what Mr. Stone was thinking of entirely

How can ‘you, from among other things, be protected from
criticism later on that you exceeded your authority or didn't

Mr. Kelley. It might well be, Senator, that ten years
from now a Director of the FBI will be seated here and will be
eriticized for doing that which today is construed as very
acceptable,

Senator Mondale. Correct. And I have great sympathy
for the predicament the FBI finds itself in.

Mr. Kelley. And the Director.

Senator Mondale. And the Director especially, and that is

why I think it's in the interest of the FBI to get these lines

to do things, or when, after the fact, people with good 20/20
hindsight can criticize you or the Bureau, that you can say
well, here are the standards that you gave us, and they speciti¢d
ally say this, and that is your answer. We have to live by

the law. If we don't define it specifically,it seems to me
that these excesses could reoccur, because I don't think it's
possible to define them, and the FBI is inevitably going to

be kicked back and forth, depending on personal notions of what
you should have done.

Don't you fear that?

i al Mr. Kelley. Not too much, Senator. I think we learned a

protection. It's a matter of balance. Even in the Fourth
Amendment, for example, which protects the right of privacy, it

does not prohibit searches and seizures. JI mention, it only

I came from the police fiedd. What is more restrictive
to more people than traffic regulation? But what would be
more chaotic is of you did not have traffic regulation. We
do have to , in order to love in the complexities and
intricacies of today's life, have to give up some of our
rights.

Senator Mondale. There's no such right in the Consti-

under court warrant.

Did you mean to go beyond that?

Mr. Kelley. That's right.

Senator Mondale. That you should be able to go beyond
that?

Mr. Kelley. No, no. I do not mean that we should ever
go beyond a Constitutional right guarantee.

Senator Mondale. Well, would you say, Mr. Kelley, that
that sentence might have been inartful in your speech?

Mr. Kelley. I said that if it was misunderstood, I

yes, it was inartful.

Saying something different, that it was taken to mean something
different than I think you intended.

What you are saying is that in the exercise of your law
enforcement powers, the rights of individuals is determined
by the laws and the courts, but the courts, in the handling
of those issues, have to balance rights and other values.

That's what you're essentially saying, is that correct?

The Chairman. Senator Hart.

Senator of Colorado. Mr. Kelley, in response to
a question by Senaotr Mondale, one.of his first questions about
laying down guidelines, it seems to me what you were saying was
we could work together. That is to say the Bureau and the
Congress, lay down guidelines that would not Eee
hamper you from investigations of crime control in the
country.

But I think implicit in his question was also an area
that you didn't respond to, and that is how as you, what kind
of guidelines do you lay down to protect you and the Bureau
from political pressure, the misuse of the Bureau by political
figures, particularly in the White House?

And we've had indications that at least two of your
predecessors, if not more, obviously were corrupted and Mr.
Gray was under great pressure from the White House to use
the facilities af the Bureau and their’ capabilities to accomplilsh
some plititcal end.

Well, it seems to me you were arguing in favor of fewer
restrictions so you could get on with your job, but that is
not what Senator Mondale and the rest of us are interested in.

What .Kindof restrictions can we lay down to protect you
from political pressures? I'd be interested in that sign of the

coin, if you would.

Mr. Kelley. I would welcome any guidelines which would

be that they are well defined in there. But I welcome any

Senator Hart of Colorado. And that's a problem the
Congress ought to address?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Senator Hart of Colorado, The Committee received a
letter from the Department of Justice a couple of days, the
Assistant Attorney General asking our cooperation in carrying
out the investigation or their efforts to review the investi-~
gation conducted by the FBI into the death of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in order to determine whether that investigation
should be re-opened. They asked our cooperation, they asked
for our transcripts, the testimony before the Committee, all
material provided to the Committee by the FBI which relates
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

I guess my question is this: Why is the Justice Depart-

ment asking this Committee for FBI files?

FBI?

just ask --

program and you said you made a detailed study of COINTELPRO
activities and reached the following conclusions, and I quote:

“The purpose of these counter-intelligence programs was
to prevent dangerously and potentially deadly acts against
individuals, organizations and institutions both public
and private across the United States."

Now we had an FBI informant in the other day before this
Committee and he stated he told the FBI on a number of
occasions he planned violent acts against black people in
groups. And yet, he said few, if any, instanced in which the
FBI actually prevented violence from taking place.

How does his testimony square with your statement that
I have quoted? :

Mr. Kelley. It doesn't, and I don't know if any of
his statements contrary to what we have said is the truth.

We don't subscribe to what he said. We have checked into it
and we know a no instances where, for example, 15 minutes
and that type of thing has been substantiated.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You're saying the testimony
he gave us under oath was not accurate?

Mr. Kelley. Right.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You also said in that statement

not conceal from superior authorities the fact that the FBI

was engaged in neutralizing and disruptive tactics against

revolutionary and violence-prone groups.

Now the Committee has received testimony that the New
Left COINTELPRO programs was not in fact told to higher
authorities, the Attorney Gereral and Congress.

Do you have any information in this regard?

I know in that statement you cite onw or two instances,
but in terms of the bulk of COINTEL programs, the record
seems to date at least to be clear that there was not systematilc
information flowing upward through the chain of command to
Director Hoover's superiors?

Mr. Kelleyi May I ask that I be given the opportunity
to substantiate that with documentation?

Senator Hart of Colorado. ‘sure.

Mr... Kelley: Or respond to it.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Dorector Kelley, just in
passing, do you agree with the statement made by President
Ford that those responsible for harassing and trying to destroy
Dr. King should be brought to justice.

Mc. Kelley. Those who directly responsible and upon whese orders
the activities were taken responsible. I don't know if he intended to say
that, but if he did not, I would say that it would be more proper. Insofar
as my own opinion is concerned, that it be centered on those who said
to do it and those who are responsible.

I.took the responsibility for any such program and I

don't expect that those under me would be not acting in

some reservation, but they do it on my orders. I accept that
responsibility .

I think that it should rest on those who instructed that
that be done.

Senator Hart of Colorado. But you agree that the people
who give the orders should be brought to justice.

The Chairman. Aren't they all dead?

The Chairman. Not quite?

Mr. Kelley. Not quite,

Senator Hart of Colorado. That's all, Nr. Chairman.

The Chairman, Thank you, Senator.

Director Kelley, in the Committee's review of the
COINTELPRO program and other political involvements of the
FBI, it seems to me that we have encountered two or three
basic questions.

Since the investigation is over insofar as the Committee
is concerned, we're now turning our attention to remedies for
the future, what I would think would be our constructive
legislative work, it is very important that we focus on what
we learned in that investigation.

And one thing that we have learned is that Presidents of

the United States have from time to time ordered the FBI to

obtain for them certain kinds’ of information by exercising the
necessary surveillance to obtain .and to have a purely
political chacaeeee that they simply wanted to have for their
own personal purposes,

I think that you would agree that that is not a proper
function of the FBI,,and you agree.

Yet it's awfally difficult for anyone in the FBI,
including the Director, to turn down a President of the United
States if he receives a direct order from the President. It
is always possible, of course, to say no, and if you insist,
Iwill resign. But that puts a very hard burden on any man
serving in your position, particularly if the President puts
a good face on the request and makes it sound plausible or
even invents some excuse. It is always easy for him to say,
you know, I am considering Senator White for an important
position in my administration, and I need to know more about
his activities, particularly of late. I've had some cause
for concern and I want to be certain ‘that there is nothing in
his record that would later embarrass me, and I just want you
to keep careful track of him and report to me on what he's
been doing lately. :

It's difficult for you to say back to the President, Mr.
President, that's a very questionable activity for the FBI,
and I frankly don't believe that you've given me the real

reason why you want this man followed. I think his opposition

5 your office and the FBI from political exploitation in this

6 basic charter that we write.

7 Now, I want your suggestions, but let's begin with one

8 or two of mine. I would like your response.

oT If we were to write into the law that any order.given you

10 either by the President or by the Attorney General should be
il transmitted in writing and should clearly state the objective

12 | and purpose of the request and that the FBI would maintain

WARD & PAUL

13 | those written orders and that furthermore ‘they would be

14 available -to any oversight committee of the Congress. If the
+15 joint committee on intelligence is established, that committee
16 || would have access to such a file.

17 So that the committee itself would be satisfied that

18 orders were not being given to the FBI that were improper or

19 unlawful.

20 What would you think of writing a provision of that kind
21 into a charter for the FBI? :

22 Mr, Kelley. I would say writing into the law any order
23 issued by. the President that is a request for action by the

24 Attorney General should be in writing, is certainly, in my

contemplation of this there would be some that will say yes
or some that will say no, but I think we could define an
area where you are trying to cure the abuses and we could
do that.

Now as to the availability to any oversight committee
of Congress, I would say generally that I certainly would have
no objection to this, but I again, there may be some request
for something of high confidentiality that the President might
put in writing such as some national or foreign security
matter.

I would like to have such a consideration be given a
great deal of thought and that the oversight committee review
be conditioned with that possibility. I don't think it would
present a problem.

I have said previously that I feel I can discuss every-
thing except the identity of the informants to the oversight
committee. I welcome that.

The Chairman. Well, that has been of course the way we
proceeded with this Committee. It has worked pretty well,

I think,

Now Senator Goldwater brought up a question on the
Martin Luther King tapes, I would like to pursue that question]

If these tapes do not contain any evidence that needs

to be preserved for ongoing criminal investigations, and since

Dr. King has long since been violently removed from the scene,

why are they preserved? Why Tate they simply destroyed?

Is there a problem that we can help through new law to enable
the FBI to remove from its files so much of this information
that is has collected that it is no longer needed or may never
have connected the person with any criminal activity?’ And
yet, all of that information just stays there in the files
year after year.

What can we do? How can a law be changed? If that's
not the problem, then what is? Why are these tapes still down
there at the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Well, of course, we do have the rule that
they are maintained ten years, Wow why the rule is your
question and why right now are they maintained? Since we
ado maintain everything since the inquiry has started and until
that's lifted, we can't destroy anything.

I would say that this is a proper area for guidelines

some flexibility and I know that's a broad statement but there
might be some areas wherein that the subject of the investigation
himself may want them retained because it shows his innocence.
I think you have to deliberate this very carefully, but
it can he done and we = willing to be guided by those
rules’,
The Chairman, Let me ask you this. The FBI is conducting

thousands of investigations every year on possible appointees

to Federal positions. As a matter of fact, the ea time I
ever see an FBI agent is when he comes around and flashes his
badge and asks me a question or two about what I know of Mr.
so and so, who's being considered for an executive office.

And we have a very brief conversation in which -I tell him that
as far as I know, he's a loyal and patriotic citizen, and that
is about the extent of it.

Then when this file is completed and the person involved
is either appointed or not appointed, what happens to that
file? I know it's full of all kinds of gossip because it is
in the nature of the investigation to go out to his old
neighborhoods and talk to everybody who might have known him.

What happens to the file? Is that just retained forever?

Mr. Kelley. We have some capability of destroying some
files and they are rather lengthy insofar as retention. We
have some archival rules which govern the retention of mateial
and is developed in cases involving certain members of the
Executive Branch of the government.

I see no reason why this would not be a proper area
for consideration of legislation. i

The Chairman. Can-you give me any idea of how much ~~
do you have records that would tell us how much time and money
is being spent by the FBI just in conducting these thousands
of routine investigations on possible Presidential appointments

to Federal offices?

Mr. Kelley. I feel confident we can get it. I do not
have it now, but if you would like to have the annual cost
for the investigation of Federal appointees --

The Chairman. Yes. Plus, you know, plus any other
information that would indicate to us what proportion of the
time and effort of the FBI was absorbed in this kind of
activity.

Mr. Kelley. I can tell you it is relatively small, but

Mz can get you, I think, the exact amount of time and the

approximate expense.

The Chairman. I wish you would do that because this is
a matter we need nioxe information about. And when you supply
that data to the Committee, would you also supply the number
of such investigations each year?

You know, I don't expect you to go back 20 or 25 years,
but give us a good idea of the last few years. For example,
enough to give us an idea of how much time and how broad the
reach of these investigations may be.

Mr, Kelley. Through '70?

The Chairman. That would be sufficient, I would think.

tg other matter that is connected to this same subject
that I would like your best judgment on is whether these
investigations could not be limited to offices of sensitivity.

That is to say where legitimate national security interest might|

be involved so that there is a reason to make a close check on

past associations, attitudes and expressions of belief.

I have often wondered whether we couldn't eliminate
routine Federal offices that are not particularly sensitive
in the national security sense from the reach of these FBI
checks.

And so when you respond to the series of questions, I
wish you would include the offices that are now covered by
such checks and give us an idea of how far down into the
Pederal bureaucracy this extends.

Could you do that?

Mr, Kelley. Yes, sir.

fhe Chairman. Fine,

Now there is a vote. The vote always comes just at
the wrong time, but Mr. Schwarz wants to ask you some additional]
questions for the record, and there may be other questions,
too that would be posed by the staff, after which I will ask
Mr. Schwarz to adjourn the hearings. It looks like we're going
to be tied up on the floor with votes.

But before I leave I want to thank you for your testimony,
lir. Kelley, and to express my appreciation to you for the
way you have cooperated with the Committee in the course of
its investigation during the past months.

10 and intelligence~gathering agency, and take affirmative steps

13 Now, by that you mean to take what kind of steps in what

to do something to the waterworks, poison it or something, and
he is on the way down there with the poison in his car.

Is that the presumption?

Mr. Kelley. We hadn't gone that far, but all right, you
can extent it.

Mr. Schwarz. All right, now, in that case you have the

traditional law enforcement tool, which is the power of arrest.

Mr. Kelley. Not under probable cause where he has not
gone down there. The hypothetical we gave was one where he had
not taken any overt acts in perpetration of this,

Mr. Schwarz. Well, if he hasn't taken any overt acts,
are you then in what you would call in imminent threat of
human life or property?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Schwarz. How so? Unless he has taken an overt: act:
to buy the poison or to get in the car with the poison, there
is not by definition any threat to life or property.

Mr. Kelley. Mr. Schwarz, I've-been around in this business.
a long time. I've-heard a number of threats which were issued,
and they thereafter materialized into actions. I don't think -|
take these threats as being empty ones, because so many times
they have been acted upon.

kill me, and it was said later on, it's not rhetoric, it's

kill me, that just means one thing.

Mr. Schwarz. But I'm not disagreeing with ‘you.

Mr. Kelley. But you are disagreéing with me. You're sayin
on the basis of experience that you cannot detect a possible
threat. That's the whole area of concern that we have here, whe
we don't lose the capability of doing something. We don't
say we should initiate ourselves. We say that we should go to
the Attorney General. We do not subscribe to the idea that
we should act independently because maybe we don't have the
judicial review, the capability of determining, but we do
think that we should report it and thereafter see what can
be done.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, have you re in the qourse of
our discussion the standard on page 5.

On page 5 you're talking about an imminent threat..

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And I hear you now as saying a possible
threat.

Mr. Kelley. An imminent possible threat.

Mr. Schwarz. An imminent possible threat. All right.

Now, would a fair standard for either action, other than
arrest, I don't know what you have in mind, but something to
prevent the person from carrying out his activities, other
than arrest, for instance, what is an example of what you have

in mind?

7. Mr. Kelley. In some fashion perhaps. |
8 Mr. Schwarz. Now, for such activity and for opening

12 || crime involving violence?

WARD & PAUL

13 Mr. Kelley. I think that this thing could be worked out
14 so that there could be an adequate basis for an evaluation.
15 Mr. Schwarz. So those words, without trying to commit
16 you entirely to them, do not seem to you to depart far from
17 || what you think would be an acceptable standard.

18 Mr. Kelley. Well, an imminent, immediate threat might

Mr. Schwarz. But on the question, let's take the opening
of an investigation into a domestic group.

Is it basically consistent with practicality to make the
test immediate threat of a serious Federal crime involving
violence?

Mr.Kelley. To open a domestic security case.

Mr. Schwarz. Yes.

Mr. Kelley. It appears to me that this is a terrorist
activity, in effect. We certainly have terrorist activities
under our jurisdiction as a threat against the United States.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, are there other circumstances where
it is justifiable to open an investigation of the domestic
group where you do not have an immediate threat of serious
federal crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. Oh, I think there are other criteria, and
they have been well defined as to what is the possible
opening, the basis for a possible opening. We haven't been
discussing that, we have been discussing particular instances,
but there are other criteria that are used, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. What would the other criteria be?

Mr. Kelley. Well, the possible statutory violations
over which we have jurisdiction are, generally speaking, the
most used of thebasis, and then you have, of course, some
intelligence investigations which should, of course, be of

short duration. If there is no showing of this into action

or a viable intent.

Mr. Schwarz. So that's what you're teens for in the
intelligence investigation?

Mr. Kelley. . By intelligence investigation, yes, you
are looking to prevent.

Mr. Schwarz. And what you are looking to prevent, and
what you're looking to find is a likelihood of action combined
with an intent to take an issue?

Mr. Kelley. And the capability.

Mr. Schwarz. And the capability.

All right. I just have two other lines, Mr. Kelley, and
I appreciate very much your time.

Mr. Kelley. That's all right.

Mr. Schwarz. Assuming a legitimate investigation has -
been started into a domestic intelligence matter, is it legiti-
mate for the FBI, in addition to obtaining information that
relates to what we've just been talking about, the likelihood
of violent action, is it also legitimate for the FBI to
collect, A, retain, B, disseminate, C, information concerning
let's say the sex life of a person on the one hand, and the
political views of a person on the other?

Mr. Kelley. I think, Mr. Schwarz, that this is just what
many of our problems and perhaps the guidelines can define
this type of thing. I think probably you will agree that

within the determination of the deviations possibly of sex

as a determination by guidelines that might be prepared later,
I think that we can certainly deliberate on this to see whether
or not this is something we should retain, and we would not
object to anything reasonable in that regard.

Mr. Schwarz. I just have one final question.

Taking the current manual and trying to understand its
applicability laid against the facts in the Martin Luther King
case, under Section 87 there is a -- permission is granted to
open investigations of the infiltration of non-subversive
groups, and the first sentence reads: "When information is
received indicating that a givers group is seeking to
systematically infiltrate and control a non-subversive group
or organization, an investigation can be opened."

Now, .I take it that is the same standard that was used
in opening the investigation of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in the 1960s, so that invéstigation could still be
open today under the FBI manual, the current FBI manual.

Mr. Kelley. We are interested in the infiltration of
clearly subversive groups into non-subversive groups inasmuch
as this is a ploy that is used many times, and having infil-
trated, they then get control, and they have a self-laundered
organization which they can use, and not, certainly, to the
benefit of the country.

Mr. Schwarz. But is the answer to my question yes, that

under that standard, the SCLC investigation could still be

opened today?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Schwarz. All right, then, just one final question.

Do you agree that special care needs to be taken not only
of the standards for initially opening an investigation of a
group, but perhaps extra care needs to be taken when the investil-
gation goes beyond the initial target group to individuals
or people who come into contact with it?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know if I agree with that entirely. If
you mean that we go into the non-subversive group, that we
then investigate peopie in that non-subversive group, not the
infiltrators, but the non, that a conduct a lengthy investigatijon
of them without any basis for doing so other than that they
are in an infiltrated group, I would likely have said -- but
off the top of my head I would say probably that's not necessary).

Mr. Schwarz. Thank you very much,

Mr. Smothers. Just a couple of very brief lines of
ingtiry, Mr. Kelley.

I think that the questions of the Chief Counsel. was
raising is one that goes further into your statement, when you
talk about the difficulty of setting out the line between

intelligence gathering and law enforcement kinds of functions..

Nevertheless, though, I think that you have made an effort,
indeed, the Bureau's organizational scheme reflects as «: ii !

to distinguish some of this has been made.

Putting aside for one moment the counterespionage
effort, and looking strictly at what we have been calling the
Domestic Intelligence, is it eee that the retention of
this function in the Bureau is critical to the Bureau's
law enforcement position?

Mr. Kelley. My personal opinion is that the Bureau does
a splendid job in this area. I feel further that the ns |
of criminal investigatory activities and experiences which
all counterintelligence people have is very helpful. It is hel}
ful not only in gathering knowledge and experience, it also
enters into this field, a person with a broad understanding
of the rights and privileges, and you don't have so much that
spy type, that cloak and dagger, that very, very secret type
of an operation.

I subscribe to the present system heartily.

Mr. Smothers. Would it be of assistance to your mission
if within the Bureau guidelines were established that
effectively limited access or controlled dissemination of
the intelligence product? In other words, if we had a
situation where the intelligence product is critical to assist
the law enforcement effort, I don't think there's any question
that there should be access to it.

Isn't our problem one of controlling the use of that
intelligence product and preventing the kind of murky crossing

of lines there with the information legitimately needed for

2 Mr. Kelley. There is always a problem when there is wide

3 dissemination, because that just numerically increases the

Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

4 possibility of misuse, abuse or slander, libel, or anything

5 of that matter, and I think that it would be well worthwhile
6 to review the dissemination rules to make them subject to

9 ¢€lose guidance in the guidelines that we're speaking of.

8 Mr. Smothers. Let me just raise one final area with you.

11 || regarding the improper actions on the COINTELPRO, and the

1g || King case in particular.

13 As we look at allegations of impropriety by your personnel}

WARD & PAUL

14 I think it would be helpful for our record here to have some
15 insight into the procedure the Bureau would normally follow.
16 What does the Bureau do when you get an allegation that
WW an agent or administrative official in the Bureau has behaved
18 improperly?
19 Is an investigation conducted internally, or is it
20 routinely referred to the Justice Department?
21 Mr. Kelley. There may be a revision in this type of
- procedure as a result of the establishment of the Council for
23 Professional Responsibility. At present it would be in the

15 How does the interplay work there between you and Justice?
16 Mr. Kelley. We do report to the Attorney General those

18 There is a possibility that the Department, having been advised
19 ‘of the situation, might take it on their own to do their own

20 investigating, and this is something that we feel is a

21 decision to be made only rather rarely, because we feel we

22 have within our own organization sufficient capability to

The San Francisco Office contacted WFO, who advised that
the area code 212 was a New York area code and not Washington,
D.C. FBI, San Francisco, telephoned the number 212-924-7586.

A male answered the phone and a request was made to speak with
ROBERT LEE LEWIS, who then came to the phone. The San Francisco
agent identified himself as an FBI agent to LEWIS and told him
that he was inquiring about the telephone call that had been
made by him to ED MONTGOMERY, a reporter in San Francisco.

LEWIS admitted making the telephone call and stated that he

did not represent himself to be an investigator for the CHURCH
Committee. He went on at some length and in a rambling manner
relating to many of his past investigative experiences, including
his contacts with EUNICE SHRIVER; a priest at Georgetown;
representatives of the Secret Service, especially Agent DON
CHACOS, and others. He again denied impersonating a government
investigator; stated that his life was an open book and that

he would have to contact representatives of the CHURCH Committee
concerning this matter. He also stated that SA DON CHACOS of
Secret Service in Washington, D.C., could vouch for him.

He was told that in all probability that an agent from the New
Yor Office would contact him for an additional interview.

He stated that would be fine and that he would request that

a telephonic appointment be made.

SA BOB TITTLE of WFO telephonically advised that
Secret Service Agent DON CHACOS had advised him that he was aware
G&.LEWIS and his activities and described him-as.an-over-
. zealous, aggressive reporter; aiso, that he had received a
letter from Senator CHURCH for some reporting that he had done.?

“a New York is requested to review enclosed communications,
and in line with Bureau instructions, intérview .ROBERT LEE
LEWIS. He should be cautioned against any further situations
which might lead someone to believe he is a government investigator.

7 There does not appear to be anything of value obtained by
LEWIS in this matter, There does not seem to be any reason to
present this case to the USA. It is believed by San Francisco
that upon completion of the interview by New York that this

case should be closed.

Information copy furnished Boston inasmuch as they
had a similar situation concérning ROBERT LEE LEWIS, 8/75.
