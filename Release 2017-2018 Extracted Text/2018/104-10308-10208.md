t, This memorandum ig for the Director's information only ard dozs
not require action.

2. An invitation by the Government of Cuba to Khrushchev to visit
that country hae been officially accepted, but as yet no definite time has
been sot. There has been speculation that Khrushchev would arrive In
Habana for the 26th of July celebrations, while a preas report, confirming
a statement of the Soviet Ambaasader in Mexice, predicts the arrival for
Aagust, Earlier reports had suggested December 1¢60 or January 1761
as possible dates.

3. His feit that a successful visit by Khrushchey te Cuba would assist
further in the establishment af a solid Soviet understanding with that country,
with distarbing overtones on the possible establishment of claser Soviet
relationships in other parts of Latin America, For this reason it le
desirable to prevent the visit or to counteract it by a show of massive
opposition by the Cuban poople. i

4 On2Zi June the Habana Station was asked for its views on pos:
plans. Jn the exchange of cables that has followed, the Station and Hea
are now in agreement that the best course of action lies in two operations.
First, a massive church manifestation or rally to be called for some other
purposs would afford the people of Cuba an obvious way to expresa their
protest, Second, the instigation of rarners that Khrushthev's life will be
in danger while in Cuba from a well-planned assassination attempt would
be propagated from other Latin American countries.

5, Because of the need of avolding action in Cuba in this crateert
would imperil Station assets, it has been determined that such assets wo
be used only aa a means of iustigating the church to hold the rally.

satisfactorily. (pienop Boza Maavlia)) lis described as enthused about the

TO 3s CAH/L
Subject: Khrushchev Visit to Cuba

1. Background. An invitation to visit Cuba has been extended
to Khrushchev by the Government of Cuba. The invitation has been

' accepted, but do definite time has been set. There has been some

speculation that Khrushchev would arrive in Havana in time for the
celebrations of the 26th of July. The press has reported that ke
will-arrive in August (a date confirmed by a statement of the Soviet
Ambassador in Mexico), Other reports say the visit will not teke
place for several months, probably in December or January. In any
event we mist plan for the possibility of the July visit.

It has been stated from several sanguine quarters that we
should "do the ssme thing to Khrushchev that the Japs did to Eisen-
hower". This is a completely unrealistic dream.

It is true that « successful Khrushchev visit to Cuba
would be the final steze in the construction of a solid Soviet
base in Cuba, with disturbing overtones for the possible construction
for more Soviet ideoligical bases in all. of Latin America. For that
reagon we are trying to do what we can to prevent the visit, or at
least to show a masgive sk opposition to it.

2. Exploitati@nPlang. On 21 dune Has sent a cable to Havana
asking for views on possibility of a major effort to force cancellation
of the vielt. A resulting series of cables shows that the station and
headquarters are now in agreement that our best hope lies in

a. A massive Church manifestation or rally, which
though called for some other purpose, would be to the people
of Cuba an obvious way to express their protest, And

b. from outside Cuba, instigating of rumors that
Khrushchev's life will be in danger fe from a well-planned
assassination attempt.

3. Mr. Helms has tceld k us that he wants CIA to undertake no
action that will imperil Station escets. This injunction was placed
on us while we were exchanging cables with Havana, The result is that
station aesets are actively instigatirg the church to hole the rally.
A BAREESSE cable from Headquarters hee instructed the station to
continue this course of action as long as there is "safety in numbers”,
i.e., as long as it is a church action rather that an AMPALM one.

4. The latest cable fron the field (IN 18883) Coports that
that plans are going satisfactorily. EBienop Boze Masvi is HX
ga "enthused" about the idea, With(Jose Lavasti ae pS prominent
lay leader, he is now visiting Camaqtey to solici: @ support of
the local =: Bishop. jose Lavastidgy~e promient lay leader, is
in Santiago to seek thevhelp k of the Santéago Bishop, Tentative
plans call for a congress or rally on Assumption Day, 15 July.

The station has asked that the entire effort at least
-begin within Cuba, without ouside support from FRD or WRUL.

5. Hemisphere Plans. A cable has gone out to ELAM) (in (o-"

sane “a@ixtremxterx technique through three Cubans living in Miami
who are constant contact with Cuba.

Speculation on the assassinationsttempts will be surfaced
on the WRUL progrem, in AMPACA'S paper, etc.
