SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE she” Ri

Diredtor Soc'y

On March 27, 1975, Mr. Rocbrick Hills, Associate Counsel
to the President, came io my office and advised that he is preparing
to discuss with Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Committee,
several questions concerning the procedures that will be followed by
the Senate Select Committee in asking Tor testimony and documents from
the Executive Branch. He said the Commitée plans to publish rules
concerning their ‘procedures today or tomorrow and therefore his
discussions must be conducted with them prompily.

Mr. Hills said that-it is proposed that the Executive Branch
agencies provide counsel to represent them before the Senate Committee
when Government employees or former employees are called to testify.

He said that CIA has agreed to start that procedure and he inquired

if the FBI would agree to have counsel present during interviews or ~ 6
testimony of witnesses from the FBI. He said the White House is con- =~
cerned that if the suggestion is made by a representative of the White

House it could appear that the White House is attempting to interfere with
the Committee proceedings by intimidating witnesses and having a repeat
expérience similar to that which occurred when former Counsel to the
President John Dean insisted upon sitting in with employees during inter-
views with the FBI.

I told Mr. Hills that I saw an important difference between

[the efforts made by the former Counsel to the President and the effort

that would be made by counsel appearing before the Senate Committee.
The distinction is that in the former case the effort was intended to

intimidate witnesses in o: f jo conceal criminal activity and in the present

® e
Memorandum to Mr. Adams SECRE. Fr

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

case the effort would be made to protect legitimate, but sensitive
operations which are currently in being. I suggested to Mr. Hills

that the Executive has the right to negotiate with the Senate Committee
an arrangement whereby a representative of the executive dgency
would be present not to stifle testimony, but to suggest that testimony
be given in Executive Session or be limited only to the Senators them-
selves in order to protect information of such sensitive nature as to
require special treatment. I told Mr. Hills that it may well be that
the representative of the agency appearing with a witness should be an
individual with specific expertise in the subject matter involved in the
testimony rather than a legal counsel. Mr. Hills agreed that such
expertise would be essential. Therefore, I advised him that we would
support efforts to have counsel present during the interview or testimony
of FBI employees or former employees.

——_ __——

Mr. Hills' second point was executive privilege. He said
that he has researched the available references to executive privilege
at the White House and found that all relate to material prepared as
defensive measures and there is little in the way of positive statements
of principles of law concerning executive privilege. It is the feeling of
the President's Counsel, Mr. Buchen, that the White House must develop
a statement of principles to be applied by the President when it becomes
mecessary to claim executive privilege in the face of a demand for
jtestimony or documents by the Senate Committee which the President
decides should not be complied with. Mr Hill s said that the President's
counsel believes that it would be ah improper course for the President
to wait until a crisis arises before this matter is reviewed. I told
Mr. Hills that I thought it would be more destructive to the presidency
if the President were to claim executive privilege over a matter which
could not be justified under law. Mr. Hills said that was the exact
econcemmof Mr. Buchen and that they wanted to avoid at all cost having
the President claim executive privilege over matters that would merely
embarrass an agency and didut go to the heart of the agency's
responsibilities or to the independence of the presidency itself.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams ee
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc. SECRET

Mr. Hills said that he has been discussing with the publisher
of the "Washington Post, ' the publisher of the "New York Times, "
Daniel Schorr, and others in the news media the question of why the
press has been so critical of the claims of executive privilege within
the recent past, and it became clear as a result of his discussion that
their concern is that the claim has been misused. He said his efforts
were to convince the members of the press that a responsible claim of
executive privilege should be recognized by the press and given reasonable
support.

Mr. Hills said that in an effort to develop some general

principles by which the President could clearly indicate that any claim
of executive privilege that might become necessary is reasonable, they

i ranging for conferences with the Attorney General, responsible
law professors who are experts in the area of executive privilege, and
others who might be able to help Mr. Buchen prepare a paper for the
President stating the general guidelines under which the President will
claim executive privilege. In order to understand the areas of concern
to the various agencies that might result in a request for the President to
claim executive privilege, Mr. Hills said that the President's counsel
has requested that the agencies furnish them a summary of such critical
areas. He said that he had been advised by Larry Silberman that he should
approach the Bureau carefully because it would be most difficult to obtain
such information from the FBI. Mr. Hills said that he did not fully under-
stand the relationship of the Director with the Attorney General and the
Deputy Attorney General but that he wanted to request that the Bureau
consider briefing the President's Counsel.

Itold Mr. Hills that the Bureau had no difficulty with the
Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General when it was necessary to
brief them concerning sensitive matters but that we operated as much as
possible on the "need=to-know" principle and that should we receive
requests from any source outside the FBI we would be reluctant to
furnish sensitive information unless there were in fact reasons for
the inquirer to have a need to know. I told him that in regard to the
request from the President's Ceunsel, I was confident that the Bureau
would be willing to provide representatives and a briefing on sensitive
matters that could become subject to a claim of executive privilege

Memorandum to Mr. Adams SEGRET .

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

because there would be an important need to know on the part of the
President's Counsel in developing his guidelines for the President to
use in considering requests for executive privilege.

Iasked Mr. Hills how urgent his request was and he replied
that on Tuesday, April 1, 1975, he is scheduled to have a formal conference
with Bill Miller and Frederick Schwartz, Counsel for the Senate Select
Committee, and he expects that meeting to concern the problem of Executive
privilege. Therefore, they would like to have the briefing as soon as
possible in order for the study concerning executive privilege to be under
way on the weekend of March 29-30, 1975. Ltold Mr. Hills that we would
recontact him as soon as possible to advise as to the arrangements that
could be made for such a briefing.

Iadvised Mr. Adams of the request from the White House
Counsel and he agreed that the Bureau should arrange to provide a
briefing to the White House Counsel. I called Mr. Wannall and advised
him of the request and of Mr. Adams' suggestion that he and Mr. Wannall
represent the Bureau in the briefing and that the briefing could be held on
Friday, March 28, 1975. Mr. Wannall was requested to prepare a
summary memorandum for use by himself and Mr. Adams describing the
areas of concern which the Bureau might anticipate would require a
request of the President to exercise a claim of executive privilege.
Mr. Wannall agreed to do so at once.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That depending upon the circumstances and on a case-by-

case basis the Bureau designate a representative to appear with any FBI
employee or former employee called for interview or testimony by the

Senate Select Committee.

ADDENDUM: J, B, ADAMS 3/31/75 JBA:ams

On 3/28/75 Mr. Wannall and I met with Mr. Buchen and Mr. Hills
at the White House. The purpose of the meeting was to review the role of
The White House in coordinating the responses of the various intelligence
agencies to the Senate Committ ee to insure that there was uniformity in
complying with Committee requests in that any restrictions on the furnishing
of information were uniform.

It was determined that there is a unanimity of opinion that access
to raw files would not be granted Committee members or staff as a matter
of practice, although it is not inconceivable that some particular horrendous
event might arise which is of such significance that access to the files on
that matter might be granted to the Committee Chairman or a select number
of Senators.

We discussed items which we felt were particularly sensitive such
as identities of informants, sources and cooperative citizens as well as
information received from foreign sources. The sensitivity of specific
details on confidential expenditures was pointed out although we had no
objection to discussing or making available the gross figures.

We discussed the various means of electronic exploitation in the ¢s>
foreign intelligence field including the(Orkid progragijand similar programs,
electronic wiretaps, microphones, (Telex, and electronic penetration of

) communications equipment.) We pointed out that there were varying degrees
of sensitivity involved and each type of surveillance would have to be individually
considered as to the degree of disclosure which could be made to the Committee.

We briefly discussed activities which had previously taken place

yet which might be subject of current interest because of newspaper publicity

and allegations, We were reminded on more than one occasion that it was

absolutely imperative that the White House not be surprised without being

forewarned of any earthshaking incidents which might come to light. In this

context, we mentioned the(Anagram progrant) the various mail and pouch (S)
| intercepts, the Karot and related cases, surreptitious entries in connection

with CP, Klan and such investigations.

Cointelpro was mentioned as well as a
\\ Mr. Buchen inquired about exploitation of unavailable Government

records and we mentioned Bureau Source 4, Social Security records, as an

example.

AW 55016 DocId:32989604 Page 13



Mr. Hills again asked if there were any other items which we
felt should be brought up which might be sensitive because of the embarrassing
nature of them and we pointed out that we felt we had covered the more
significant items although there were of course various allegations from time
to time which have been addressed, such as the Anna Chanault surveillance
and other allegations raised by former Assistant to the Director Sullivan.
He suggested that if after reflection we think of any other matters which should
be mentioned to have no hesitancy in bringing it to their attention.

Finally, we discussed the first request from Senator Church dated
March 19, 1975, for information on legal authority, jurisdictional agreements,
organization, policies and procedures, and studies and reports. We were
pretty much in agreement on how to handle that request and Mr. Wannall will
submit a separate memorandum in that regard.

Re: Senstudy 75

During the period of these investigations it was
determined that Embassy of Israel officials recruited U. 8.
scientists for employment in Israel, and extensive liaison was
established with individuals within U. S. scientific, political,
academic and industrial communities. As an example, Hermoni
developed close contact with Dr, Zalman Mordecai Shapiro, Director
of Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation, Apollo,
Pennsylvania, a firm which processes uranium 235 for nuclear
reactors. (S$

During this period it was also determined that the
IIS was attempting to penetrate the United Nations (UN) and
Arab diplomatic establishments in New York City, An informant
of the New York Office, who previously engaged in intelligence
activities in the Middle East for the Israelis between 1955 and
1960 while working at the UN, was recontacted by Israeli intel-
ligence in August, 1968, while visiting Israel. This informant
had access at the UN to extremely sensitive information from the
office of the Secretary General, Israeli intellisence had
directed him to obtain and furnish, through a mail drop in
Belgium, interoffice communications between the Secretary General
of the UN and his undersecretaries, and information regarding
the Hiddle East, particularly relating to Arab matters, (Ss)

In May, 1968, another informant of the New York Office,
who previously resided in the Middle East and was active in the
Egyptian intelligence service, addressed a personal letter to
General Dayan of Israel in which he expressed his opinion the
Israelis should force the Egyptians to surrender and sign a peace
treaty. Informant was subsequently contacted in New York City by
an Israeli intelligence agent who furnished his name as "Michael"
who showed informant a copy of his letter to Dayan, "Michael"
subsequently "recruited" informant and furnished him a mail drop

SAL. F. Schwartz.

Angleton recently testified under oath before three
Senators and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC).
He appeared without counsel. During his testimony, Angleton
vas asked numerous questions concerning his knowledge of
Israeli capabilities to conduet intelligence collection in the
United States, Among the questions asked Angleton were questions
bearing on Israeli efforts to gather nuclear information in
the United States. Angleton indicated that the SSC apparently
is aware of Angleton's past close relationship with the Israelis,
and Angleton feels that the questions directed to him by the
" $8C may be related to information provided to the Committee by
correspondent Tad Szule who, according to Angleton, is writing
an article concerning Angleton's relationship with the Israelis
for Penthouse Magazine. Angleton understands that Szule has
either testified or has been interviewed by the SSC.

Angleton stated that he avoided any direct answers
on the above questions by stating that any knowledge he might
have would be secondhand and Eragmentary He advised the SSC
that such questions might more properly be directed to the FBI.
When asked who in the Bureau might be knowledgeable in this

area, Angleton replied that he did not know but that he believed
the current senior Bureau official concerned with operational
matters to be Deputy Associate Director James B, Adams.

In addition, Angleton advised that certain questions
he was asked dealt with alleged Soviet attempts to infiltrate
the CIA and other agencies. Again, Angleton avoided a direct

- answer and indicated that the FBI would be the appropriate
agency to direct such questions to, Finally, Angleton commented
that in the event the Bureau thought it desirable he would be
happy to personally brief the Director or other appropriate
Bureau official concerning his.testimony. He commented that
he has not been asked to, nor has he offered to, brief William
Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, concerning his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS +

1. We are checking for any available information
in files concerning Israeli intelligence collection capabilities
in the United States, Results will be summarized in separate
memorandum, (> i

2. It is not believed appropriate to request

Angleton to brief the Director or other Bureau official
concerning his testimony, particularly since Angleton has
not seen fit to brief his former superiors at CIA. A request
by the Bureau for a briefing by Angleton might be misconstrued
if it were to tome to the attention of Colby or other CIA
officials,

from both the Department and the FBI. Appendix C III, page “four, 4
of the 5/14/75 letter concerned itself with the 0 & C files of the AY
FBI, Specifically, Question 21 asked for an itemized description

of the contents of each 0 & C folder. Question 22 requested all
memoranda and other materials contained in the 0 & C files pertainigg
to internal security, intelligence collection and/or counterintelL

statements was furnished AG Levi. Following receipt of these,
the AG, accompanied by the then Associate Deputy AG James
Wilderotter, visited the Bureau and personally reviewed a

number of files from which the summary statements were. developed.
It was based on this review that the AG made his statement before
the House Judiciary Committee on 2/27/75.

In order to comply with the requests from the SSC dated
5/14/75 relating to the 0 & C files, it is suggested we permit
Senator Church and Senator John Tower, Minority Chairman of the
SSC, be. allowed to review the 164 summary statements prepared
by the Inspection Division without any deletions or. excisions.
We believe this effort would demonstrate a willingness on the
part of the Bureau to be forthcoming and would allow the Committee
in the persons of Church and Tower to satisfy themselves that
the AG's statement of 2/27/75 correctly represented the contents
of the 0 & C files, If after this review Senators Church and
Tower feel they would personally like to review a file or files
from which the summary statements were prepared, we would be in

ay a Aj a position to excise from the file or files any information which
ay et | might reveal highly sensitive investigative techniques: or the

Po mae oy | investigets of sources, either of which could jeopardize FBI ongoing

. It is recognized, of course, that the manner in which
we respond to the SSC in this or any other requests is a decision
that the AG must make.

ACTION: That Deputy Associate Director Adams personally discuss
this matter with the AG as to how the AG desires the Bureau
respond to the 5/14/75 request regarding the contents of the

As you lnow, the decision of the Supreme Court on March 10, i
1969, in Willie Israel Alderman, et al. v. United States expanded
“the concept of Standing with respect to electronic surveillance and
held that an individual has standing not only with respect to his om
overheard conversations but also with respect to*‘overhearings on :
premises in which he has a proprietary interest, even though he was ‘
not present at the time of the conversations. Because of this decision, y
it will be necessary in future requests for electronic surveillance
information to ascertain whether or not there was coverage on premises
in which the subject had a proprietary interest. Accordingly, it is
requested that you advise as hie each of the individuals on the atbached \
List: : ,

{a} Whether the named individual appears to be present ab,
or a participant in, conversations overheard in any electronic surveillance
by your agency. |

(b) Whether an electronic surveillance was conducted on any |
premises of which the named individual was the omer, lessee or licensee.

(c) If the individual or the premises of which the individual
was ower, lessee or licensee was the subject of an electronic surveillance,
did the surveillance consist of wiretapping or an electronic eavesdropping
device. ‘

(6) If the latter, please advise us of the method of_entry| 4

In the attached memorandum from Fred M. wa

Bureau to setup indices of individuals who may have been covered wr
by electronic devices and who may be under consideration ° hh <<

The Director has instructed that Vinson be seta" {ope t
such an indices is already in operation and that if he feeis the if
need to.consult with any Bureau officials, Mr. DeLoach has been
designated to handle the contact. The Director also inquired as 7
to whether the statements in Vinson's letter to the effect that a i
gambling case in Miami had been closed ‘because of prior bee tekar Sela

coverage were correct. aa
a ¢ GE

In his letter, Vinson is apparently referring to the
gambling case which we developed on\Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal in
the Miami area. We did havé confidential coverage on Rosenthal
and Attorney General Katzenbach approved“ this coverage on our memo of
April Li2,_1965. Rosenthal was not arrested in the Miami case

With reference to other statements made in Vinson's
letter, we have made available to the Department, whevever requested,
pertinent logs of our frmer confidential coverage. Cur indices
are adequate to handle any further contact by the Department in
this regard. We are so advising Vinson in the attached letter

In recent months the Department has bee confronted with serious
. problems concerning the prospective or continued wrosecution of individuals
who have been the, subject_of. prio®electronic surveillance. These problems
havé Sémetimes arisen comparatively late in the investigative or prosecutive’
process. For example, we recently were forced to close an important /
/ investigation involving major gambling figures in Miami because we were;
/ advised that the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction was tainted. In *
xhec cases the problem arose after indictment (United States-v. Davis,
i. Bufile 49-16547; United States v.’ John Drew) or in thé appellate stage aiter

(e trial (United States’'v. Black; United States v. Koiod),
Bare ews 2 AL

In view of these experiences, it appears necessary and desirable.
that the Department have full knowledge of the extent of any device probler
at as early a stage of preparation for prosecution as possible in order to
hdetermine whether a particular case may or may not be tainted or what

. esponses will be necessary with respect to a motion under Rule 16 to

(A) INDEX SYSTEMS -- In an important case with great public
interest, an individual was not identified because of the failure of
an office to properly index a nickname.

Recent court decisions have resulted in the public
disclosure of electronic surveillance logs and related material
which heretofore were confidential. The information in these
surveillance matters is being afforded close scrutiny by the news
media, the general public, Federal, state, and local officials;
therefore, the importance of proper indexing has become
increasingly significant.

Each Special Agent in Charge will be held strictly
respdorsible for insuring that aii names, nicknames, and aliases
appearing in electronic surveillance logs and related material

’ are properly indexed in accordance with the instructions set forth
in Part Il, Section 3, page 4, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

“the concept of standing with réspéct to electronic supveillence and
7 held that an individual has standing not only with respect to his owm
overheard conversations but also with respect to‘overhearings or
premises in which he has a proprietary interest, even though he ..'.s
hot present at the time of the conversations. Because of this decision,

SUBJECT: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REQUESTS.
FOR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE
CHECKS (62-318)

As you are aware, Department is submitting by letter to
Bureau names of individuals presently being prosecuted or being
considered for prosecution in all types of cases with request they
be advised if any of these individuals have been involved in any
electronic surveillances., Indications are that there will be
thousands of such requests received. These names are checked
through special indices maintained in Special Investigative Division
(SID) and Domestic Intelligence Division (DID), and Department is
advised by letter of results. SID is co-ordinating program, but ~
some correspondence will be prepared by DID and General Investigative”
Fr Division if substantive cases supervised by them involved. If any -~
record is located, Field Office where surveillance occurred is
requested to furnish pertinent logs which are subsequently trans-
mitted to Department.

: With representatives of SID, where majority of correspond-
| ence will be handied, we have worked out mechanics of processing

, * and. filing record material. Purpose of this memorandum is to set
forth these details, i

A control file has been opened entitled, "Department of
Justice Requests for Electronic Surveillance Checks" (62-318), ALL

it requests from Department will be filed in this file. Outgoing

| 3 answers to Department will also be filed in this file unless subject

of communication is subject of a Bureau investigation in which case

original will be filed in substantive file and copy in control file.

On any communications from Field relating to substantive file, copy

will also be placed in control file. Supervisors preparing corre-
spondence should prepare extra copy specifically’ designed for
control file when correspondence relates to substantive case.

As set forth above, if subject of communication is subject
iy of a Bureau investigation communication will be filed in case file
rt with copy in control file, and no indexing will be necessary. Tf He
subject of communication is not subject of Bureau case, but voice was i
| recorded incidental to electronic-surveillance in one of our cases

and we are furnishing Department positive information, communication
ee | will be filed in control file and name.of subject will be indexed.

; We will not index names of individuals on which no record is located
13 similar to procedure followed in handling Bureau's name check program.

Communications relating to these negative checks will be filed in
control file.

: In order to appropriately cover necessary files, uniformity
eae of caption of communications is most desirable. On outgoing commu-
! , «nications to Field and Department, "Electronic Surveillance Check"

as should be in caption to facilitate classifying material. If Bureau
case is involved, subject of case should also be part of caption
with sufficient copies to cover both’case file and control file.

)
PURPOSE:

The Special Investigative Division and the Domestic
Intelligence Division are maintaining separate special indices of
individuals monitored or mentioned through microphone or telephone
surveillances, Those of the Special Investigative Division contain
names obtained through coverage of criminal matters. Those of the
Domestic Intelligence Division contain names obtained through
coverage of internal security matters, The purpose of this memo-

randum is to recommend that these two special indices be consolidate

and operated py tne Files and Communications Division.
BACKGROUND: mint

In accordance with the Director's instructions, special
indices were established in October, 1966, because of the

Department's insistence that the Bureau provide a rapid determin-
ation as to whether any given person subject to prosecution was

‘overheard, present, or referred to in the course of a conversation
covered py electronic devices. Based on available information at
‘that time from the Department that there would be selective cases

to be reviewed, it was determined to be most logical that two
Separate indices be established, one to cover criminal matters and
the other security matters. Subsequently, the Solicitor General
publicly disclosed that an extensive review would be made on past ©
and pending cases to determine if evidence had been used from
electronic devices and the Department requests that all names be
searched through both the criminal and security files. This ©
completely changed all aspects of the operation of these indices
and the amount of work involved, particularly when.the Department
began submitting not-only names of persons subject to prosecution
but names of attorneys’ involye and associates. qfithe-subjects.

CURRENT STATUS:

There are approximately 60,000 cards of the special
indices in the Special Investigative Divisién and approximately

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: -SPECIAL INDICES OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES
66-5815

200,000 cards of the special indices in the oe Intelligence
Division. Furthermore, because of the telephone surveillances
currently in operation in the security field, approximately 300
new cards are being received weekly in td Domestic Intelligence
Division. -

I. ul
CURRENT OPERATION OF SPECIAL INDICES:

Since the special indices were established in
October, 1966, the Department has submitted approximately 1,000
names for searching. Each name is searched through both of these
special indices. There is attached a sample of the form being
used requesting searches and a copy of three cards from the
special indices.

The Department has “indicated that in the immediate
future it contemplates asking the Bureau to check as many as
25,000 names through the special indices. Without a doubt, ail
future cases involving prosecution will require search of these
indices,

OBSERVATIONS:

The position adopted by the Department in these matters
makes it impossible for us to maintain these indices separately
‘as originally established. The checking of these indices would
have imposed no great burden on either the Domestic Intelligence
: Division or the Special Investigative Division had the Department
followed a lJogical and reasonable course in the submission of
names of persons to be checked in connection with a particular
criminal or security prosecution, But as matters now stand,
these separate indices should be*consolidated to avoid duplication
of effort in checking the same names through each as we now must
do to comply with the Department's requests. Both Divisions are
in agreement on this point.

-. Consolidation of the indices into one raises the
question of where it should be maintained. We believe the |
consolidated indices should be maintained by the Files. and
Communications Division. There is no reason for it to.be main~

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: SPECIAL INDICES OF ELECTRONIC SURVELLLANCES
66-5815

“RECOMMENDATION :

It is recommended that the special indices under
discussion of -the Domestic Intelligence Division and the
Special Investigative Division be turned over to the Files
and Communications Division and be maintained and searched
by that Division.

aDENOU W.S.TAVEL FILES & COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION 1-16-67

Iam opposed to the’maintenance of this index being shifted to the Files
and Communications Division. It would not save personnel, since this division
is expending every effort to keep up with the greatly increased volume of other
types of name checks and could not absorb an additional 25, 000 or more with
existing personnel, This index has no relation tc the Bureau's master index,
and must be maintained separately since the cards contain little or no identifying

ADDENDUM: Continued a

data, For this reason, each check where possible identity is established
necessitates correspondence with the field, which must be handled by the
substantive supervisor. Since the cards disclose names of all persons
mentioned in technical surveillance logs, it would appear essential to limit
the number of employees having access, to keep to a minimum those who
might be subpoenaed to testify concerning these matters. We do not’have
room or personnel in our special file room to operate such an index, and
since this room is in the Identification Building, moving it there would only
‘serve to further remove itfrom the supervisors handling it, who now have
immediate access. It is similar to other specialized indices now maintained
‘ by substantive divisions, such as the Fugitive Index, Security Index, index of
brary cards mamunist material, ete., which serve 2 specific purpose

and arc most efficiently operated by the divisions using them. “

PH ese EEE ' The instructions issued to the United States Attorneys by the
~“ Acting Attor ney Gen jl are as follows:

aoe "You will recall that in May 1966 the Department advised the
Supreme Céurt of facts relating to the case of Black v. United States,
October Term, 1965, No. 1029. Its memorandum in that case stated
in pertinent part:

‘Notwithstanding the Department of Justice's conclusion

that the monitoring of conversations between petitioner and

his attorney had no effect upon his conviction or the fairness
of his trial, we have no doubt that in the circumstances
outlined above petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination.
We also recognize that petitioner has standing to raise, ina
district court, the question whether other conversations (i.e.,
conversati ions not involving an attorney-client relationship)

which were e overheard as a result of the listening device

installed in his suite furnished any leads or evidence

in his case. At an appropriate Hearing, the government
* proposes to submit all of the facts upon which a full

judicial determination can be made.'

"This Department must never procecd with any investigation or
case which includes evidence iliegaily obtained or the iruits of that
evidence. No investigation or case of that character shall go forward
until such evidence and all of its fruits have been purged and we are in
a position to assure ourselves and the court that there is no taint or
unfairness. We must, also, scrupulously avoid any situation in which

"an intrusion into a confidential relationship would deny a fair hearing
to a defendant or person under investigation.

"For this reason we are in the process of requesting each
investigative agency concerned to review its files in order to determine
whether there has been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching
a particular case or matter. We are making a similar review of cases
and matters pending in the Department. You will be informed im-
mediately whenever a case or matter in your office is found to fall
in this category. - j

“Many matters are referred directly to your offices by the
investigating agencies. Special attention must he given to these. But,
it is imperative that you and your assistants make every effort to
ascertain whether any cases, now pending or hereafter received, present
the problem of wiretapping or electronic surveillance. No single means

of checking is infallible but you should keep in mind that the same
person or matter may have been investigated by several Federal or

State agencies and the information supplied to you may in fact come
from more than one source. You should be particularly attentive
to those cases which involve, directly or indirectly, hard core elements
of organized crime.

HW 55016 Docla: 32989604 Page 103



"Jt is, of course, the very rare case--one out of thousands--
in which you will encounter ‘the problem to which this memorandum is
addressed. The problem will arise in cages in which some investigation
was conducted prior to July, 1965. Present practice, . adopted in July
1965 in confirmity with the policies declared by President Johnson on

June 30, 1965.for the entire Federal establishment, prohibits the
installation of listening devices in private areas (as well as the
interception of telephone and other wire communications) in all
instances other than those involving the collection of intelligence
affecting the national security. The specific authorization of the
Attorney General must be obiuined in each instance when this
exception is invoked. Intelligence data so collected will not be
available for investigative or litigativve. purposes.

"Tf you have any reason whatever to believe that there has
‘been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching a particular case,
you should immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant
Attorney General, Internal Security Division, so that further inquiry
_ may, be pursued by the Department."



NW 55016 Docta: 132989604 Page 105

immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant ee General,
Internal Security Division.

With reference to this subject matter the Bureau is currently
handling numerous requests from-the Department to check the names ‘of
various subjects against the special indices set up at the Bureau on all
persons who have been subject of any FBI electronic surveillance. It
is expected that any cases questioned by the United States Attorneys
and referred to Mr. Yeagley will be given the same ace on the
request of the Department.

Although instructions to the United States pean by the
Acting Attorney General do not specifically requi
various investigative agencies at the field level s quite likely that
some of our field offices will receive inquiries from the United States
Attorneys. In case such inquiries are received by field offices requesting
that information obtained from electronic surveillances be furnished,’ the
Bureau should be immediately advised of the request and all pertinent
details. No response should be made to the United States Attorneys in

_ Such instances without prior Bureau authorization. This procedure is

nécessary in view of the possibility that the subject of a case may have
been in some way covered by an electronic surveillance in a field office
not, participating in investigation of the prosecutive case in question.

MICROPHONE. AND.. TELEPHONE, SURVEILLANCES.

i - In connection with problems arising out of past
electronic surveillance coverage of individuals now under
prosecution, or against whom prosecution is being contem—
plated, the Department, as you know, made a general request
that we establish an “early warning system" in the form of
‘an, index or other administrative device to enable a check

| to be made to determine if we have so monitored the voices
of such individuals. The Department was advised that we
had such a system in operation,

' In line with the Department's requirements, this F
,index, which is now in operation, is made up of names of
‘individuals whose voices were monitored by microphone
‘surveillances, technical surveillances, or other similar
[ electronic listening devices since January, 1960.

As you know, the Department has recently forwarded
a list of 151 names of individuals currently of prosecutive
interest in the Tax Division, with a request that these names.~
be checked through our index to determine if they were the
subjects of direct electronic surveillance coverage; whether
,{an individual in question appears on any records, logs, notes,
+|memoranda, et cetera, either as a participant in conversations
overheard, or as a person mentioned or discussed. 7

This new and’ belated category introduced by the Tax

}rin order that references in this category can be added to the
‘jnames already included in the index so as to answer any future
{iinguiries from the Tax Division. It should be noted that the
Criminal Division has never required any information concerning
the names of persons wntioned in microphone logs and has always
satisfied themselves with information concerning those whose con-
versations were actually recorded, .This new request. anpoars-to

Re: Microphone and Telephone Surveillances

wp cr Tastee ote

\ be an additional example of the Tax Division going far ‘beyond

what is required by the courts or even by another division of
the Department. . Nevertheless, in order to answer any inquiries

., along this line with the dispatch desired, it will be necessary

[ito include in our index the names of persons mentioned in~
microphone logs.

Attached is a communication to the field divisions

\\involved, alerting those offices to this additional requirement
{fon the part of the Tax Division and instructing those offices

to prepare index cards on individuals who are mentioned in
\noni torea conversations,
| The field is being instructed to use a certain amount
of common sense in recording names in this category inasmuch as
there are literally thousands of instances in which a subject
covered engages in completely inconsequential conversations in
which he may mention the name ofa third party. Examples of
this would be instructions to a maid or servant to get in
touch with a particular merchant or serviceman to handle menial
errands such as handling dry cleaning, getting a car washed and
like situations. Where a name is mentioned in this way, no
purpose is served by including it in this index. We are, of
course, following the Director's instructions in connection .4
with furnishing everything of possible pertinence to the
Department and allowing Department personnel, not FBI personnel,
determine if it is relevant.

ACTION : aan

Attached for your approval is an airtel to offices
involved in the compilation of this index, instructing that
cards also be prepared on all individuals who are mentioned
or discussed in monitored conversations, except those in the
completely inconsequential category cited above, in addition
to names of individuals already being included as those whose
voices have been monitored.

adviccd tnat the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction was tainted: In ’
{ ‘ other cases the problem arose after indictment (United States v. Davis,
a United States v. John Drew) or in the appellate stage ater
é trial (Jnited States v. Black; United States v. Kolod). f
- Raed earieaity ¢ ¥. ft
7 In view of these experiences, it appears necessary and desirable
that the Department have ‘full knowledge of the extent of any device probler
at as early a stage of preparation for prosecution as possible in order to
determine whether a particular case may or may not be tainted or what
esponses will be necessary with respect to a motion under Rule 16 to
roduce statements. j

$

Accordingly, I feel it is imperative for us to establish between
the. Bureau and the Department (and perhaps United States Attorneys in \
cases of direct referral) some sort of "early bslcdons ade system, This may
require the Bureau to set up and maintain appropriatdtindices with Hespect \

to electronic. SUEVERTSnCE and The ina materials derived therefrom:

L have discussed this suggestion With the Attérney General and ine>
Deputy Attorney General. Both feel that the establishment of such ingted.
is necessary. They have suggested that I discuss the details of their \
tablishment with representatives of the Bureau, I should thereforé~ \

This morning a meeting was held in this office between “).a%".
representatives of the National Security Agency (NSA) and representative
of this Section, The NSA representatives were Miss Blanco Stevens,
and Messrs, . Hotchkiss Young, Richard Lee, Stanley O'Shinsky and ,,.%
Thomas Pacl, Jr. Section representatives were Agents R. D. Cotter,
R. A. Mullins, V. H. Nasca and W. R, Wannall, The discussion centered
about the means by which NSA could be most helpful to the FBI in
processing some 20,090 messages received each month tin NSA coverage
of Cuban matters. The messages relate to commercial and personal
cummunications between persons in Cuba and in the United States. (s)

Mr, Young, who heads the division in which this material
is handled at NSA, pointed out inat the entire material cannot be
completely processed because of personnel restrictions and
most desirous of furnishing to the FBI material which would be most
helpful to our. operations, : After considerable discussion, it was
decided that, of the raw traffic now available,the material which

firms in’ the_U.S. which are doing business with individuals in Cuba
and the Cuban,Government, For the most part these would be légitimate
commercial transactions, however, Mr, O'Shinsky had a few items, which
by their very nature, appear suspicious--such as a $3,000 payment to
a radio’ firm with no indication as to the reason for such a large
payment, It is felt that by receiving periodic studies of such
commercial transactions we will be in a position to determine if,

by repéated-action, there might be some intelligence interests in a
particular firm in the U.S. which, of course, would be of great
interest to us. (5) id

With regard to personal messages, we feel that those
relating to individuals traveling between Cuba and the U.S, would be
the most significant . We are presemtly receiving a considerable
amount of information from communications intelligence sources
relating to persons going to.Cuba but‘a very insignificant amount
of material relating to persons going in the other direction. We
brought up our interest in this area and Mr, Lee, under whose
responsibility this primarily falls, agreed to undertake a survey
over the next few weeks and give us the results of the survey so we
can determine specificall pe ight be available in this general azea.

Memorandum to Mr, Sullivan
RE: bess ceameeeeeeeeiae INTELLIGENCE - vA) (6)

: Mr, Young pointed out that all of the some 20,000 messages

! are scanned and items which, on the surface, have some intelligence
significance are processed, We, of course, expressed an interest in
continuing to receive this type of material. Gs)

For the purpose of extracting from the raw traffic other
items which might Be of interest to the FBI but which do not appear
to be from the context of the message, we will furnish to NSA a
list of persons in whom we have an investigative or an intelligence
interest, - When the names of any individuals appearing on this list
come up in the messages, those items will be given us. For the’
purpose of maintaining this list, the NSA representatives will
dévise a 5 x 8 card on which we can indicate the name of an individual
in whom we are interested together with any identifying data we desire
to include. As soon as the format of the card has been devised, it
will be submitted for our approval, Mr. Young assured that, if we
provided name cf individual who was of vital interest to us and we
did not want data ane)" him disseminated to any other agencies,

NSA could arrange this.

It is felt that the meeting this morning was quite
beneficial to the FBI, This is a source of information which has not
yet being tapped and NSA is most anxious to handle hie source ina
Manner which is to our best benefit. *(S)
