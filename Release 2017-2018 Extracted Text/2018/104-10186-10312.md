The Cuban

foreigr intelligence service, the General Directorate of

Intelligence (Direccion General de Inteligencia - DGI), in dis-

charging its function of protecting Cuban interests and security

and promosing the pollgass of the Cuban Government, employs agents

of many nationalities.

Although its activities extend to Europo

and Afrloa, its principal agent strength is in Latin America.

Agents have ir general two types of assignments:

collection of

local government and the local situation,

promotion of revclutionary activity, including guerrilla variare.

abrond ars therefore divided into two basic cate-

gories according to luiction:

intelligence agents charged

collection of erformation

and penetration of local governments and

organizations, who are truly clandestine, 1.e.,

are not known in

ecuntries as Cuban agents; and

guerrilla warfare and

charged with directing and supporting revolution

ary activities,

who are often known as Cuban agents to the local

Communist and leftist groups with which they work.

the Cuban internal security service, the

Department of State Security (Departamento de Seguridad del

One criterion for recruitment is that the agent shall

not have a wide circle of acquaintance.

1ng.

and never. enter any bol official establishment or the case

officer's home.

A foredgn agent candidate arriving in Cube is first debriefed by

the case officer on his background and qualifications,

to that time the DGI has only advance notice of his selection and

knows little about him.

The interview is recorded, but without

the trainee's knowledge.

On one occasion in early 1964 a case

officer arranged to meet a new trainee in a Havana restaurant for

the preliminary interter.

The case officer provided himself with

a pocket tape recorder, which he tested in advance and found was

in good order.

When he started to record the interview, however,

he discovered that he had cither forgotten to adjust the mechan-

Ism after he had tested it, cr he pushed the playback instead of

the record button: the restaurart was suddenly electrified by a

voice saying:

"Testing, one, two, three: testing, one, two,

three."

The Interview

was hastily concluded and

was rescheduled

the next day in the safchouse where the agent, a Guatemalan,

waS

lodged; in this case, of course,

the agent was aware that it was

being recorded.

The

results of

the intervier are entered in a

biographical questionnaire covering all aspects of the agent's

family situation,

political viws,

background and education,

employment experience, connections, and intelligence potential;

the document forms

the basis of the agont's DGI personal file.

In addition, the agent is required to write i complete report on

the operational situation in his country, including types and

styles of dress, eating habits, working hours and holidays,

location of public buildings and places of entertainment, the

press and its type and circulation,

urban and rural tinnsporta-

sducational facilties,

iirlines, personal documents for

Ide:tification, and local lingulstic idions.

In cases where an intelligence agont is selected from

guerrilla trainees, he may romain ulder the

jurisdiction of the

IN Department, which retains him as a guerrilla agent but arranges

for his training as an illegal agint also.

Training for intel

ligence work, however, is alvays sepandte for guerrilla training

not revealed to the Communist Party or leftist group

sponsoring the agent, who becomes, in ffect, a semi-overt Cuban

agent in guerrilla activities and

a clandestine Agent in Intel

One such agent, trained in

Cuba in 1963, was returned to the Dominican Republic about mid-

1963; he carries on revolutionary activities with the Dominican

Only a few agents are trained in the latter

The type of communications training the agent will

country or at the airport just before boarding the plane,

Illegal agents receive a more intensive final briefing. The case

officer reviews with the agent the general mission and

tasks ho is to undertake,

all of which have been covered during

training, such as collection of information on his home govern-

ment or specific organizations, penetration of cificial organs in

the country or perhaps the local Communist Party or a leftist

group, assistance in communications and forwarding of material,

The briefing includes advice on security and self-protection,

refresher instruction on accommodation addresses for sccret

writing correspondence,

an explanation of the travel route for the

return journey and the documents to be used, and specific instruc-

tions for reporting to a group or commencing his assignment after

arrival, with a schedule for initiating communications,

on his mission and his return itinerary.

Illegal agents receive

their final instruction on communications two or three days be-

fore leaving Cuba.

Instructions about frequencies, which are

assigned by the MI Department, and codes. for radio

communication,

If agents are not able to leave Cuba at once when they have com

illegal agents.

They are permitted to travel in Cuba or are

The case officer in-

structs the agents to go to ICAP and establish contact with

"Ricardo", who thereafter is responsible for them as long as they

remain in the country.

If they are delajed, he arranges for

travel in Cuba, and in any case he provides

them subsistence and

pocket money. He also, through ICAP, procures their required

immunizations; an ICAP request for vaccination for a traveler is

an indication that the person is of interest to the Cuban intel

ligence services, since the ordinary departing visitor or resident

secures his immunization through normal civilian channels.

"Ricardo" also obtains airline tickets and flight reservations;

the DGI reimburses ICAP for any funds expended by "Ricardo" for

agent travel and handling.

The processing of illegal

agents is

somewhat different from that

of guerrillas.

They do not

through

ICAP or come into "Ricardo's"

hands; the case officer, working through the Dol Central Process

ing

takes care of procuring their immunizations, plane

tickets, and reservations.

They are thus not exposed to any

Cuban agency outside of the DGI.

however.

the practice of sending

agents home as crowmen has

materially declined and in 196% was

used only occasionally.

Effectiveness of Training

36.

The capabilities of both guerrilla and illegal agents trained by

the DGI vary greatly because of differences in background, native

capacity, and adjustnent to discipline.

The DGI has successfully

trained a few highly efficient agents,

but some of its trainees

have not come up to expectations.

One agont with an excellent

training record, of whom the case officer had high hopes, was

arrested for participation in illegal

activities after only a

short period of operation following his return home.

Several

agents

who were

considered promising proved disappointing when

released from

training supervision; one who was given funds to

purchase a radio spent

the morey on himself and was in trouble

with the group with which he was affiliated because of his lack

of discipline; another was accused of having misused funds en

trusted to him for arms procur-ment and was also distrusted by

his group as cowardly and spiritless.

As noted above, instruc

tion in secret writing has nor always been productive

reports.

The main difficulty appears to lie

not with the quality

of the training but with the lack of discipline and loyalty of

the trained agent.

Headquarters Comments

For a discussion of the organization of the DGI and the

functions

of its departmints, from the same source, see

CS-311/00115-6-.

Cuba has diplomatic relations, and hence consulates, in

Latin America only in Mexico

and Jamaica (relations

maintained with Brazel until May 1964, with Chile unti

July 1964, with Bolivia until August 1961, and with

Uruguay until September 1961).

Visas for Cuba can be

obtained only in those countries; most are issued in

Mexico, because that country has the only direct air

connection with Cuba.

at length by the same
