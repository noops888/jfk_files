® Maheu was told he would receive $35 per day or $17.50 per half

day when his time was involved. He volunteered to place someone
in the Middle East for about one year and also noted that he had
two men on a training mission in the Dominican Republic.

In September 1956, Maheu told his contact in. the Office of
Security that he had been approached to consider performing some
investigative work for the Dominican Republic. He was asked to
report fully to the Office of Security in the event he did travel

informed on the matter (See Tab 3).
According to a report in Maheu's file of an FBI interview
with Allan F. Hughes, an associate of Maheu during this period,
re) Hughes, Maheu, and John Joseph Frank were involved in selling a
quantity of electronic and X-ray detection equipment to the
Dominicans in 1955-1956. Hughes told the FBI that he visited
the U. S. Embassy in Ciudad Trujillo in 1956 when he traveled to
the Dominican Republic to install the X-ray detection equipment.
During that visit, he reportedly informed the U. S. Ambassador
that Maheu had kept CIA fully informed of the equipment trans-
action with the Dominicans before and after its sale. In October
1957, a dispatch from Ciudad Trujillo transmitted information
concerning Maheu which the Dominican Government had passed to US
officials in an apparent attempt to quash proceedings against
Maheu's sometime associate, John Joseph Frank. Frank, a Washington,
D. C., Jeaiay whose activities on behalf of the Dominican
2 Republic were under investigation, was indicted on 13 May 1957

as amended. Frank may have been the source of the information
passed by the Dominicans which alleged that Maheu had been
involved in violation of the Mann Act with the tacit approval of
the Department of State. Maheu's involvement in the Niarchos-
Onassis matter was also included in the Dominican material (See
Tab 2).

Mr. Maheu contacted the Office of Security at this time to
advise that the Mann Act allegations were without foundation and
stated that he would take steps immediately to have his attorney
see that appropriate Dominican officials would retract the charges.
This was subsequently done. Edward Bennett Williams acted as
