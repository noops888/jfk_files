Maheu was told he would receive $35 per day or $17.50 per half

day when his time was involved. He volunteered to place someone

in the Middle East for about one year and also noted that he had

two men on a training mission in the Dominican Republic.

In September 1956, Maheu told his contact in the Office of

Security that he had been approached to consider performing some

investigative work for the Dominican Republic. He was asked to

report fully to the Office of Security in the event he did travel

to the Dominican Republic,

Informed on the matter (See Tab 3).

According to a report in Maheu's file of an FBI interview

with Allan F. Hughes, an associate of Maheu during this period,

Hughes, Maheu, and

John Joseph Frank were involved in selling a

quantity of electronic and X-ray detection equipment to the

Dominicans in 1955-1956. Hughes told the FBI that he visited

the U. S. Embassy in Ciudad Trujillo in 1956 when he traveled to

the Dominican Republic to install the X-ray detection equipment.

During that visit, he reportedly informed the U. S. Ambassador

that Maheu had kept CIA fully informed of the equipment trans-

action with the Dominicans before and after its sale. In October

1957, a dispatch from Ciudad Trujillo transmitted information

concerning Maheu which the Dominican Government had passed to US

officials in an apparent attempt

to quash proceedings against

Maheu's

sometime associate, John

Joseph Frank. Frank, a Washington,

attorney whose activities

on behalf of the Dominican

Republic were under investigation, was indicted on 13 May 1957

for violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938,

as amended. Frank may have been the source of the information

passed by the Dominicans which alleged that Maheu had been

Involved in violation of the Mann Act with the tacit approval of

the Department of State. Maheu's involvement in the Niarchos-

Onassis matter was also included in the Dominican material (See

Tab 2).

MI. Maheu contacted the Office of Security at this time to

advise that the Mann Act allegations were without foundation and

stated that he would take steps immediately to have his attorney

see that appropriate Dominican officials would retract the charges.

This was subsequently done. Edward Bennett Williams acted as

Maheu's lawyer in this matter.
