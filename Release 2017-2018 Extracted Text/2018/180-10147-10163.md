In 1964, the CIA advised the Warren Commission that lar
a ot. |

the Agency never had a relationship of any kind with Lee
Harvey Oswald. Testifying before the Commission, John
A. McCone, who was then Director of Central Intelligence, ~
indicated that Oswald “was not an agent, employee, or
informant of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Agency
never contacted him, interviewed him, talked with him, or
solicited any reports or information from him, or communicated
with him directly or in any other manner...Oswald was never
associated or connected directly or indirectly in any way
whatsoever with the Agency." __/: McCone's testimony was
corroborated by Richard M. Helms, then the Agency's
Deputy Director for Plans and therefore the person directly

responsible for clandestine operations. _/ Once these

; further efforts by the Warren Commission to investigate

this matter.
7 The Committee sought to resolve the issue of Oswald's
J
alleged association with the CIA by conducting an inquiry
that went beyond the threshold level of obtaining statements
j from two of the Agency's most senior officials. Instead,
a more analytical investigative approach was utilized.
First, an effort was made to identify circumstances either
in Oswald's life or in the manner in which his case was
handled by the CIA which were potentially suggestive of an
j intelligence association of -some kind. Then, an intensive

file review was undertaken which included both the CIA's

144-volume Oswald file and hundreds of others from the CIA,
as well as the FBI, State Department, and the Department of

Defense. _/ Based upon these file reviews, a series of

interviews, depositions, and executive Beccio! hearings were
conducted with both Agency and ese witnesses. The
contacts with present and former CIA personnel covered a
broad range of individuals, including staff and division
chiefs, clandestine case officers, area desk officers,
research analysts, secretaries, and clerical asSistants.
In total, more than 125 persons, including at least 50
present and former CIA employees, were questioned
regarding this issue.

The results of this investigation confirmed the
Warren Commission testimony given by Messrs. McCone and
Helms. There was no indication in Qswald's CIA file
suggestive in any way that he had ever had any contact with
the Agency. Moreover, the Agency employees who would have
been in a position to know if Oswald had been associated

Finally, taken~in their entirety, the items of circumstantial
evidence that the Committee had selected for investigation
as possibly indicative of an intelligence association did
not support the allegation that Oswald had an intelligence
agency relationship of some kind.

This finding, however, must be qualified because the

extreme compartmentalization and the complexity of its

enormous filing system, that are designed to preclude

i In addition to obtaining testimony from former

directors John H. McCone and Richard M. Helms, the

individuals categorically denied that Oswald had. ever
been associated in any capacity with the CIA.

To investigate this matter further, the persons who

had been chiefs and/or deputy chiefs during 1959-62 of the

three units within the Soviet Russia division which were

The CIA has long acknowledged that, prior to the

President's assassination, it had a personality file on

Lee Harvey Oswald. This file, which in Agency terminology

is referred to as a 201 file, was opened on December 9, 1960.

opened when a person is considered to be of potential
intelligence or counterintelligence significance. The

opening of such a file is designed to serve the purpose of

individual into one iat hcabeenaitats records system belonging
to the Deputy Directorate for Operations, that component
of the Agency responsible for clandestine activities.

The existence of a 201 file does not necessarily
connote any actual relationship or contact with the CIA.
For example, the Oswald file was purportedly opened
because he was considered to be a potential counterintelligence
threat. Oswald's file contained absolutely no indication that
he had ever had any relationship with the CIA. Nevertheless,
becaise the Committee was aware of at least one instance
(in an unrelated case) where an Agency officer had apparently
contemplated the use of faked files with forged documents, _/
special attention was given to procedural questions that were

occasioned by this file review.

reported that Lee Harvey Oswald, a recently discharged
marine, had appeared at the United States Moscow embassy

approximate time period. ./ Agency officials questioned by
the Committee have testified that the substance of the
October 31, 1959 cable was sufficiently important to warrant
the opening of a 201 file. In fact, however, Oswald's file
was not opened until December 9, 1960.

The CIA was requested by the Committee to indicate
where documents pertaining to Oswald had been disseminated
internally and stored prior to the opening of his 201 file.
In response, the Agency advised the Committee that because
document dissemination records of low national security
significance are retained for only a five-year period, they
are no longer in existence the years 1959-1963. — /
Consequently, the Agency was unable to explain either when

these documents had been received or by which component.

and determined that the files for each of the five (including

Even so, this analysis only explains why a file on
Oswald was finally opened; standing alone it does not explain
the seemingly long delay in the opening of the file. To
determine whether such a delayed opening was necessarily
unusual, the Committee reviewed the files of 13 of the 14
persons on the CIA's 21, 1960 response to the State
od Department and of 16 other defectors (from an original list

of 380) who were American born, had defected during the

years 1958-1963, and who had returned to the United States

was not at all uncommon. In many cases the opening was
triggered by some event, independent of the defection, which
drew attention to the individual involved.

Agency personnel, however, including the person who initiated
the file opening, testified that this must have been occasioned

explain its meaning.

The Agency's Deepanee indicated that "AG" is the OI
("Other Identification") code meaning “actual or potential
defectors to the East or the SINO/SOVIET Bloc including

Cuba," and that anyone so described could have the OL

2
code "AG." This code was reportedly added to Oswald's |
opening form because of the. comment on the form that he had
defected to the Soviet Union in 1959.

An Agency official who was a DDO records expert and
J for many years had been involved in the CIA's investigative

efforts concerning the John F. Kennedy assassination, gave

the Committee a somewhat differént explanation of the

i circumstances surrounding the term "AG" and its placement on
Oswald's opening form. This individual testified that "AG"
was an example of a code used to aid in preparing computer

He explained that these codés always utilized two letters and

Communism, while the second letter would represent some
category within the Communist structure.

His recollection was that at the time of the

assassination the "AG" code was not yet in existence because
there were no provisions then in effect within the Agency for
the indexing of American defectors. He recalled that it was
only during the life of the Warren Commission that the CIA
realized that its records system lacked provisions. for
indexing an individual such as Oswald. Consequently, the

CIA then revised its — to include authorization
for indexing American defectors and established a-code for

its computer system to be used for the category of "American

defectors." Although this individual did not know when the

that it would have to have been following the addition of
the American defector code, thus placing the time somewhere
in the middle of the Warren Commission's investigation. «He
explained that it was difficult to determine when any of the
notations on the opening sheet were made, since it was: standard
procedure to update the forms whenever necessary so that they
were as reflective as possible of the available information.

The form that was used to initiate the opening of Lee

Harvey Oswald's 201 file contains a notation indicating that
oe file.was to be "restricted." This indication was
considered potentially significant because of the CIA's
practice of restricting agents' files to persons on a "need
to know" basis.

Further investigation, however, revealed that restricting
access to a file was not necessarily indicative of any relation-
ship with the CIA.

The individual who a oenaiay placed the restriction on
Oswald's file testified that this was done simply to allow
her to remain aware of any developments that might have
occurred with regard to the file. This purpose was achieved

notify the restricting officer; at that time the restricting
officer could be apprised of any developments possibly
necessitating access to the file by someone else.

This testimony was confirmed by a CIA records expert
who further testified that, had the file been permanently
changed as well as restricted, the possibility of a relationship
with the CIA would have been greater. There was no indication
on Oswald's form that it had been placed on permanent change.

Finally, the Committee reviewed the files of four other
defectors which had a opened at the same time and by the
same person as Oswald's, and determined that each of their
files had similarly been restricted. Each of these other
individuals had been on the list of defectors that had been
exchanged by the CIA and State Department. None of the files

pertaining to these other defectors had any evidence suggestive

documents that had been fully withheld from release under the
Freedom of Information review.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the CIA advised
that because Oswald's file was so active during the course of
the Warren Commission investigation, up-to-date machine listings
were produced periodically. On this basis, the Agency stated
that “it must be assumed that whoever was responsible for
maintaining the Oswald file brought thie file up-to-date by
locating the 37 documents and placing them in the file."

Because this: response was incomplete, the author of
this memorandum was deposed. He testified that once a
document had been registered into a 201 file by the Agency's
computer system, physical placement of the document in the
file was not always necessary. On this basis, he explained

that the items listed in the memorandum were not missing but

In the Oswald case, there were two itens which received
scrutiny because they were potentially indicative of a dual
filing system. The first involved a photograph of -him that
had been taken in Minsk in 1961 and the second concerned a
copy of a letter that had been written to him by his mother
during his stay in the Soviet Union. At the time of
eeecccnG Kennedy's assassination, both of these items were in
the CIA's possession but neither was in Oswald's 201 file.

The first card regarding Lee Harvey Oswald is dated

9 November 1959 and states that Oswald is a recent defector to

the USSR and a former Marine. It also. bears the notation

"CI/Project/RE" and some handwritten notations. The second

card on Oswald places him in Minsk, USSR. It contains

been identified as being of particular interest in the Agency
with respect to the mail intercept program.

The Committee requested the CIA to ‘provide an
explanation for the terms "CI/Project/RE," and. "Watch List,"
and for the significance of the handwritten notations appearing
on the index cards. In addition, the Committee requested a

description of criteria utilized in compiling a "watch list."

In regard to the meaning of the notation "CI/Project/RE,"
the CIA explained that there existed an office within the
.Counterintelligence staff that was known as "CI/Praoject," a
cover title that had been used to hide the true nature of the
office's functions. In fact, this office was responsible for
the exploitation of the material produced by the HT-Lingual
project. The response further explains that "RE" represents

the initials of a former employee who is presently. retired under

cover.

In responding to a request for the criteria used in

compiling a "Watch List," the CIA referred to-a section of

- the Report to the President by the Commission on CIA Activities

within.the United States, which states:

Individuals or organizations of particular intelligence
interest (one should also add counterintelligence
interest) were specified in Watch Lists provided

to the mail project by the Counterintelligence Staff,
by other CIA components, and by the FBI. The total
number of names on the Watch List varied, from time

to time, but on the average, the list included
approximately 300 names, including about 100 furnished
by the FBI. The Watch List included the names of
foreigners and of United States citizens.

Thus, the full meaning of the notation is that on

9 November 1959, RE placed Oswald's name on the “Watch List"

for the HT-Lingual project for the reason stated on the card --—

that Oswald was-a recent defector to the USSR and a former

Marine.

The response goes on to state that the handwritten

number, #7-305, which also appears on the first card, is a
reference to the communication from the CI Staff to the Office
of Security expressing the former's interest in seeing any
mail to or from Oswald in the Soviet Union. Finally, the
: other handwritten notation, "N/R-RI, 20 Nov. 59," signifies
that a name trace run through the central records register
indicates that there was no record for Lee Oswald as per
that date.
fhe Agency's explanation of the meaning of the second
card is that on 7 August 1961, Mrs. Egerter requested that
Oswald's name be placed on the “Watch List" because of
Oswald's expressed desire to return to the U.S. as stated on
the card. The handwritten notation indicates, in this instance,

that Oswald's name was deleted from the "Watch List" on 28 May 19¢€

spear

In reference to the two cards on Marina Oswald, the

Agency stated that her name was first placed on the "Watch
List" on 26 November 1963 because she was the wife of Lee
Harvey Oswald. .The second card served the purpose of adding
i the name Marina Oswald Porter to the "Watch List" on

29 dune 1965 after she remarried. Both names were deleted
from the list as of 26 May 1972.

Thus, the statements of former’ CIA employees were

corroborated by the Agency's response regarding the explanation
of the index cardsin the CIA's HT-Lingual files pertaining to
Oswald. The explanations attested to the fact that the
references on the cards were not demonstrative of an Agency

\ relationship with Oswald, but instead were examples of notations

routinely utilized in connection with the HT-Lingual project.

to the Soviet Union. _/. In a subséquent response, the

Department acknowledged the existence of some evidence that
Oswald had offered information to the Soviet Union, but
stated that there were, nevertheless, serious obstacles to a
possible prosecution:

It (Department file) does contain a copy of
an FBI memorandum, dated July 3, 1961, which
is recorded as having been received in the
Justice Department's Internal Security
Division on December 10, 1963, which states
that the files of the Office of Naval
Intelligence contained a copy of a Department
of State telegram, dated October 31, 1959,

at Moscow. The telegram, which is summarized
in the FBI report, quoted Oswald as having
offered the Soviets any information he had
acquired as a radar operator. The FBI report
did not indicate that the information to
which Oswald had access as a radar operator
was classified.

Oswald returned to the United States on

June 13, 1962. He-was interviewed by the

FBI on June 26, 1962, at Fort Worth,

Texas, at which time he denied furnishing

any information to the Soviets concerning

his Marine Corps experiences. He stated

that he never gave the Soviets any information
which would be used to the detriment of the
United States.

In sum, therefore, the only “evidence”
that Oswald ever offered to furnish
information to the Soviets is his own
reported statement to’ an official at the

of course, was contradicted by his denial
to the FBI, upon his return to the United
States, that he had ever made such an offer.

In the prosecution of a criminal case, the
Government cannot establish a prima facie
case solely on a defendant's unsupported
confession. The Government must introduce
substantial independent. evidence which would
tend to establish the trustworthiness of the
defendant's statement. See, Opper v.

United States, 348 U.S. 84 (1954).

Accordingly, in the absence of any information

that Oswald had offered to reveal classified information
to the Soviets, and lacking corroboration of his
statement that he had proferred information of any

kind to the Russians, we did not consider his
prosecution for violation of the espionage statutes,

18 U.S.C. §§ 793, 793. /

Based upon this analysis, there is no evidence that
Oswald received favorable treatment from either the State
Department or the Justice Department regarding the possibility

of a criminal prosecution.

State’ Department and' Defense Department are consistent with

“DCI statement and a matter of cover" concerning Snyder.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the CIA indicated
that the DCI statement presumably refers to comments which
former DCI Richard Helms had made in 1964 concerning the
Oswald case when Helms had been Deputy Director for Plans.*

The CIA also stated that snyder's file had been flagged at the
request of DDO/CI to ensure that all inquiries concerning
Snyder would be referred to that office. The Agency was unable
to explain the reference to "cover" because according to its
records Snyder had never been assigned any cover while employed.
Further, the Agency stated that “StThere is no record in Mr.

Snyder's Official Personnel File that he ever worked, directly

The Committee does not regard this explanation as
satisfactory, especially since Snyder's 201 file indicates that
for approximately one year during 1956-1957 he was used by an
Agency case officer as a spotter at Harvard University because
of his access to other students who might be going to the
Soviet Union, nor was the Agency actually able to explain
specifically why someone considered it necessary to red
flag the Snyder file.

The remainder of the Snyder file, however, is entirely
consistent with his oe before the Committee concerning
the absence of Agency contacts. In addition, the CIA

personnel officer who handled Snyder's case in 1950 confirmed

that. Snyder had, in fact, terminated his employment with the

involved lectures on Soviet life and instructions on remembering

tour of duty in Moscow, Davison was asked by an Embassy

7. George deMohrenschildt

George deMohrenschildt was a prominent member of Dallas'
White Russian" community who befriended Lee Harvey Oswald.
This friendship has engendered considerable speculation
because of the contrast between the backgrounds of the two men.
DeMohrenschildt was described as sophisticated and well educated,
one who moved easily in the social and professional circles
of oilmen and the so-called "White Russian" community, many
of. whom were avowed right-wingers. Oswald's “lowly" background
did not include much education or influence, and he was, in fact,
shunned by the very same Dallas aateal community which
embraced detiohrenschilat. DeMohrenschildt committed suicide
in 1977 shortly after having been contacted for an interview

by a Committee investigator.

apparent speed with which Oswald's Soviet visa was issued.
Rankin noted that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes
of the State Department who contended that at the time

Oswald received his visa to enter Russia from the Soviet

Embassy in Helsinki, at least one week ordinarily passed

between the time of a tourist's application for a visa and

the issuance of the visa. Rankin contended that if Chayes'

assessment was accurate, then Oswald's ability to obtain

his tourist visa in two days-might have been very significant.

-Rankin, dated September 14, 1964, added that during. the 1964

tourist season, Soviet Consulates in at least some Western
European cities issued Soviet tourist visas in from five to
seven days.

In an effort to resolve this issue, the Committee has
reviewed the CIA file on Gregory Golub, who was the Soviet
Consul in Helsinki when Oswald was issued his tourist’ visa.
Golub's file reveals that, in addition to his Consular
activities, he was suspected to have been an officer
of the Soviet KGB.

Two CIA dispatches from Helsinki concerning Golub

are of particular significance with regard to the time

necessary for issuance of visas to Americans for t¥avel into

the Soviet Union: The first dispatch records that Golub
disclosed during a luncheon conversation that:

Moscow had given him the authority to give
Americans visas without prior approval from
Moscow. He (Golub) stated that this would
make his job much easier, and as long as

he was convinced the American was "all right"
he could give him a visa in a matter of
minutes... (emphasis added)

The second CIA dispatch, dated October 9, 1959, one
day prior to Oswald's arrival in Helsinki, illustrates that
Golub did have’ the authority to issue visas without delay.
The dispatch discusses a telephone contact between Golub
and his consular counterpart ‘at the American Embassy in

Helsinki:

10. The Oswald Photograph in the Office of Naval

Intelligence Files

The Office of Naval Intelligence's Lee Harvey Oswald
file contained a photograph of Oswald, taken at the
approximate time of his Marine Corps induction, that was
contained in an envelope which had on it the language
"REC'D 14 November 1963" and "CIA 77978." These markings
raised the possibility that Oswald had been in some way
associated,.with the CIA.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of
Defense stated that the photograph had been obtained by

ONI as a result of a CIA request for two copies of the most

recent photographs of Oswald so that an attempt could be made

copies, however, were not made available to the CIA until
after the President's assassination. Because of the absence
of documentation, no explanation was given for how or when the
Office of Naval Intelligence received this. particular
photograph of Oswald.

The Committee's review of CIA cable traffic confirmed
that cable number 77978, dated October 24, 1963, was in’
fact a request for two copies of the Department of the Navy's
most recent photograph of Lee Henry (sic) Oswald. Moreover,
review of other cable traffic corroborated the Agency's desire
to determine whether Lee Harvey Oswald had, in fact, been

in Mexico City.

The Committee also considered whether Oswald's activities
and possible associations in Mexico City were indicative of
a relationship between him and the CIA. This aspect of the
Committee's investigation involved a complete review both of
alleged Oswald associates and of various CIA operations outside
of the United States.

The Committee found no evidence suggestive of any
relationship between Oswald and the CIA. Moreover, the
Agency's investigative efforts, prior to thé assassination,
regarding Oswald's presence-in Mexico City served to confirm
the absence of any relationship with him. Specifically, when
apprised of his possible presence in Mexico City, the Agency
both initiated internal inquiries concerning his background

and, once informed of his Soviet experience, notified other

potentially interested federal agencies of his possible
contact with the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. Finally,
the overt nature and frequency of Oswald's contacts with

the Cuban and Soviet Consulates (i.é., a total of at least five

visits) also tended to indicate that Oswald was not under the
direction of any professional intelligence officers.

12. Lee Harvey Oswald's Military Records

The Committee reviewed Oswald's military records because
of allegations that he had received intelligence training
and had participated in intelligence operations during his
:term of service. Particular attention was given to the
charges that Oswald's early-discharge from the Marine Corps
was designed to serve as a cover for an intelligence
assignment and that his records reflected neither his true

security clearance nor a substantial period of service in

Taiwan. These allegations were considered relevant to the

question of whether Oswald had been performing intelligence

issue of Oswald's possible association with the CIA.

he had ever received any intelligence training or performed
on any intelligence assignments during his term of service.

cation. Based upon the Warren Commission testimony of John
E. Donavan, the officer who had been in charge of Oswald's
crew, that all personnel working in the radar center were
required to have a minimum security clearance of secret, the
allegation has been made that the security clearance of
confidential in Oswald's records is inaccurate.. This

allegation, however, was refuted by a review of files belonging

Oswald's military records also dispelled the allegation
that he had served for a substantial period in Taiwan. ‘These
records state that Oswald served in Japan from September 12,

for duty in tidgaiees States.

Accordingly, there is no indication in Oswald's
military records that he had spent any time in Taiwan. This
finding is contrary to that of the Warren Commission that
Oswald arrived with his unit in Taiwan on September 30, 1958, _/
but the Commission's analysis apparently was made without access
to the unit diaries of MAG 11l.*

Finally, with one exception, the circumstances surrounding
Oswald's rapid discharge from the military do not appear to have
been unusual. Oswald was obligated to service on active duty

until December 7, 1959, but he applied for. a hardship discharge

application was processed so expeditiously because it was
accompanied with all of the necessary documentation.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the Department
of Defense has stated that "to a large extent, the time
involved in processing depended on how well the individual
member had. prepared the documentation needed for consideration
of his or her case." / A review of Oswald's case indicates
that his initial application was accompanied by all of the

requirements of having made~a voluntary contribution to the

discharged on September 11, 1959. This explains why he was

two letters and two affidavits attesting to Marguerite

Documents provided to the Committee by the American Red

documentation to support his claim. Indeed, Red Cross officials
interviewed Marguerite Oswald, and concluded that she "could
not be considered employable from an emotional standpoint." ey
The Fort Worth Red Cross Office indicated a quarters allotment

Oswald, and raised the possibility that he had intelligence
associations of some kind. The Committee's investigation,
however, revealed that military intelligence officials had
opened a file on Oswald because he was perceived as a possible
counterintelligence threat.

Robert E. Jones testified before the Committee that in
June of 1963 he had been serving as Operations Officer of the
1i2th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.*
Under the Group's control were seven regions encompassing five

states: Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

Jones rélated that on November 22, 1963, while in his
quarters at Fort Sam Houston, he heard about the assassination
of President Kennedy. Returning immediately to his office, he
contacted MIG personnel in Dallas and instructed them to
intensify their liaisons with federal, state, and local
agencies and to report back any information obtained. Early
that afternoon, he received a telephone call from Dallas
advising that an A.J. Hidell had been arrested or had come to
the attention of law enforcement authorities. Jones checked
the MIG indices, which indicated that there was a file on Lee
Harvey Oswald, also known by the name A.J. Hidell. Pulling the
file, he telephoned the local FBI office in San Antonio to
notify the FBI that he had some information. He soon was in
telephonic contact with the Dallas FBI office, to which he

summarized the documents in the file. He believes ‘that ‘one

twelve Military Intelligence agents who performed liaison
functions with the Secret Service in Dallas on the day of the
assassinatitn. This “after action" report was then maintained

The Committee found Jones! testimony to be very credible.

His statements concerning the contents of the Oswald file

are consistent with FBI communications that were generated as
a result of the information which he initially provided.
Access to Oswald's Military Intelligence file, which the
Department of Defense never gave to the Warren Commission, was
not possible because the Department of Defense had destroyed
the file as part of a general program aimed at eliminating all
of its files pertaining to nonmilitary personnel. In

response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of Defense
gave the following explanation for the file's. destruction:

1. ‘Dossier AB 652876, OSWALD, Lee Harvey, was
identified for deletion from IRR (Intelligence
Records and Reports) holdings on Julian date
73060 (1 March 1973) as stamped on the micro-
filmed dossier cover. It is not possible to
determine the actual date when physical _
destruction was accomplished, but is. credibly
surmised that the destruction was accomplished
“within a period not greater than sixty days
following the identification for deletion.

Evidence. such as the type of deletion record
available, the individual clerk involved in

the identification, and the projects in progress
at the time of deletion, all indicate the dossier
deletion resulted from the implementation of a
Department of the Army, Adjutant General letter
dated 1 June 1971, subject: Acquisition of
Information Concerning Persons and Organizations
not Affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD)
(Incl 1). Basically, the letter called for the
elimination of files on non-DOD affiliated
persons and organizations.

2. It is not possible to determine who accomplished
the actual physical destruction of the dossier.

The individual identifying the dossier for deletion
can be determined from the clerk number appearing

on the available deletion record. The number
indicates that Lyndall E. Harp was the identifying
clerk. Harp was an employee of the IRR from 1969
until late 1973, at which time she transferred

to the Defense Investigative Service, Fort Holabird,
Maryland, where she is still a civil service
employee. The individual ordering the destruction
or deletion cannot be determined. However, available
evidence indicates that the dossier was identified
for deletion under a set of criteria applied by

IRR clerks to all files. .The basis for these
criteria were established in the 1 June 1971 letter.
There is no indication that the: dossier was specifically
identified for review.or deletion. All evidence
shows that the file was reviewed as part of a
generally applied program to eliminate any dossier
concerning persons not affiliated with DOD.

3. The exact material contained in the dossier
cannot be determined at this time. However,
discussions with all available persons who recall
seeing the dossier reveal that it most probably
included: newspaper clippings relating to pro-

-Cuban activities of Oswald, several Federal

Bureau of Investigation reports, and possibly

some Army counterintelligence reports: None of

signifieant information in the dossier. It should
be noted here that the Army was not asked to
investigate the assassination. Consequently, any
Army derived information was turned over to the
appropriate civil authority.

4. At the time of the destruction of the Oswald
dossier, IRR was Operating under the records
disposal authority contained in the DOD Memorandum
to Secretaries of the Military Departments, OASD(A),
9 February 1972, subject: Records Disposal
Authority (Incl 2). The memorandum forwards
National Archivist disposal criteria which is
similar in nature to the requirements outlined

in the 1 June 1971 instructions. It was not

until 1975 that the Archivist changed the criteria
to ensure non-destruction of investigative records
that may’ be of historical value. cs

Upon receipt of this information, the Committee
orally requested the destruction order relating to the file
on Oswald. In a letter dated September 13, 1978, the General
Counsel of the Department of, the Army replied that no such
order existed:

Army regulations do not require any type of

specific order before intelligence files can be
destroyed, and none was prepared: in connection

with the destruction of the Oswald file. As a rule,
sinvestigative information on persons not directly
affiliated with the Defense Department can be retained
in Army files only for short periods of time and in
carefully regulated circumstances. The Oswald file

intelligence files annually. /

The Committee finds this "routine" destruction of the

Ne

Oswald file extremely troublesome, especially when viewed in
} light of the Department of Defense's failure to make this file
{ available to the Warren Commission. Despite the credibility
of Jones' testimony, without access to this file the question

of Oswald's possible affiliation with military intelligence

cannot be fully resolved. The absence of this file, however,
has no bearing upon the Committee's conclusion concerning
the absence of any relationship between Lee Harvey Oswald

and the CIA.
