11 January 1996

Note to: C/HRG

Subject: Meeting with ARRB Staff, 5 January 1996

1. Marwell stated very strongly that without an appeal

to the President, the Agency will have little credibility.

His staff is finding it more and more difficult to defend

Agency positions. To date, the Board has been able to tell

the staff "told you so"

to the Board concerning Given the strong statements made

, the Agency should appeal.

We need to demonstrate a willingness to go to the President.

It not, Marwell expects a continued erosion of the Agency's

ability to protect information in these documents.

2. Gunn and Mary McAuliffe seconded Marwell's comments

and emphasized the need to have our best defense upfronti

Mary said her credibility with the Board was almost shot.

They are particular concerned about the second "name day"

scheduled at the end of this month.
