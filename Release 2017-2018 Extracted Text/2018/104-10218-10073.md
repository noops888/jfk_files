REDTOP - Soviet Propaganda Activities
Tica REQUIRED - REFERENOCE

1. LI¥EAT of 9 February 1967 reports that Sovict Press
Attache Nikoiay Sergeyevich LEONOV (201-152129) asked the
printer of the Soviet Information Bulletin in ico, Jose
HERNANDEZ Azorin, to make up "the same list we did for Chile,
but for the Colombian addresses." Azorin said that ne would have
the list ready in ten days and send it (to Moscow).

2. The above probably means that the names and addresses
of Chilean subscribers to the Bulletin printed in Mexico were
sent to Chile when the Soviets started their new magazine there.
It thus appears that the Soviets may now be about to put out

a magi ne in Colonbia and that the Colombian addresses oa file
in biexico will similarly be sent to Colombia.
