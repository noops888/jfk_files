1739 in Moscow. Her husbans, Valeri

sunRock, was born on

29 October 1937. They wero married in 1963 and their daughter

USSP

At the time that

tho british brothers knew the ZMITROOks, he (Valerty) was an So(u)

engineezing student.

At that time the Z MITROOKs realded at

8 Vladireiralaya,

artment 31, House 23, Moscow E * 123.

The name ZMITROQI is reported above as transmitted to

ua by the

We belteve, however, that the ending ayllable does (S)

not ropresent a correct traneliteration and may be an attempt to

record the name as given to tar

phonetically.

We believe the S)

proper troneliteration would be ZUNTRUK. Please note that the

have also ipelled the name as SMITROOK.

7.

Going on the assumption that a destitute American would

turn to the Embassy for assistance, we would approciate your checking

with the limbasay in Moscow, whether they could possibly Identify

the Amorican who ran short of fundo and borrowed money from Xima

ZMITROOK. Based on the information supplied by the

S

would presume that the American borrowed the money trom her sore-

turne before phe left Intouriet in 1963.

We would aloo appreciate your

acking the Embasay if they have any other information on the ZMITROOKe.
