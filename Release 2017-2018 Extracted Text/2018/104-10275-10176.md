MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT; Meeting with AMBANG-1

l. I met with AMBANG-1 on 27 July 1963 in Miami.

The following is a resume of the business transacted at that

meeting.

a. Request for High Explosives

AMBANG-I stated that in view of my outline

of strategic targets inside Cuba during our last meeting which

took place in Washington on 21 June 1963, he had decided to

attempt a sabotage operal on against the Havana power plant.

He informed me that he has a man employed in the power plant

In Havana who is capable of launching thie operation. In this

connection AMBANG-] asked if we could make available twenty

pounde of high explosives as well as six to eight thermite grenades.

AMBANG-l asked if it were postible to have the twenty pounde. •

broken into smaller lots.

In our further discussion of this subject,

it became apparent that A-l would be willing to receive the materiel

either in San Juan or inside Cuba, but that he definitely preferred

the latter if thie were possible. Like in mist other instances during

our conversation, I advised AMBANG-] that I would need to discuss

this matter with my superiors but that i could tentatively assure

him of our ability and willingness to furnish the high explosivee in

San Juan and possibly inside Cuba. At this point I asked AMBANG-1

1f he could foresee the need for materiel of this type inside Cuba.

I told him that I asked this question because if his group were

prepared now or in the near future for meaningful sabotage action

Inside Cuba it was conceivable that we could begin the caching of

needed materiel inside Cuba. AMBANG-I ansured me that thay

were in a position to sabotage the electrical plant in Havana. (I

did not ask, neither did he specify which plant. ) He did not promise

immediate action, adding that he wanted to assure himsell of the

details of the planned operation and the safety-odds of the man

involved. A-l then indicated that he would certainly be in a

position to accomplish this mission and others in the future and

would be most grateful for any materiel we could put in place.

I left the matter with him with the understanding that if it were

possible we would proceed with caching the high explosives in

the general arca of Havana. He assured me of their capability

to ferrice and retrieve the cache.

b. Request for Contact in Cuantanamo

AMBANG-1 asked me if it would be possible for us

to arrange some means for Rogelio Cieneros to visit Guatanamo

and talk to his brother who is an employee of the Naval Base and

another agent of theirs likewise employed there. The reason A-1

gave for the request was that they wished to inform Ramon Cisneros

Dias of the JURE plans to begin the implementation of their plan

of resistance and overthrow of the Castro Regime. I adrised A-1

that whereas I would look into this matter as I could tentatively

tell him that the chances of accomplishing this were remote.

c. AMBANG-1 Political Plans

AMBANG-I informed me that he was planning at

this time to be in New York on or about 10 August and that following

this trip he intended to go to Santo Domingo and Caracas. In Santo

Domingo he hoped to set up a small base for operations such as a

small house on a farm near the shore which could be used for boat

travel to Cuba. Once he had made such arrangements he intended

to talk to President Jüan Bosch telling him of the plan and asking

his acquiescence if not support. AMBANG-] intenda to tell Boach

that he will not embarrass him and will go about his businese in a

secure and professional manner adding that if he should embarrass

Bosch, the latter could disclaim him and A-l would desist from

any further activity there.

So far as AMBANG-l'8 trip to Caracas is concerned, that.

will be principally devoted to orienting the JURE representation

in that city. In addition, AMBANG-] will attempt to see and talk

to Venezuelan Government officials including President Betancourt.

Some time after this trip AMBANG-1 intends to visit

Central America principally Costa Rica and if he can procure a

visa, Mexico. The purpose of all his travel is the raising of funds,

the general tightening of his organization and discussione neccasary

to coordinate their efforts.

d. Isolation of Cuba.

AMBANG-1 made it exceedingly clear that the

lifeline to his assets inside Cuba had been severely restricted

when PAA flights were suspended.

Nothing could suit AMBANG-1

more than to have these flights resumed. AMBANG-l's obviously

great interest in the resumpti on of these flights was the most eloquent

statement yet of his belief that he has a network, or that he can

revive a network within Cuba.

At least at this stage of JURE

operations,. AMBANG-l does not appear to consider the infiltration

of manpower as necessary.

AMBANG-1 stated that the use of flights from Spain and

Mexico to Cuba was difficult and costly whereas the Miami-Havana

run had been most useful in maintaining contact within Cuba. It

was AMBANG-l's opinion that the resumption of PAA flights would

be an operational boom to JURE and that whereas he could see

Castro making some political capital out of the flights, he believed

that some appropriate statement such as "there is no political

significance but only a humanitarian and compassionate rcason for

the reestablishment of this link, " would be sufficient to pegate any

political advantage by Castro.

AMBANG-1 Phasing Ou: of his Employment

AMBANG-I gave me to believe that he is cloeing shop

and giving up his position with the Corporacion de Renovacion Urbana

y Viviendas where he is employed as an engineer in charge of building

pre-cast concrete houses.

AMBANG-I stated that during the past

week Governor Muno? Marin gave final authority for the erection

of a plant to produce these houses in Puerto Rica. AMBANG-I is

torn with the thought of leaving this project which he believes

will be most successful, and which would assure his livellhood,

but he know's that he must devote himaelf to the fight against

Castro.

It ie obvious to me that AMBANG-I will within the next

two months phase out of this employment to devote full time lo

the liberation of Cuba.

1. A JURE Radio Link

AMBANG-I asked me if I would be able to assist

him in the establishment of a San Juan-Caracas-Miami radio link.

He explained that the JURE has spent a great deal of money on

telephonic communications between these points and were most

anxious to set up a means of radio communication in order to

economize. I guess that AMBANG-1 could tell from my reaction

that I was not too sympathetic to his request for he withdrew it

almost as soon as he had made it.

He went on to say that this

was a problem which they could overcome and I presume that he

will seek to establish such radio communications without our

assistance.

§. Aerial Mapa of Cuba

AMBANG-! informed me that the JURE membership

had brought out of Cuba an entire series of maps showing key roads,

bridges, industrial plants, et al, which they had copied by the Aero

Service Corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

AMBANG-1

stated that they had rcceived most of these photos from the Aero

Service Corporation but that the 101 were still missing. He gave

me the numbers of those missing and asked if we could procure them.

I have since informed AMBANG-1 that it would perhaps be best it

he could, or his organization, do this instead but that we would

pay the travel of one of his men, should this prove necessary.

Attached, hereto, is a copy of the missing photos in question.

h. JURE Organization and Strength

AMBANG-l informed me that the membership of the

JURE in San Juan was now at about 500 members and that each

of these individuals makes a weekly contributionto the organization.

Iro addition there are large JUNE organizationa in Caracas, Venezuela

and Dallas, Texas. There Are according lo AMBANG-! & lotal

of thirty delegationa in Latin America, the U.S. A. and Europe.

Ho cited as an example the delegation in San Francisco which had

recently purchased a typewriter through the collection of green

He added that Rogolio Cieneros had pravelled to San

Francisco some time ago to communicate with that group and lo

tighten its organizational activitice.

1. AHANG-I AskE About ARTIME and the Activities

in Central America

AMBANG-I raised the question of Manuel ARTIME'S

activities in Central America and particularly in Nicaragua. He

stated that any association with Somoza would not help in creating

the mistigue and political coloration necessary to inspire revolution

and resiatance from the non-Communists clements in Cuba. Whereas,

I had expecied AMBANG-I to go into a long harangue as to the

positive damage that ARTIME'e actions with Somoza could cause,

he left the matter al about this point.

I agreed that the Somozas did not

have a liberal political reputation throughout Latin America, but

added that whatever Cubans could do from that or any vantage point

against Communism in Cuba would in my estimation be helpful, -

while I am sure AMBANG-I did not agree with me, he did not say

50, In respect to ARTIME and Miro Cardona, whose name entered

into the conversation later, AMBANG-1 look a fairly objective view.

He stated that Miro had arrived in San Juan and that he wished him

the best as he figured he had suffered enough. Insofar as ARTIME

was concerned I gathered that AMBANG 4 might feel that the associ

ation with Somoza would not do ARTIME any good in a post- Castro

Cuba. Ae AMBANG-l is couvinced that a government after Castro

must be of a progresaive liberal stripe, ARTIME was not doing

himself any good by identifying himself with the Somozas.

J. A List of Cuban Diplomats

As AMBANG-I had asked for a liet of Cuban Diplo-

mats abroad while we were in Paris, I advised him that such a list

had been prepared and we would make it available to him. In this

connection he asked if we could include the addresses of each of the

Cuban installations. Speaking of diplomats, AM BANG-I wanted 80

know 18 Ambassador Gustavo Arcos had returned from Prague.

1 informed him that I did not know. AMBANC-I was most interested

to learn that Franquie wife and children had acrually come out of

Cuba, and indicated that he would intensify his efforts to maintain

contact with Cuban Diploma! Cabrera Infante in Brussele as a

means toward the eventual recruitment of Franqui.

k. AMBANG-1 Relation with Jorge Yolaky

In conjunction with questione regarding propaganda

sent to Cuba, and the JURE' general plans in this ficld, 1 asked

A-l about his relation with Jorge Voloky, A-I stated that be con-

sidered Volsky to be an extremely able, serious newspaperman.

He added that whereas he saw Volsky frequently on hio trips to

Miami, the latter did not work for him.

A-I stated that Volsky's

work was a full-time job which left him little time to do anything

else.

A-l stated that JURE propaganda was produced by a twelve -

man board.

A-l added that the JURE expected to shortly introduce a

atatement on ite position into Cuba.

1. AMBANG-I Asks about Two Man Underwater Craft

A-l asked if 1 knew anything about a two man type

craft which travels through the water. I presume A-l was talking

about the "sca-sled. " I advised him that 1 know little about thie

type crall, but in my opinion ite usefulneas for the type activity

he had in mind was limited. AMBANG-I would use this craft for

the final phase of an infiltration effort. A-l stated that thie craft

was being used at the hotel beaches in San Juan as a type of sporting

activity, I will advine him that he could pursue this matter himself

as all knowledge on thie subject is publicly avallable.

2. General Observations

I beleive AMBANG-| is planning lo return to Cuba.

He indicated that he would give the matter serious thought to

even go in, disguised, as a legal traveller if that road were

senerally open, i.e.. If rather large numbers of travellere were

going in via PAA Miphts. This line seemed a bit out of character

for A-l, for it seema unrealistic and somewhat remindful of Macaulay's

references to the state of mind that exiles develop. I also detecied

what we consider to be a somewhat unrealistic appraisal of the Cuban

situation in A-l's estimate that Castro has conciderably less than

40% of the Cuban people with hir?. A-I may be losing more than a

little touch with Cuban rcality,

A-I remaine convinced that he is on the right track in

working for the eventual overthrow of Castro.

He is convinced,

however, that two to three years is all the time left for actually

destroying the Castro regime, belicving that there will be a favorable

turn in the Cuban economic situation by late 1965.

A-l is likewise

convinced that Castro cannot add to the improvement of Cuba, to

the contrary that so long as the principal decisions arc made by

Castro, the general trend will be confusion arising from a failure

to concentrate on specific problema until they are corrected.

AMBANG-I l8 likewise convinced that the JURE ia building

• political group and general outlook which will have an impact on

Cuba for many yeare to come. He is especially concerned with the

need to carefully consider each position of his groy in order to

create the lasting impression that JURE knows where it is going

and that its leadership is composed of men who know how to "run"

& country withoud the false starts, confusion and chaos identified

with the Castro regime.

AMBANG-1 is likewise greatly concerned with the neceasity

of not creating an impression inside Cuba that the JURE will return

o mete out "justice. " It is essential, A-l states, to convince the .

eneral populace that the overthrow of Castro will not result in a

bloodbath, rather that the sole aim is to save the revolution that

has been betrayed.

He da anxioua that the people inside Cuba see
