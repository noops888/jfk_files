"Prof. PECK said police had clubbed him down last
night on Hichigan Ave near the Conrad Hilton Hotel while he
was urging the peace demonstrators to disperse.

"Ge said they apparently singled him out because
he wie using a bull-horn, or Loudspeaker, asking the crown
to break up, and thus was easily spotted. He said he had
just reached the scene after trying in vain to obtain a
permit for a march to the convention hall.

"His left hand was broken and he sustained.a mimber
of bruises and a scalp cut, which required five stitches.

‘tartor knocking me down,’ he said, ‘they dragged
me sone distance to one of their vans and took me to a district
police station. From there I was taken to Cook County
Hospital for treatment.’

"*fhe Antiwar movement is a most diversified

the teachings of Regis Debray and are debating the merits
of armed struggle. But this is an extremely small faction.'

The machine had some difficulty in Chicago, of course.

"Our protest there became a counterpoint to the
convention. We had some delegates coming down to the protests

, because they wanted to be among the dissidents. They knew
the immorality of war and racism.

“'fhe bureaucratic machine in Chicago was wound
up so tight it could not come up with a felxible response.
That is the difference between a Mayor (JOHN V.) LINDSAY

Some Like LINDSAY don't make the machine response. We got
our parade permit when we marched in New York. There were no

Last Friday, wa neld a press conference to announce local plans to support
the peace action in Chicago and to call our attention to the non-violent charac-
tex of the events scheduled by the National Mobilization Committee during the
week of ssugust 24-29, While the media coverage was excellent, there still ap-
pears to be mmor and speculation «- as well as outright fabrication -- reported
in some newspapers as to the intentions of the Chicago ilobilization. A nationally
circulated Scxipps-Howard Story, printed in the Cleveland Press, Monday, Auguat
19, is rife with inflamatory statements which only serve to intimidate the rany
thousands of parsons who want to come to Chicago and demonatxatrea Gn the Yunda-
mental issues of miZitarism and racisn. :

1

_ But this is the way of the Establishment to "leak" theix intelligence xeporta
to the press in order to divide and viliZy the paace forces, I£ one looks back
to the "intelligence leaka" a year ago lest April or last October, then one will
find a great similarity in the approach. The point is -- we should not believe
these insider reports just as we a not beliove the "official leaks" coming out
of Vietnam -- or the "official stoxies! about what is happening in the chettoes
at home. The credibility gap also extends to the Administration xeporting about
our intentions and actions. We have to be our own zaporters and analysts of
what wa intend to do’and how we go about doing it.

The most important thing to keap in mind is that the best way to insure that
our protests will be peaceful and non-violent is to be there in the tes of
thousands. The best protection we hava against police violence xvests upon the
great numbers of persons who refuse to be intimidated by the military. If we
xeally believe that the war in Vietnam is as barbaric and brutal as we say it
is -- i£ we really believe that millions of blacks suffer the indignities of
racist oppression -- if we really believe that the affluence of this society is
built upon the blatant exploitation of the poor ~» if we believe all this and
more «= then we should be in Chicago to tell the world "like it is" -- and rot let
LBJ or Daly oy any “inside! news report turn us around! We should never be afraid
to demonstrate our demand to put an end to the old politics of militarism and
racism «= and begin a new politics of sanity and humanity in this country.

"Prof. SIDNEY PECK, Case Western Reserve
University faculty mesber and leader of the peace
demonstration here, was beaten and hospitalized last
night and teday appeared in court.

"Charged with aggravated assault, disorderly
conduct and resisting arrest, Prf. BECK was released on
$2000 bond. He was accompanied by a Chicago lawyer, GEORGE
BERNS.

.

"Prof, PECK said police had clubbed him down last
night en Michigan Ava near the Conrad Hilton Hotel while he-
was urging the peace demonstrators to disperse.

"He said they apparently singled him out because
he was using a bull-horn, or loudspeaker, asking the crown
toe break up, and thus was ersily spotted. He said he had -
just reached the scene after trying in vain to obtain a
permit for a march to the convention hail.

“His left hand was broken and he sustained a number
of bruises and a scalp cut, which required five stitches.

“tatter knocking me down,’ he said, ‘they dragged
me some distance to one of their vans and took me to a district
police station. Fron there I was taken to Cook County
Hospital for treatment.‘

“YOUSHS REJECTED 3 PEACE PLANS ON RIOT
NIGRT, POLICE SAY

"The frontline commander of Chicago police during
the Democratic National Convention described here how he held
a ‘gunait weeting' with young radical leadera shortly
before the Aug. 28 battle of Michigan Ave,

“Deputy Police Supt. JAMES H, ROCHFORD said he
offered three alternatives to the protesters’ planned march
on the International Amphitheatre, site of the convention,

"ALL threa suggestions were summarily rejected,
said ROCHFORD, and the unlikely meeting between the police
commander and the Leaders of the demonstration ended on this
harsh note:

: “IDAVID DELLINGER (head of the National Mobilization
Committee to End the Yar in Vietnam} stated emphatically that
there were no alternatives acceptable to him or his people,’
ROCHFORD said.

"iis parade warshals reported to him that they
had penetrated police Lines and were regrouping nearby on
Michigan Ave.

"At that time, DELLINGER turned and walked away
from ue.’

"A bleody melee followed in front of the Conrad.
Bilton Hotel on the night the Democrats nominated Vice
President HUBERT 0, HUHPHREY -~ cecupant of a hotel suite
£5 floors above the street -~ as their presdential candidate.

"ROCHFORD, deputy superintendent, in charge of
field services, was the man in charge of overall security
during the convention. He directed police operations fron
the street.

"ROCHFORD said leaders of the planned Amphitheatre
march, other than DELLINGER, first approached him to ask
for alternatives to the march. This is how ROCHFORD re-
membors it:

"?'There were two specific times when a Mr. SIDNEY
PECK and other designated leaders came and asked for
police alternatives, which we offered to then.‘

"(PECK is sociology professor at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland and a Leader of the Mobilization
Movement, Later that-night, during the fracas on Michigan
Ave, ha was arrested after he allegedly punched ROCHFORD
in the mouth. ROCHFORD wouldn't comment on that incident
beenuse, he seid, it was yet to be resolved in court).

‘NOCHFORD said PECK and the others replied that only
DELLINGER could make a final decision om:tue alternation,
‘Sq I accompanied them to meet with Mr. DELLINGER,' said
ROCHFORD,

"The snub by DELLINGER followed, he added."

“DR, PECK BEATSN BY CHICAGO POLICE

’ “Dy. SIDNEY BECK squinted as he looked into the
eloudiess sky yesterday afternoon, talking abowt the
Conrad Hilton Hotel incident, which he has suddently achieved
@ prominence in thet lexicon which also includes such piace
nanes 2s Dirminghan, Selma and Memphis.

"Dr. BECK is a saclology professor at Case

and toss him inte a police wagon,

"Yesterday afternoon PECK ~ now free on $2,000 bond
after being charged with resisting arrest, aggravated assault
and disorderly conduct ~ was back at the scene of the bloody
events of the previous night. He was wondering what would
happen to him next. He was a little frightoned.

* "tHow do you explain if?' PECK asked, '‘J°LL
tell you it was the most vicious thing I’ve ever seen.
They acted in the grand fascist manner of the police
state, but that doesn't explain it, really.

"*¥You had to be there to see it. Even then you'd
still be frightened and incoherent about it.’

- : "PECK, an officer in the National Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Vietnam, was in the forefront of
a group of demonstrators when they were stopped at Dalbo
Drive and Michigan Avenue near the hotel.

"He was carrying a bullhorn and was one of
the group's directors. When the police set up lines to
prevent the protesters frem leaving the srea, it wag
BECK who went forward to negotiate with the police.

"Look PECK said he told the police captain
heading the operation. ‘We have a lot of angry peopie
kere. If you keep us penned in like this, there is bound
to be trouble. Why not let us go through? At Lerst give us

let this happen. °

"The police were not in a mood to negotiate,
BECK said. -He could make no bargain with them. As it
turned out, all the policemen were waiting for, apparently,
was darkness. Once the srea was suffieiently shrouded,
the police moved in, wave after wave of them, swinging their
elubs xt any human form they could reach.

"SY saw them coming at-me,* PECK said, and it sounded
odd because he said it with such an intellectual f4sir.

"We had this training program, you know, and
we know hoy to protect ourselves when police come after us
with clubs. I.went down to the ground and assumed the
fetal position. I put beth my hands over my head to
protect myself.

"But the thing that hurts worse, and this was
exeruciating, was when they finally spread me out. And
another policeman charged at me then and rammed his night=-
stick between my legs.

"There was such an electric shock of pain that
I tought I was geig to die.t

"isorderly conduct in disturbances during the convention.
He sturned hone yesterday.

"His right forefinger was broken, four stitches
were taken in his scalp and his back still bears dozens
of black and blue marks.

"fhe Antiwar movenent is a most diversified
thine’ he said. 'fhere is plenty of discussion and
disagreement, I think some of the kids who've keen in the
movement three or four years are beginning toe consider
the teachings of Regis Debray and are debating the merits
of armed struggle. But this is an extremely small fuction.'

“Debray, a French journalist, was convicted of aiding
guerrillas in Bolivia.

"Most of the kids who were in Chicago were
intensely committed to the electoral precess,* FECK said.
The kids saw two conventions grind out machine candidates,
The machine had some difficulty in Chicago, of course.

*tOur protest there became a counterpoint to the
convention. We had some delegates coming down to the protests

, because they wanted to be among the dissidents. They knew

the immorality of war and racisn,

"“'?he bureaveratic machine in Chicago was wound
up so tight it could not come up with a felsxible response.
That is the difference between a Mayor (JOHN V.) LINDSAY
(of New York) and a Mayor (RICHARD J.) DALEY (of Chicago).
Some like LINDSAY don't make the machine response. We got
our parade permit when we marched in New York. There were no
billy clubs used there.* :

"Dr. PECK said the anti-war movement suffered
‘deep, disastrous’ losses with the assassinations of the
Rev. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. and Sen, ROBERT F, KENNEDY.

"*BOBBY KENNEDY could have united the working
nan and the intellectuals against the war,' he said.
MARTIN LUTHER KING could have led the black people against
the war.

“At a hearing in Chicago later this month, Dr. PECK
said, he will seek a trial continuance until after the
Novenber elections."

Last Friday, wa held a press conference to announce local plans to support
the peace action in Chicago and to call our attention to the non-violent charace
tex of the events scheduled by the National Mobilization Committee during the
woek of sugust 24-29, While the media coverage was excellent, there still ape
pears to be mmor and speculation -- as well ag outright fabrication -- reported
in some newspapers as to the intentions of the Chicago Wobilization. A nationally
circulated Scxipps-Howard Story, printed in the Cleveland Press, Monday, August
19, is rife with inflamatory statements which only serve to intinidate the many
thousands of persons who want to come to Chicago and demonatxake On the Funda
mental issues of mizitarism and racism,

But thig is the way of the Establishment to "Leak" theix intelligence xeports
to the press in order to divide and vilify the peace forces. if one looks back
to the "intelligence leaks" a year ago last April or last October, then one will
find a gxcat similarity in the approach, The point ia -- we should not believe
these insider xeports just as we d not belicve tho "official leaks" coming out
of Vietnam -- or the "official stories" about what ia happening in the chettoes
at home. The credibility gap also extends to the Administration reporting about
our intentions and actions. We have to be our own xaportera and analysts of
what wea intend to do ‘and how we go about doing it.

The most important thing to keep in mind ig that the best way to insure that
our protests will be peaceful and non-violent is to be there in the tens of
thousands, The best protection we have against police violenca xests upon the
great numbers of persons who refuse to be intimidated by the military. IZ wo
really believe that the war in Vietnam is as barbaric and brutal as we say it
is -- if we really believe that millions of blacks suffer the indignities of
xacist oppression -- if we really believe that the affluence of thig society is
built upon the blatant exploitation of the poor -~ if we believe all this and
more «= then we should be in Chicago to tell the world "like it is" -- and not let
LBJ ox Daly or any "inside't news report turn us around! We should never be afraid
to demonstrate our demand to put an end to the old politics of militarism and
xacism «~ and begin a new politics of sanity and humanity in this country.

"PROTEST LEADER HERE DENIES RIGT CHARGES

"Plans for demonstrations at the Democratic
Nationri Convention in Chicago were no different than
these set up prior to dozens of other anti-war protests -—~
most of them son<violent.

"That was the response today by a Cleveland
anti-war leader to a charge by a House Un-American
Activities Committee (HUAC) investigator that the Cleveland
Area Peace Action Council was instrumental in planning
street disorders in Chicago.

"The basic fact is that the young people did
not act until they were beaten upon by police,’ said
ie, SIDNEY PECK, chairman of the Ohio Peace Action Council
and co-chairman of the National Hobilization Comaittes to
End the War in Vietnas."

“This was the response of Dr. SIDNEY M. PECK,
Cleveland sociclegy professor and cochairman of the National
Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, to
implications that preconvention preparations here indicated
intent to commit violence.

‘'To construe this as an attempt to riot is
just fantastic, PECK said.

: was the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs’ of America (DCA), (a characterization -
of which.gppears in the Appendix Section of this report);
however; at the present time the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA), (a characterization of which appears in the Appendix
Section of this report) and the SWP are actually formulating
the policy of the anti-war committees around the country. He
stated that part of this was due to the fact that in the
Cleveland area SIDNEY ,PECK has had to compromise his position
in order to stay alive in the anti-war movement. [ROSENSHINE]
stated that the YSA has seen to the fact that PECK has not
been able to present’ his line of non-inhvolvement in Vietnam
but has forced him to support the "Bring the Troops Home Now"
policy advocated by the YSA. 7

2, One white hate group was the target of an
entry in March, 1966.

A recent survey of policies and procedures of the
Genoral Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions
at FRIUQ with respect to surreptitious entries, disclosed
that with the exception of entries made for the purpose of
installation of authorized electronic surveillances, the
technique of surreptitious entry has not been used in criminal
investigations.

A list of specific targets has been prepared for
review by Senators Church and Tower, and appropriate FBIEQ
officials are available for a discussion of this list.

NOTE:

A memorandum containing specific targets has been
prepared and is available for use by FBIHQ officials should
pain Church and Tower request a meeting to examine the
list.

Task Force, to Mr. Michael EB. Shaheen, Jdr., Special Counsel
for Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Leputy Attorney
General, wherein Mr. ELIif£ made the following request with
respect to domestic targets of surreptitious entries con-
ducted by the FBI:

1. Statistics on the volume of such surreptitious
entries in inclusive categories such as "subversive,"
"white hate," organized crime,” or "“miscellancous." These
statistics should be cleared for public disclosure.

2. Committee access at FBI Headquarters to a
complete list of specific targets, represented by the
statistics in Item 1, above.

3. Delivery to the Chairman and Vice Chairman
of the list of specific targets requested for access in
Item 2, above,

With respect to this request, from 1942 to April,
1968, surreptitious entry was utilized by the FBI on a highly
selective basis in the conduct of certain investigations.

Re: Surreptitious Entries - Domestic Targets

When a Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of a field
office considered surreptitious entry necossary to the
conduct of an investigation, he would make his request to
the appropriate Assistant Director at FBIHOQ, justifying
the need for an entry and assuring it could be accon-
plished safely with full security. In accordance with
instructions of Director J. Edgar Hoover, a menorandun
outlining the facts of the request was prepared for
approval of ‘Mr. Hoover, or Mr. Tolson, the Associate
Director. Subsequently, the mororandun was filed in
the Assistant Director's office under a "Do Not Pile"
procedure, and thereafter destroyed. In the field
office, the SAC maintained a record of approval as a
control device in his office safe. At the next yearly
field office inspection, a review of these records vould
be made by the Inspector to insure that the SAC was not
acting without prior FBINQ anproval in conducting
surreptitious entries. Upon completion of this review,
these records were destroyed.

Shore is no central index, file, or document
listing surreptitious entries conducted against domstic
targets. To reconstruct these activities, it is necessary
to rely upon recollections of Special Agents who have
knowledge of such activities, and review of those files
identified by recollection as boing targets of surreptitious
entries. Since policies and procedures followed in reporting
of information resulting fron a surreptitious entry were
designed to conceal the activity from persons not having a
need to know, information contained in FBI files relating
to entries is in most instances incompleto and difficult
to identify.

Reconstruction of instances of surreptitious ontry
through review of files and recollections of Spocial Agent
personnel at FBINO who have knowledge of such activities,
show the following targets and the approximate number of
entries conducted against each:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR
OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Re: Surreptitious Entries

a) ;

It is my understanding that the Senate Select - —
Committee on domestic intelligence activities has réquesté
“and received a number of documents from the Bureau. I am
also advised that you are maintaining duplicate copies of
these documents in an orderly form appropriately indexed.

I believe it is essential that the attorneys from
this Division who are assigned to the Division's inquiry
into surreptitious entries examine all documents which
have been furnished to the Senate Committee in order
that we may be aware of the information in possession
of the committee and also that we may be fully informed
as to the nature and extent of the Bureau's use of
surreptitious entries.

I have asked these attorneys to contact you t
arrange for a review of these documents, ~ .

Thank you very much for your continued cooperation

in his matter. CaN 7 = =

Assistant Director, Legal Counsel Division, Federal Bureau of :
Investigation, dated September 19, 1975, captioned "Deputy
Attorney General's Request for Materials. Lt

The aforementioned memorandum requests delivery to
Mr. Shaheen's office of original Bureau documents so that the
documents could be reviewed by the Deputy Attorney General.
The documents relate to the Bureau's investigation and use of
electronic surveillance on Martin Luther King, Jr. They par-
ticularly refer to former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach's
authorization for the electronic surveillance of King.

Assistant Director Mintz suggested to Mr. Shaheen on
9/19/75 that since these documents are originals in line with
Bureau policy an Agent .would hand carry them to the Deputy
Attorney General's office when he desired to review the same
and that the Agent would retain possession of same. This was
agreeable to Mr. Shaheen and arrangements. have been made for
a representative of the Legal Counsel Division to make these
documents available to the Deputy Attorney General when
requested.

Request number 233 was mentioned in a memorandum concerning
results from the/Hunter Mail program) which was dated

CONFIDENTIAL

US Senate Select Committee On
Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Mr. Dick asked SA Flynn if in the late 1950s and
early 1960s SA Flynn was involved in a program of intercepting
and opening mail for the FBI called "Z" coverage. SA Flynn
answered in the affirmative.

Mr. Dick asked seyeral questions as to how and who
set up the program of "Z" coverage. SA Flynn replied that he
had no information as to who set it up or how it was set up.

SA Flynn said that it is his current recollection that he was
told that it was instigated at the highest levels in Washington,
D.C. It was also his impression that someone from FBI head-
quarters came to New York and contacted the Chief Postal
Inspector in New York. And in turn someone from the New York
office contacted the Postmaster of the Lenox Hill Post Office.

SA Flynn was asked if he ever saw a document
authorizing "Z" coverage. SA Flynn replied in the negative.

SA Flynn was asked who his superior was who asked
him to participate in the "Z" coverage program. SA Flynn
replied that it was his supervisor, Arnold Brandt. SA Flynn
was asked who Arnold Brandt reported to and SA Flynn replied
that Brandt reported to SAC Joseph Schmidt.

SA Flynn was asked the purpose of "Z" coverage and he
replied that it was designed to uncover illegal intelligence
agents in the U.S. 7

In reply to a direct question asked by Mr. DickgSA
Flynn stated that the "Z" coverage entailed the intercepting of
mail to various diplomatic establishments that received mail
through the Lenox Hill Post Office, faking that mail back to
the New York Office (NYO), opening’ and photographing same and
returning the mail to the Lenox Hill Post Office prior to 8:00 AM
so that the mail could be delivered without any interruption in
the postal service.

SA Flynn declined to state what diplomatic establish-
ments were involved. However, when asked if he had ever seen

CONF: IAL

os oe @ e

fo” Tel CONFIBENTIAT

US Senate Select Committee On
Intelligence Activities (SSC)

any Soviet or Cuban mail,SA Flynn replied in the affirmative.

SA Flynn was asked who at the Lenox Hill Post Office
made the mail available to him. SA Flynn furnished the name
of two postmasters James Mc Gail (phonetic) and Joseph Bartlett.
SA Flynn abo stated that there were several foremen at the
post office with whom he dealt over the period of two or to
and a half years, but he could not recall their names.

SA Flynn was asked if the postal employees knew that
the mail furnished to the FBI was being opened. SA Flynn replied
that to his knowledge none of the postal employees were told
what was being done with the mail at the NYO.

In response to direct questions SA Flynn stated that
one of the agents handling "Z" coverage would go to the Lenox
Hill Post Office prior to 6:00 AM where a postal employee would
give him the mail for various diplomatic establishments. This
mail would be reviewed and some pieces of mail selected and taken
to the NYO where it was opened, photographed and resealed and
returned to the Lenox Hill Post Office. :

Mr. Dick asked what criteria was used to select
the pieces of mail to be opened. SA Flynn stated that all
United Nations mail and obvious business mail was not taken.
The pieces of mail selected were pieces that appeared to be
from individuals in the U.S. Particularly those with type-
written return addresses. 7

Mr. Dick asked if any mail from prominent people
or politicans was opened, SA Flynn stated that he has no
recollection of ever seeing any mail from prominent people
or politicians, and if he had it would not be selected for
opening as the program was designed to uncover illegal
intelligence agents.

Mr. Dick asked what the disposition of the photo-
graphs and negatives were. SA Flynn stated that the photo-
graphs were routed to the appropriate supervisor and the neg-
atives were filed in date order in a cabinet in the room where

the mail was processed. In response to a direct question
SA Flynn stated that he has no information as to the present
location of the negatives in question.

Mr. Dick asked if the program was successful and
SA Flynn replied that it was. He asked a question as to how
many cases were opened on the basis of "Z" coverage or how
many illegal intelligence agents were uncovered and SA Flynn
refused to answer because of the possibility that the answer
may involve some pending cases.

Mr. Dick asked what was the volume of mail opened.
SA Flynn said that a rough guess would be between 35 and 60
per day.

SA Flynn was asked who he worked with on "Z" coverage.
SA Flynn stated that he worked with SA Francis Dwyer for a time
and later with John F, Curran.

SA Flynn in response to a direct question explained
to Mr. Dick the technique of opening mail.

Mr. Dick asked SA Flynn how he got his training in
opening mail. SA Flynn stated that at the inception of "z"
coverage two unrecalled individuals from the FBI Laboratory
came to New York with the equipment used and trained SA Flynn
in the technique. Mr. Dick asked who else was trained at that

-time. SA Flynn stated that to the best of his recollection
there was SA Joseph Ashooh (phonetic), SA Francis Dwyer and
SA David Evans. The training lasted a day or two.

Mr. Dick also asked if SA Flynn ever opened mail for
the SAM and GUS surveys. SA Flynn stated that he did on an
irregular basis. In response to a direct question SA Flynn

stated that that the SAM survey mail was acquired at Kennedy

Airport. SA Flynn stated that he did not know what criteria
was used in selecting this mail nor for what purposes. SA Flynn
stated that he did not know where GUS survey mail was acquired
nor did he know for what purpose.

Mr. Dick then asked what knowledge SA Flynn had
of the SUN survey. SA FLYNN replied that he recalls hearing
the name, but knows nothing further about it. —

Mr. Dick asked SA Flynn if he ever had a case in
which he requested a mail cover, SA Flynn replied that he was
not cleared to discuss mail covers with the committee.

Mr. Dick asked SA Flynn if he conferred with SA
Paul Daly of the FBI prior to the interview and what was
discussed. SA Flynn replied in the affirmative and stated
that only ' procedural matters were discussed.

cole MITTEE ON CIVIL AND CONSTITUTIONAL- RIGHTS
: 7 + »THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

Disposal of Records:

At the outset, we note the disposal of records is
governed by Statute (Title 44, United States Code, Chapter
33) and Regulation (Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations,
Subpart 101-11.4). In addition, the Administrator of General
Services is directed by statute to “establish standards for
the selective retention ef records of continuing value..."
(Title 44, United States Code, Section 2905). On Septem-
ber 22, 1969, following a survey of the records management
j program of the United States Department of Justice which
% included the FBI, the National Archives and Records Service
(NARS) created a records retention plan for the FBI. This
oe plan designated records that have enduring Archival value

and which cannot be destroyed. WARS noted that "ordinarily
the records of a Federal agency that are worthy of permanent
retention amount to a rather small percentage of the total
volume of records generated. Many of the records produced
by the Federal] Burcau of Investigation, however, relate to
a number of controversial if not important aspects of the
history of the United States, particularly to the role of
the Federal Government in its relation to its citizens."
"fo be sire, many years will pass before these records can
be made available to the public for historical and other
serious research, Nevertheless, the Archival value of

these records will not decrease nor will interest in them
dissipate."

! Those records not designated for permanent reten-
tion under the Records Retention Plan may be destroyed when
they have served their purpose. Under Section 3303, Title 44,
United States Code, NARS approval must be secured, however,
for their destruction. Age of information in FBI files
covers a relatively short span of years. FBI had very few
{ files until the President in 1939, directed the FBI to be 7
responsible for the internal security of the United States.
In view of this and as the number of violations of law over
which the FBI has jurisdiction has nearly doubled since 1939,
the vast majority of FBI files has been created since 1939,
thus, giving them a contemporary value.

i The FBI does, however, have an active program to

“PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO
Bs 7 AUTHORIZE UNUSUAL INVISTIGATIVE
TECHNIQUES IN TORFIGN INTELLIGFNCR
INVESTIGATIONS

‘ ot 1 : The responsibility to protect the territorial
: and institutional integrity of the United States falls
squarely upon the shoulders of the. Federal Government.
fo effectively fulfill this responsibility, the agli
Government must acquire information to reach intelligent

decisions in the field of foreign affairs. This

information is also of vital importance when countering

the activities of foreign powers and their agents in the

United States.

With regard to efforts to obtain this
information, we should inquire whether the President,
acting through the Attorney General, may authorize
an agency of the Federal Government to utilize
{ unusual investigative ‘techniques such as wiretaps,
microphones and surreptitious entries without a
court order. The resolution of this question requires
consideration of the relationship between Presidential
power and national security on the one hand, and
the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment on

the other. Let us look at the two sides of this

relationship.

PRESIDENTIAL POWER
AND NATIONAL SECURITY

Alexander Hamilton wrote that men could
differ regarding the creation of a Federal Government,
but that once such a Government was created and
made responsible for the defense of the nation, it
must be given the authority necessary to discharge
that responsibility. Hamilton recognized that
"the circumstances that endanger the safety of
nations are infinite," and for this reason, he wrote,
no limits should be placed on the Government's
authority in this area. The Federalist, No. 23
(Hl. Lodge ed. 1888) at 123. ;

Numerous decisions of the United States
Supreme Court, moreover, have indicated that the
President, as Chief Executive, possesses powers
in foreign and military affairs which are not
dependent on a specific legislative grant, but
derive from the Constitution itself. These
decisions have also indicated that the Court ‘holds
great respect for these powers and that only with

extreme care will it interfere with them.



In Marbury'v. Madison, 1 Cranch (5 U.S.)
137 (1803), the Court commented: "By the
Constitution . . . the President is invested with
certain political powers, in the exercise ‘of which
he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable

only to his country in his political character, and

c to his own conscience." Id. at 165-166. In 1863,
‘ the Supreme Court in the Prize Cases, 67 U.S.
{2 Black) 635, went on to uphold the President's

autherity to blockade insurrectionary Southern

ports without Corigressional authorization. In

1915, the Supreme Court, in Mackenzie v. Hare,
a 239 U.S. 299, explained that the Federal judiciary
should be slow to curtail such powers.

In United States v. Curtiss-Wright -

Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, decided by the Supreme
i : Court in 1936, the Court again commented upon the
: President's powers in the area of foreign affairs.
The Court explained that there is a significant
difference between the conduct of domestic, as -
opposed to foreign affairs, and stated that the
Government's powers in the aréa of internal affairs
are limited to those specifically enumerated in the

i Constitution. In the area of foreign affairs,

eee e e
i 4 however, the powers Of the Government are not
Limited to those set forth in the Constitution.
If riot expressly set forth in that document, the
Court wrote, the Government, as ian attribute of
sovereignty, would still have the power "to declare
and wage war" and "to maintain diplomatic relations."
Id. at 318,

The Court in Curtiss-Wright, discussing
the sensitive nature of foreign diplomacy and the

need for secrecy, wrote that, if the nation is to

be successful in its foreign relations, the executive

branch must be afforded greater flexibility than it

is permitted in the area of domestic affairs. The
. President, not Congress, the Court reasoned, is in

a better position to be knowledgeable ‘regarding

conditions in foreign countries. "Secrecy in
respect of information gathered by [Presidential
sources and agents] may be highly necessary, and

the premature disclosure of it productive of harmful
results." Id. at 320.

The Supreme Court in Hirabayashi v.
United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), went on to

state that the President's "war power" is "the

power to wage war successfully" and held that the

NW 55256 Docld:32989667 Page 206 cane . .



yt 7 1
power extended “to every matter and activity so
related to war as substantially to affect its credit
i and progress." The Court went:on to say that the
Constitution has given to the president great
latitude in determining the nature and extent of

the danger to the nation and the means to resist it.

Regarding the judiciary's*tole in this area, the

t Court again emphasized that it would interfere with
the President's power in this area only with extreme
care, Id. at 93.

In 1948, the Supreme Court in Chicago and

Southern Airlines, Inc. v. Waterman Corp., 333°U.S.

103, reaffirmed and elaborated on its earlier holding

. in Curtiss-Wright. The Court in Waterman again
held that the President is empowered to act with
broad freedom and secrecy in the conduct of foreign
+ . relations and that the judiciary should not interfere
with Presidential power in this area. Commenting on

the sensitive nature of foreign affairs and the

: judiciary's role in this avea, the Court said:

e e
: A "The President . . . has available
: intelligence services whose reports

are not and ought not to be published
to the world. It would be intolerable
that courts without the, relevant
information should review and perhaps
nullify actions of the Fxecutive
taken on information properly held
secret. Nor can courts sit in_camera
in order to be taken into executive
confidences. But even if courts
could acquire Zuil.disclosure, the
very nature of executive decisions
as to foreign poiicy is political,
not judicial. Such decisions are
wholly confided by our Constitution
to the political department ...
They are delicate, complex and
involve large elements of prophecy
» . . They are decisions of a kind
for which the Judiciary has neither
aptitude, facilities, nor responsi-

. bilities and which has long been held
to belong in the domain of political
power not subject to judicial
intrusion or inquiry ...." Id.
at lll. ices

The Congress has also recognized that the
President has certain powers in the area of foreign

affairs. Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and

Safe Streets Act, 18 United States Code, Sections 2510-
2520, authorizes the use of electronic surveillance
for certain crimes. Along with the surveillance

provisions in the Act, there is the following proviso:

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 208 sans a iu

power, to obtain foreign intelligence
information deemed essential to
the security of the United States,

{ or to protect national.security
information “agai

telligence activities." 18 United

States Code, Section 2511(3).

THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT
Beyond the question of Presidential power
and national security an additional consideration

in this area is the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution,

which specifies:

"The right .of the people to
be sécure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against un-
reasonable searches and seizures,
shall not be violated, and no |
Warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by
Oath or affirmation, and parti-
cularly describing the place
‘ to be searched, and the persons

or things to be seized."

The question is teadsed::.Pees the Fourth Amendment's
warrant requirement prohibit the President, acting

without a court order, from authorizing an agency of

to 7 ”
ice. the Led Government to utilize alectronic
surveillances and .physical entries in the foreign
intelligence areca? ;

By way of background, prior to 1967, the
Supreme Court decided the legality of electronic
surveillance by determining whether or not a trespass
was involved; the Fourth Amendment was violated only
if at the time of the installation there was a trespass
on the premises. With the Katz case in 1967, however,
(389 U.S. 347) the Court stated the Fourth Amendment

protects people, not places, and abolished the

i ‘ : trespassory distinction. It held that oral communications
were protected from unreasonable surveillance by the
Fourth Amendment and that the mandate of this Amendment
required adherence to judicial process.

Intentionally left open in Katz was the

question of whether safeguards other than prior

authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourth

{ Amendment in a situation involving national security.

: The issue unresolved in Katz was partially faced by the
Supreme Court in the Keith decision, 407 U.S, 297
(1972). There the Supreme Court held that electronic
surveillances in the domestic security area conducted

“solely within the discretion of the Executive violated

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 210



e

the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The

Court emphasized the case involved only the, domestic

aspects of national sécurity. "We have not addressed,
and express no opinion as to, the ‘issues which may be
involved with respect to activities of foreign powers

or their agents." 407 U.S. at 321, 322.

‘ Thus, the Supreme Court reserved judgment
relative to the question of whether a warrantless

electronic surveillance directed against foreign powers

{

|

; violated the Fourth Amendment. Every lower Federal

i court that has faced the question, however, has stated
the President may constitutionally authorize warrantless
‘ wiretaps when foreign powers are involved. United States
ve. Clay, 430 F. 2d 165 (5th Cir. 1970); United States

v. Brown, 484 F, 2a 418 (5th Cir. 1973); United States

v. Butenko, 494 F, 2a 593 (3d Cir. 1974); Zweibon

v. Mitchell, 363 F. Supp. 936 (D.D.C. 1973).

j in United States v. Brown, the Court commented,

“Restrictions upon the President's power. which are
appropriate in cases of domestic security become

artificial in the context of the international sphere .. ..
{A] thread . . . runs through the Federalist Papers:

that the President must take care to safequard the

oy re a
eo: a @
Seer nation from possibile foreign encroachment, whether
in its existence as a nation or in its intercourse’
with other nations." 484 F 2d at 426.
We may then inquire whether the President
has the authority to authorize a warrantless physical

entry directed against foreign powers. In United States

v. Ehrlichman, 376 F. Supp. 29 (D.D.C. 1974), a

eximinal prosecutian for conspiring to violate Title 18,

United States Code, Section 241, and thus injure a

citizen in the enjoyment of Fourth Amendment rights,

the Special Prosecutor asserted that the President,

acting through the Attorney General, does not have the
authority to authorize the installation of a warrantless,
trespassory microphone. The court agreed. It reasoned
that the President does not have the authority to

suspend the requirement of the Fourth Amendment and

stated that the Government must comply with strict

constitutional limitations an trespassory searches even

when known foreign agents are involved. Id. at 33.
But these comments, while they should be

given consideration, do not declare a conclusion of

law reached by the court as to the legal effect of the

facts revealed. They are dictum, merely the opinions

of one judge. in fact, no court has held that the

NW 55256 Docld:32989667 Page 212 ~ ease iaEuueS



President may not authorize a surreptitious entry
directed against foreign powers. Thus, in our view
the question is an open one, and we feel that a

strong argument can be made supporting the President's
authority in this area.

Note that the Fourth Amendment is concerned
with searches and seizures, not trespasses per se and
that both the interception of oral communications and
a surreptitious entry constitute significant intrusions
upon interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. Thus,
if the President has the authority to authorize warrantless
electronic surveillance against foreign powers it would
appear that he could constitutionally authorize a
surreptitious entry against foreign powers. Of course,

the court in United States v. Ehrlichman, supra,

commenting on recent lower Federal court ‘cases which
stated the President may constitutionally authorize
warrantless electronic surveillance against foreign
powers, characterized wiretapping as a “relatively
nonobtrusive search." 376 F. Supp. at 33. But
wiretapping is an intrusion that can last for an
indefinite period and is all-pervasive, while the

intrusion connected with a physical entry is of

NW 55256 Docld:32989667 Page 213

ee ee eee



NW 55256
LL

e - e@
relatively short duration and ‘is usually directed
toward.a specific objective. Thus, it would appear
that where the objective of an entry is simply to
create the circumstances for monitoring it is
actually less obtrusive than wiretapping. Where
the objective of the entry is to conduct a physical
search the gap may be narrower and depending
on the circumstances may approach wiretapping
in obtrusiveness.
CONCLUSION

Numerous decisions of the United States
Supreme Court have recognized that the President,
as Chief Executive, possesses powers in foreign
and military affairs which are not dependent on a
specific legislative grant but which derive from
the Constitution itself. Every lower Federal court
that has faced the question has stated the President
may constitutionally authorize warrantless wiretaps
when foreign powers are involved. In a recent Fifth
Circuit case, for example, the court commented,
"Restrictions upon the President's power which are
appropriate in cases of domestic security become
artificial in the context of the international

sphere." No court has held that the President

a Federal agency to utilize unusual investigative

techniques in foreign intelligence investigations.

I, suzject: ACCESS TO RECORDS MAINTAINED
: BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS

: Re SAC Mermorandum 5~72 dated 6/13/72, and Bureau letter
i- to Albany, and all field offices, dated-8/14/72, captioned as above.

The following discussion is being offered to inform thé field

i of recent legal trends which may affect our investigative efforts when

: access to banking records is contemplated. The general thrust of
referenced communications was that no constitutional inhibitions existed
to prohibit reasonable inspections of financial records by the Government
and that usually no subpoena was necessary. Subsequent challenges to
this position on First and Fifth Amendment grounds have been rejected
by the courts. However, several recent lower court decisions indicate
that a judicial reexamination of this area in light of a changing inter-
pretation of the Fourth Amendment may be developing, As will ba seen,
the Supreme Court has not yet furnished a definitive statement of its
views on the matter.

A 1973 decision in the Second Circuit addressed itself to

First Amendment problems surrounding this issue of governmental
access to bank records, Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee v.
Gray, 480 F.2d 326 (2d Cir, 1973), cert. dénied 415 U.S. 948 (1973),

: was a case in which antiwar demonstrators claimed FBI review of

1 their organization's bank records had a chilling effect on the exercise

: of their First Amendment rights. The court, however, affirmed the
dismissal of the complaint and held that the plaintiffs failed to present
a justiciable controversy as they could show no specific harm, real or
threatened, from the FBI Agent's warrantless inspection of the account,

it should be noted, however, that there was a vigorous dissent in this
case and perhaps a contrary holding would have been reached had the
plaintiffs been able to prove a real or potential injury resulting from
the FBI's activity.

aoe : A recent Supreme Court decision seems to dispose of any

: Fifth Amendment barrier. Couch v. United States, 409 U.S. 322 (1973),
ra involved an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) summons directed to the
(gees defendant's accountant ordering him to furnish the Government the

uy defendant's business records which the accountant possessed. Defendant
1 intervened invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-

1 incrimination. In affirming the validity of the district court's order

: enforcing the summons, the Supreme Court held that the defendant's
Fifth Amendment rights were not violated even though she owned the
documents sought by the Government. The Fifth Amendment only
protects a defendant from being ". . . compelled in any criminal

case to be a witness against himself... .'' Here the compuision

was on the accountant, not the defendant, and the Fifth Amendment

dees not proscribe incriminating statements elicited from another.

‘The analogy to bank records would seem to be that if the Government
required a bank to produce a depositor's records, the depositor could
not raise a Fifth Amendment objection inasmuch as the compulsion"

to produce the records would be on the bank, not the depositor.

: With regard to Fourth Amendment concerns, the referenced
communications suggested that subpoenas or cther judicial processes
were unnecessary as a depositor was considered to have no proprietary
interest in the bank records and thus had no standing to object on Fourth
Amendment grounds. Once a check was honored at a bank it became the
- bank's property and the defendant lost all legal interest in it. United
States v. Gerhart, 275 F. Supp. 443 (S.D.W. Va. 1967); United States v,
Gross, 416 F.2d 1205 (8th Cir. 1969). The property theory of Fourth
Amendment protection, however, was expressly abandoned by the
Supreme Court in 1967 in its landmark decision of Katz v. United States,
389 U.S, 347. Katz, quoting Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 304
(1967), held that the ". . . premise that property interests control
| the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited."
| 389 U.S. 347, 353. Rather, ". . . the Fourth Amendment protects
people, not places."' 389 U.S. 347, 351. The Government may conduct
an wareasonable search if it invades an area in which a defendant has a

justifiable expectation of privacy, regardless of whether he maintains a
property interest in the area searched or item seized. '. . . (W)hat he
seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public ©
may be constitutionally protected." 389 U.S. 347, 351, 352.

The constitutional issues, then, are twofold: i) Does a
depositor have a justifiable expectation of privacy in bank records
pertaining to his account, making’ an inspection of those records by.
jaw enforcement personnel a search" within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment? And 2), if he does, is a judicial order, i.e., subpoena,
summons, or search warrant required to make the search reasonable?

Several recent state and Federal decisions have addressed
themselves, either directly or indirectly, to these issues. The latest
is Burrows v. Superior Court, 16 Cri. 2320 (Cal. Sup..Ct. 12/27/74).

Burrows, an attorney, was suspected by local authorities of
misappropriating the funds of a client. Several California banks in which
he maintained accounts were contacted by a detective resulting in at least
one bank giving the officer photocopies of defendant's bank statements.
The defendant sought to suppress the damaging evidence contained in
the bank reccrds on the ground it was obtained in’violation of the search
and seizure clause of the California constitution, the wording of which
is substantially the same as that found inthe Fourth Amendment. The
California Supreme Court ruled that Burrows helda". . . reasonable
expectation. . . that, absent compulsion by iegal process, the matters
he reveals to the bank will be utilized by the bank only for internal
banking purposes," Id, at 2320, Lacking a subpoena, warrant, or
other form.of legal process, the seizure of the bank statements was
unreasonable and the state was prohibited from using them at the
defendant's trial.

Several important principles are evident from a reading of
this decision. First, the holding rests not on an interpretation of the
Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution but rather upon the
search and seizure ciause (article I, section 13) of the constitution of
the State of California, This means that bank records abtained without
legal process may be excluded only in state prosecuticns, not Federal

cases. A state court's construction of its own state constitution is not
j binding on the action of Federal officers whose conduct is measured
\' against the salient provisions of the Federal Constitution. Thus, absent
H a Federal decision to the contrary, an FBI Agent may obtain, without
benefit of subpoena, information from a suspect's bank account in
California and legally have it introduced into evidence at a criminal
trial conducted ina U. 8, District Court in California. Nevertheless,
‘ the practical impact of this decision on the Bureau's investigative ,

{ activities in that state is potentially great. It is foreseeable that a

: bank, which could not furnish depositor information to state officials

i without a valid judicial order, would be highly reluctant to give the
i same information to the officials' Federal counterparts who possessed
no subpoena or warrant regardless of the fact that the Federal agents
were under no legal obligation to have obtained one.

Because of the strong likelihood that Agents in California who
, are working cases which necessitate examination of banking records wili
be met by requests for subpoenas, it is suggested that they familiarize
themselves with the provisions of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
rule 17(c), which governs the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum.

A second important principle reflected in the Burrows decision
concerns the scope of protection the court afforded the depositor under:
a the aegis of his justifiable expectation of privacy. The case held that
‘ not only was a judicial order required to obtain copies of documents
furnished the bank by the depositor, i.e., checks, deposit slips, etc.,
but also for the production cf bank statements prepared by the financial
institution itself and intended primarily for use by the bank. ''Thus, we
hold petitioner had a reasonable expectation that the bank would maintain
j the confidentiality of those papers which originated with him in check
form and of the bank statements into which a record oi those same checks
‘ had been transformed pursuant to internal bank practice." Burrows,
7 supra, at 2320, 2321. Although the decision only concerned bank
af statements, it seems a logical extension of the court's reasoning to
apply the 'justifiabie expectation of privacy" theory to signature cards
and other written instruments prepared by a depositor in order to utilize
the services of the bank. In addition, the practice of law enforcement
officials of routinely contacting banks when investigating nonsufficient

fund checks will have to be curtailed unless a subpcena or other form
of legal process is obtained. The court also indicated it was prepared
to extend the protection to bonds, loan applications, loan guarantees,
and other papers utilized by a bank customer in conducting his financial
affairs. “

As the court itself phrased the issue, the decision is limited
to a consideration of whether deféndant's rights were violated". . . ‘in
obtaining, without benefit of legal process, copies of statements from
a bank in which he maintained an account," Id. at 2320, (emphasis
added). It would appear, then, that no legal restriction exists to a
review of records relevant to proving a criminal violation on a
defendant if he does not maintain an account at the bank where the
records are reviewed. Examples would be examining suspicious
checks drawn on another institution and presented to such a bank for
cashing by a suspect or checking stolen money orders already cashed
by a suspect and being held by the issuing bank. In addition, the
exclusionary principle of the Burrows case apparently applies only
to official Government conduct, not to inquiries by private entities
such as department stores, etc.

A third significant aspect of the decision is the court's
rejection of traditional warrant exceptions to sustain the search.
Specifically, consent by the bank could not make the search legal.

‘fhe voluntary relinquishment of sucn records by the bank at the
request of the police does not constitute a valid consent by this
petitioner." Id. at 2321. Arguably, consent from the depositor

himself would suffice. The thrust of the opinion, then, is that if

the officer seeking to review a depositor's bank records acts without

the benefit of legal process or the depositor's consent, his search of
those records is illegal under the California constitution and any seizure
of information is unreasonable rendering it inadmissible at a state trial.

Two other recent cases, one Federal and the other state,
furnish additional input on these issues. In United States v. Miller,
400 F.2d 751 (Sth Cir. 1974), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Fire-
arms (ATF) Agents investigated a case involving a nonregistered
still and possession of non-tax-paid whiskey. In furtherance of their

investigation they received subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney
which were used to obtain microfilm copies of the defendant's bank
checks. The checks were introduced at Miller's trial and he was
convicted. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit determined that the subpoenas
were improperly obtained in that they were issued by the United States
Attorney rather than by a court, there was no return made upon them
to the court, and they were issued for a date when the grand jury was
not in session. Obtaining the checks by use of the faulty subpoenas,
therefore, ". . . constituted an unlawful invasion of Miller's privacy,
and... any evidence so cbtained should have been stippressed,"

Yd, at 756,. Miller's conviction was reversed.

In Sheriff of Lander County v. Nevada National Bank, 518
P, 2d 602 (Nev. 1974), a county sheriff obtained a search warrant to
search the bank records of three depositors in connection with an
investigation of alleged misappropriation of county funds. The bank
was unwilling to comply with the warrant and sought to enjoin its
execution. The Supreme Court of Nevada affirmed the lower court's
order issuing the injunction and stated that the warrant was invalid
because it did not particularly describe the items sought and contained
insufficient probable cause. It authorized nothing more than a "fishing
expedition. " c

The significance of these decisions, especially the Miller
case, is apparent. They suggest that a depositor, at least in the
jurisdictions of these courts, enjoys Fourth Amendment protection
in his bank records and only a subpoena or warrant, properly issued,
will permit a law officer to make an inspection of them. Even if it is
ultimately determined that the Fourth Amendment affords no constitutional
protection to a depositor's bank records, if judicial process is invoked
to obtain financial information it must be used properly.

Other recent cases are contrary to the holdings discussed
above. For example, in Fifth Avene Peace Parade Committee v.
Gray, supra, the court noted "(the specific activity of... (fhe FBI
Agent)... by ne means rose to the level of a constitutional invasion
of privacy." 480 F.2d 326, 332. The issue has not yet been resolved
specifically by the Supreme Court. That Court has, however, held that
a bani itself cannot assert the Fourth Amendment when attempting to

evade a proper legal semmons for the financial records of a depositor
under investigation, First National Bank v. United States, 267 U.S.
576 (1925); and that a depositor suffers no Fourth Amendment violation
when a bank produces information from his account pursuant to a
lawfully issued summons. Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517
(1971), But the question of the assertion of that right by a depositor
when no legal process has been obtained is still open. Some insight
ean be gained by a brief review of California Bankers Association v.
Shultz, 39 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1974), in which the court upheld the consti-
tationality of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, (12 USCS 88 1829b, 1'730d,
1951-1959; 31 USCS 88 1051-1122), ~

The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 was passed following a
congressional determination that foreign and domestic bank records

‘ of custemers thought to be engaged in illegal activities were generally

unavailable. Its purpose was to obtain financial information having

"a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations
or proceedings, '' The Act and the implementing regulations of the
Secretary of the Treasury require banks to maintain recards of their
customers' identities, to keep copies of checks, and record certain
other items. In addition to these recordkeeping duties the reporting
provisions require that the banks file a report with the IRS on each
domestic transaction involving currency exceeding $10,000. That
report is to include the identity of the person conducting the transaction,
of the person for whom it was conducted, and a description of the
transaction,

In Shultz, the court saw no Fourth Amendment violation in
the recordkeeping provision. The Act does not require the banks to
furnish the information io the Government, only to maintain it. "(B)oth
the legisiative history and the regulations make specific reference to the
fact that access to the records is to be controlled by existing legal
process." 39 L. Ed, 2d 812, 835 (emphasis added). The clear inference .
of this passage is that if the Government desires to obtain information
from banks that they are required to maintain under the Act, (customer's
identity, copies of checks, etc.) it must conform to "existing legal
process."' "Legal process" would appear to mean a judicial order,

~JTu

Re: Access to, Records Maintained
By Banking Institutions

subpoena, summons, etc. It would be only speculation to assert that legal °
process is not required to obtain other financial information not required
to be maintained under the Act.

A review of the legislative history of the Bank Secrecy Act,
P.L, 91-508, referred to by the court, reveals that it was the intention
of the drafters that the records required to be maintained would be _
confidential. With regard to the recordkeeping provisions, the congres-
sional finding was that "there is nothing in this bill which would make
such records any more accessible to law enforcement officers. . . than
they now are."' 2 U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News 4400, 1970. Again,
with reference to these provisions, the legislative history states that
the records ". . . will not be made automatically available for law
enforcement purposes. They can only be obtained through existing
legal process." 2 U.S. Code Cong. and Ad, News, supra, p. 4395.

With regard to the domestic reporting provisions of the Act,
the court held that the banks suffered no Fourth Amendment violation
but did not reach this issue with respect to the depositors. Because
none of the depositor plaintiffs in Shultz engaged in transactions involving
move than $10,000 in currency (the only transactions banks are required
to report) they lacked standing to challenge the reporting regulations on
Fourth Amendment grounds. Thus the crucial issue of whether a depositor
can challenge the Government's warrantless inspection of his financial
records as being violative of his Fourth Amendment rights was specifically
left open ky the Supreme Court. The Court's recent decision in United ‘
States v. Bisceglia, 43 L.W. 4242 (2/18/75), does nothing to resolve
this issue. Bisceglia merely involved an interpretation of a Federal
statute which empowers IRS Agents to issue administrative summonses
for records (in this case, bank records) which might aid in determining
an individual's tax liability. That procedure, which the court upheld,
was objected to by the bank, not a depositor, and did not present
constitutional consideraticns.

Another potential factor affecting the Bureau's work in this
area is H.R. 1005, a bill entitied "Right to Financial Privacy Act of
1975," introduced ‘into the House of Repyesentatives on 1/14/75. This
bill, if passed, would recognize a confidential relationship between a
depositor and a banking institution and permit access to the financial

Re: Access to Records Maintained

records by law enforcement in one of only four ways. Consent of the
depositor, good for three months, would be permitted, as would an
administrative summons cr subpoena, a judiciai subpoena, or search
warrant. Concerning the latter three, both the bank and the customer
would be served, with the provision that the depositor could move to .
quash the subpoena or enjoin execution of the warrant. The ultimate
fate of the bill, of course, is unknown at this time; however, it should
be observed that at least five othér similar bills were introduced into
Congress in 1972-1973 and none have yet been enacted.

It is foreseeable then, that because of the legislative history
of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Supreme Court's discussion in the
Shultz case of that history, pending legislation in Congress, and the
recent trend of the lower courts, it is likely the Bureau will be
confronted with more frequent requests for subpoenas when seeking
review of bank depositors' accounts. Because of this distinct
possibility, a brief review of procedures governing the Bureau's
q access to records subpoenaed by a Federal grand jury seems
pertinent.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 (e) prohibits disclosure of matters

occurring before the grand jury and maintains that its proceedings
are secret, This raises the question of the Bureau's access to records
subpoenaed by that body. Concerning this issue the courts have held
that "when the docurnent sought is sought for itself independently rather
than because it was displayed to the grand jury, there is no bar of
secrecy, '' Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,
211 F. Supp. 729, 734 (N.D. Til 1962), and that Rule 6 (e)". . . is
: intended only to protect against disclosure of what is said or what
: takes place in the grand jury room." United States v. Interstate
t Press Carriers, Inc., 280 F.2d 52, 54 (@d Cir. 1960). It would seem,
then, that the secrecy intended by Rule 6 (e) would not bar FBI review
of subpoenaed grand jury documents. Many jurisdictions, however,
require that the United States Attorney obtain an order from the district
court judge directing him to make the subpoenaed documents available
to the investigative agency before they will be released. See United

tates v. Interstate Press Carriers, Inc., supra; in Re July 1973 Grand
Jury, 374 F. Supp., 1534 (N.D. i. 1973). “Agents having matters which
involve reviews of subpoenaed bank records should consult with the

Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Republican Leader Hugh Scoit /
advised of the Senate's investigation and study of Government operations .
with respect to intelligence’ activities. Senators Mansfield and Scott
requested the Bureau not to destroy, remove from our possession or

documents which might have a bearing on subjects under investigation

by the Senate, Accordingly, pending further clarification, the Identifica-
tion Division ceased all previously approved records management finger-
print destruction programs. These fingerprint destruction programs,
previously approved by the Archivist of the United States, related to the
destruction of civil fingerprint cards of persons 75 years of age and older
and criminal fingerprint cards of persons 80 years of age and older.

Purpose of this memorandum is to request that Office of
Congressional Affairs, Legal Counsel Division, through appropriate
contact in the United States Senate determine if the above request
contained in Ietier of 1/27/75, was intended to include the records

By way of background, with the coucurrence of the Attorney

States, in 1970 we began a long-term project to consolidate and purge the
civil fingerprint file. This project has been programmed into three phases
in order to utilize employees with varying experience ranging from
relatively new employees to those fully qualified to classify and search
fingerprints. Phase I and Phase IU called for a review of civil fingerprint
cards to Tecate and destroy fingerprint cards received in connection with

In 1973, with the approval of the Attorney General and the Archivist
of the United States we instituted a records management fingerprint purge
program to dispose of arrest fingerprint cards and related records
maintained by: the Identification Division on individuals 80 years of age and
older in accordance with Public Law 91-287. The Identification Division,
no longer retains arrest fingerprint cards of individuals meeting this age
criteria. Through this records management criminal fingerprint purge
program we have purged and destroyed more than 1, 500, 000 arrest
fingerprint cards and related name index cards.

These purge programs have been invaluable in gaining valuable
file space necessary to meet our growth demands in both the civil and
criminal fingerprint files. For example, current additions to our civil
fingerprint file exceed 1, 000, 000 fingerprint cards each year and more
than 2, 000, 000 fingerprint cards to our criminal fingerprint file each
year, Any fingerprint records system to remain cost effective, efficient
and viable and make maximum utilization of available manpower and
space must be purged of inactive records that serve no useful purpose.

The vital records management fingerprint purge programs in the civil

and criminal fingerprint files of the Identification Division have been held
in abeyance since receipt of the above letter dated 1/27/75 from Senators
Mansfield and Scott. It is imperative that these vital programs be resumed
as soon as possible, It would not appear that it was the intent of

Senators Mansfield and Scott to include our fingerprint purge programs

in their request as these records management fingerprint purge programs -
do not relate to intelligence activities,

Dear Mike:

t The enclosed documents relating to mail inter-

: cept programs are submitted for declassification by the
Départment of Justice and the FBI. Portions of these dochi-
ments which reveal sensitive sources or on-going operations
should be appropriately excised for use at public hearings.

A list of these documents is also attached.
Those documents which are followed by an asterisk on this
list do not appear to be classified, but are nonetheless
included because their contents are similar in nature to
those documents which are classified.

These documents should be declassified by
Tuesday, October 14, to allow sufficient preparation time
for the mail hearings, which are now scheduled to begin
on Tuesday, October 21.

Dear Mike:

Several of the documents supplied to the
Committee by the Bureau in connection with the Martin
Luther King matter contain the conclusionary statement
that at various times in 1962 and 1963, Stanley David
Levison was "a concealed member of the Communist Party
USA." Some examples of such documents are listed on
the attached sheet. I would appreciate your having the
Bureau supply the supporting evidence which existed for each
of those conclusions as of the date of the documents listed
or, where appropriate, as of the date cited in. the docu-
ment itself.

We have noted that one of the documents which
has been received appears to supply some indication of
how at least one of these conclusionary statements about
Levison was arrived at. That document is a memorandum from
the Director to the Attorney General, dated September 4,
1963, captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., Security Matter-C"
which contains the following statement:

A source who has furnished reliable information

in the past advised in July 1963, that Stanley

Levison is a secret member of the Communist

Party, USA (CPUSA), and contributes funds to
Fel @, CPUSA on a regular basis.

to that source. In addition, please advise whether the
source was "live" or electronic. If "live", the identity
need not he revealed. If electronic, please identify the

Re; SENSTUDY ~ 75

involved on the part of a Departmental Attorney who would
represent Bureau personnel, Mr. David J, Anderson, Civil
Division, discussed the proposed testimony with Shackelford
and Rachner and accompanied them.

Shackelford_and Rachner appeared as instructed at
3:00 p.m., 5/75, with Anderson, At approximately 3:30 p.m.,
Arthur Harrigan, staff member of the Committee, appeared at
the reception area and escorted us to a nearby former hotel
where the statements were to be taken, Present for taking
of the statement on behalf of the Committee were Harrigan,
Barbara Banoff, a recording machine operator and Mark
Gitenstein, A minority counsel representative, name
unrecalled, was also present for a short period,

Shackelford and Rachner were not placed under
oath; however, their rights were read to them and a waiver
was presented for signature, At this time, Anderson advised
he was present on behalf of the Government, not to represent
Shackelford and Rachner., Shackelford insisted the waiver
form so stipulate, as to limitation of counsel, which was
done, and waivers were signed,

Upon request, Rachner related the mechanics of the
Bureau's liaison with IRS and, specifically, means used to
obtain income tax forms,

Shackelford was asked to agree to the accuracy of
lengthy pasSages read from the various FBI documents in their
possession, which was done, Objections were raised by
Shackelford to this laborious and time-consuming process,
pointing out, with Anderson's concurrence, the FBI would
stipulate to the contents of the documents, Harrigan, after
considerable discussion, then agreed to try to summarize and
speed up the process, which was done. Documents involved
concerned: 1) Robert Marvin Shelton (Klan 1965); 2) Royal
Virgil Young, Sr., James R, Venable, Jason Edgar Kersey,
Calvin Fred Craig, Samuel Holloway Bowers, Jr., Robert Echols
Scoggins (Klan 1965); 3) Robert Marvin Shelton, United Klans
of America, Inc, (UKA), Alabama Rescue Service (alias of UKA)
(1970), Betty Mae Smith (CPUSA 1969), Bradford Bingham (CPUSA
1965), Sidney Morris Peck (SM 1968), and Edward R. Mull
(Klan 1970). There were numerous other COINTELPRO documents
in the package of documents which were not discussed.

Memorandum to Mr, W. R, Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY - 75

In terminating the interview, Gitenstein requested
that Shackelford and Rachner agree, on the record, to notify
the Committee 24 hours in advance of any additional infor-
mation which they might use in open testimony Tuesday, 9/30/75,
concerning the matters discussed. Shackelford told Gitenstein
this was an unreasonable and unfair request inasmuch as the
statement taken had been restricted to a recitation of our
liaison with IRS, the mechanics of obtaining tax returns and
virtually a statement of agreement as to the accuracy of
Harrigan's reading of the COINTELPRO documents, It was
explained there was no way of anticipating questions raised
and answers of necessity would inject new material by Bureau
personnel, Gitenstein then agreed to a proposal that Bureau
personnel would advise of any factual change desired as to
answers given in the course of the statement upon review of the
transcript. Rachner requested Gitenstein to agree to advise
the Bureau 24 hours in advance of hearing as to any new line
of questioning or specific inquiring outside of the statement
taken, to which Gitenstein agreed, Anderson concurred with
these agreements, Gitenstein advised Bureau personnel would
be expected to testify in open hearings Tuesday, 9/30/75,

OBSERVATIONS

Bearing in mind the hearings on 9/30/75 involve IRS,
it is expected testimony of Bureau personnel will be used in
an effort to establish methods used to obtain IRS income tax
returns under Section 6103 of IRS Code of 1954 and alleged
FBI misuse of this information for COINTELPRO purposes. FBI
documents in the possession of the Committee speak for then-
selves and are expected to constitute the primary effort of
the Committee regarding the FBI's relationship with IRS. It
can also be expected that comments will be solicited from
Bureau personnel as to the propriety of the various requests
and subsequent use of tax information,

The matter of being, afforded legal counsel by the
Department does not appear to/fully resolved and needs to be
firmed up, Shackelford and Rachner are not personally involved
here, no Departmental conflict exists, and they thought they
had personal legal counsel at their side until the deposition
began.

Select Committee concerning the Bureau's relationship with
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in preparation for testimony
on 9/30/75, This is to advise this segment of the IRS
hearings has been cancelled,

BACKGROUND

Referenced memorandum related an agreement
extracted from the staff that they would furnish 24 hours
in advance any new subject matter or line of inquiry intende
for utilization during scheduled hearings, During the
morning of 9/29/75 John T, Elliff, Director of the staff,
advised he intended .to inject the matter of the Bureau
having obtained Martin Luther King and Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) tax returns and suggested
(by Atlanta) Counterintelligence Program utilization of them.
He also advised he intended to broaden the inquiry into our
obtaining the tax returns of Sidney M, Peck to include his
being a Key Activist and relate this to the proposed Counter-
intelligence Program use of the tax returns,

It was vigorously pointed out to E1liff by personnel
trying to locate documents that would resolve whether woe

Memorandum to Mr, W. R, Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY - 75

suggested: counterintelligence usage of King's returns,
and those of SCLC, was implemented, it was a monumental
job to go through the extremely voluminous material

to accomplish this and certainly little time would remain
for their study by staff or Bureau personnel involved in
the hearings,

Shackelford also pointed out the injection of new
material was not within the 24-hour agreement, Elliff
stated he realized this but felt both issues raised would
be focal points of testimony because both persons were well
known. He added that in absence of the document disclosing
whether the proposed counterintelligence usage of King and
SCLC's returns was implemented, he would have reference made
to the fact they were requested and obtained, but the matter
would be dealt with during subsequent hearings,

Shackelford told Elliff this would be a totally
unfair presentation as to King as it would imply wrongdoing
without full discussion and background justification and
it left a clear implication the counterintelligence action
was taken, El1liff was told that if this course of action
was followed it would be vigorously protested during the
course of the hearings, as would his attempt to equate the
Key Activist Program with the Counterintelligence Program,
No agreement was reached,

Subsequently, Shackelford and Rachner met with
Mark Gitenstein of the staff to review the transcript of
their deposition, Gitenstein engaged Shackelford in dis-
cussion concerning the previous conversation with E1liff,
Gitenstein was advised of the factual reasons for the strong
objections of Shackelford and that if they chose to proceed,
vigorous objections would be raised during the open hearings
by Shackelford, Gitenstein said he would try to have the
matter of Peck's being a Key Activist covered in the initial
comments being prepared for Senator Joseph M. Montoya (N. M.)
without counterintelligence connotations, He was advised im
Peck's previous status as a Key Activist was not relative
to the IRS hearings and any unfair implication made would
be vigorously protested, Again, no agreement was reached,

On the evening of 9/29/75 we were advised the hearings
were being rescheduled for 10/1/75,

Our records show that in 1965 we estimated Klan member-

of Klan organizations. At that time there were 14 Klan groups
in existence and we had penetrated everyone of them through
informants. Informants were operating in top-level positions

containing substantially the same information (copy attached)
was sent to the Attorney General. i

j Our operation of approximately 333 informants to provide

| coverage of Klan activities in 1965 at the time when Klan member-

| ship was estimated at slightly less than 10,000 statistically

| indicates a 3.3 percent infiltration or one in thirty as contrasted
| to the Senator's statement of "one in five." Our reference to
nearly 2,000 of our informants and sources did not indicate these

exclusively. These informants and sources were being operated

to obtain up-to-date intelligence data concerning racial matters
generally. ;

Copies of the letters dated 9/2/65 to the White House

: and the Attorney General were released 8/14/75 under the Freedom

{ of Information Act to Mr. Orr Kelly, Washington Star-News,

Washington, D. C. and approximately 12 other newsmen. Although

la copy of the 9/2/65 letter to the White House has been furnished
to the SSC, we do not know that Senator Schweiker has access to

it nor do we know the source of his information regarding Klan
embership figures. Undoubtedly, Senator Schweiker was utilizing .
the figures 2,000 informants and approximately 10,000 Klan i

members when making referénce to “one in five members of the. Ku
Klux Klan was a paid FBI" (informant).

In 1965, the Klan was involved not only in atrocities
such as the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi,
the murders of Viola Liuzzo and-Col. Lemuel Penn, but was also
associated with numerous hombing incidents and other activities.

As you know, this Bureau has solved a mimber of cases
! involving racial viclence in the South, In this regard, public
attention particularly was focused on the FBIts role in the ~
solution of the brutal murders of Mrs, Viola Liuzzo, Lieutenant -
Colonel Lemuel A, Penn, and the three civil rights workers in
Mississippi. However, we have achieved a number of other tangible
accomplishments, most of which are not publicly known, and I i
thought the President might be interested in them. :

-At the present time, for example, nearly to thousand |]
of our informants and sources are being operated to obtain
up-to-date intelligence data concerning racial matters which. we
disseminate on a continuing basis, Of these, 774 have been
developed in just the past yeare-an average of more than two eack
day for every day in the past twelve months,

Particularly significant has been the high-level
penetration we have achieved of Kian organizavions > At the .
i - - -present time, there are 14 Klan groups in existence. We have
ie ‘ penetrated every one of them through informants and currently

Through such coverage, much valuable information
relating to a variety of cases of violence and planned violence

and other explosives which had been stolen from Fort McClellan in
Alobama, Still another strategically placed informant enabled :
us to identify the klansmen responsible for tha bombing of two
automobiles and a Negro mortuary at New Born, North. Carolina,

Tae soluticn to the series of bombings and burnings of some 20

to 25 hones in the McComb, Mississippi, area last year similarly
was based on information supplied by one of our informants:

Equally important, and something of which the public is
totally unaware, is the extent to which we have been able to- :
forestall violence in certain racially explosive areas, In one
southern state, for éxample, the governor, on ohe occasion,
expressed his great concern and fear of an outbreak of racial
violence because of the tense situation, But the head of the
Klan organization in that state is our informant, and we have
bad him warn every menber of his organization that he will not
tolerate violence in any form. As a result, we have been
successful to date in holding Klan violence in the entire state
to an absolute minimun,

We also are seizing every opportunity to disrupt
the activities of Klan organizations, Typical is the manner in
which we exposed and thwarted a "kick back" scheme a Klan group
was using in one southern state te help finance its activities.
Cne member of the group was selling insurance to other Kian
menbers and would deposit & genexous portion of the premium
funds in the Klan treasury. As a result of action we took,
the insurance company learned of the scheme anc cancelled ail.
the policies heid Ly the Klan members, thereby cutting off 6
Sizable source of revenue which had been uséd to finance Klan ¢
activities,

I have furnishec these examples to illustrate to the
President the approach this Buresu is taking to meet the challenge
of racial lawlessness in certain areas today and want him to know
of our datermination te press forward in this vein even more
vigorously in the futuxe in line with his determination te
establish a peacefui and prosperous society in this Nations

Director Sec'y

At. his request Deputy Associate Director. James B. Adams
and SA Paul V. Daly of this Division met with Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral Harold R. Tyler, Jr., om October. 3, 1975. Tyler advised
that. he had shown former Attorney General Mecholas’ deB. Katzenbach
the original Bureau memoranda captioned "Martin Luther King" dated
5/17/65, 10/19/65 and 12/12/65 pertaining to authorization for
microphone surveilance on Martin Luther King. He was also shown a
note dated 12/10/65 directed from him’ to Mr. Hoover with his initials
affixed at the bottom thereof. Mr. Tyler related that Katzenbach,
after reviewing the aforementioned documents, stated that it was
doubtful that’ he had approved thé microphone surveillances contained
in the memoranda, although he admitted the initials looked like his
own. Katzenbach advanced two arguments as to why he did not believe
he had approved the electronic surveillance requests.

(1) He stated the Martin Luther King investigation was.

. very controversial topic and he was. very concerned about it. Ac,

ing to Mr. Tyler, Katzenbach stated he was so concerned about

matter that he had discussed it with the President. In view

concern, Katzenbach stated that if he had approved such requests

electronic surveillance he would have certainly have recalled Sing
so and he had no such recollection.

(2). Katzenbach stated it was not his policy to give
after-the-fact approval to electronic surveillance requests. (The
aforementioned memoranda were all requests for electronic surveil-
lance dated after the surveillance was. utilized.) Katzenbach in-
formed Mr. Tyler that he had reviewed his diary and on at least one
of the occasions when electronic surveillance was. used, he was avail-
able to approve prior to the use of the device and, therefore, there
would have been no need for after-the-fact ratification. ES SEG

Legal Counsel to Mr.. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Katzéenbach, according to Mr. Tyler, was shown the
Xeroxes of the aforementioned documents by the Senate Select
Committee during interview by that Committee apparently per-
taining to his authorization of electronic surveillance on
Martin Luther King.

It was pointed out by Mr. Adams that former Attorney
General Katzénbach in a memorandum dated 9/27/65. captioned
"Special Investigative Techniques" thatshe stated, in part,
concerning wiretaps and microphones "It is my understanding
that such devices will not be used without my authorization,
although in emergency circumstances. they may be used subject -
to my later ratification:"

Mr. Tyler stated that Katzenbach had.not mentioned this
particular communication and that he, Tyler, did not know that ‘such
a communication existed.’ Mr. Tyler stated that he and the Attorney
General had indicated to Katzenbach that in order to clear up this
question it would probably. be necessary that he submit to interview
and that certain investigations be conducted. Mr. Tyler mentioned
particularly that. handwriting examinations might be necessary to
verify the authenticity of the initials affixed to’ the documents

| in question. Mr. Tyler stated he would send the Bureau a memorandum
requesting a certain investigation to clarify this question.

Mr. Chairman, I wish to furnish the Subcommittee
additional details regarding our mail covers and. surveys;
however, some of this information enters sensitive areas. a
involving national security, and I respectfully request it
be presented in executive session.

As I have indicated previously, the FBI's use
of maii covers and surveys as investigative techniques has been
based on fulfilling its lawfully mandated responsibilities.

The list of intelligence accomplishments resulting
from mail covers on foreign establishments alone is long,
but perhaps these examples will suffice:

In February, 1975, a member of the military holding
a "secret" clearance obtained while in training was determined

to be in contact with a foreign establishment.

Also last February, an individual with a "secret"
clearance employed on a missile project was in such contact.
In November, 1974, a scientist involved in atomic

research was determined to be in-such contact.

With reference to our former use of mail survey
operations in which we surveyed mail for indicators as to whether
further processing was warranted, permit me to further explain
the eight operations which I previously outlined in public
testimony:

Of these surveys, one was established in New York
as a result of the experience gained in the investigation
of a Soviet illegal. This illegal cooperated with the FBI;
and we learned that in directing mail to-his Moscow center,
he addressed it in a specific fashion and also directed it N
to mail drops in Europe.

From this experience, we were able to develop a
set of indicators which allowed us to select mail which we
felt was illegal agent mail. This, coupled with our knowledge
of known Soviet mail drops on this side of the Iron Curtain,
permitted effective screening of the mail and selection of
letters on a knowledgeable basis.

This method was proved successful when we uncovered

. three such illegals and successfully neutralized their
activities. This survey was conducted between 1959 and 1966.

A second survey was based on the use of these same
indicators in examining incoming mail directed to certain areas”
of New York City and other cities in an effort to detect mail
being directed to illegal agents in the United States. This

survey was conducted between 1961 and 1962.

-2-



‘A third survey was based on our knowledge that
illegal agents in the United States directed communications
to Soviet-bloc intelligence officers employed at the United
Nations in New York City. Again, this survey was based on
solid information that this means of communication was
utilized by the hostile intelligence service. ‘This survey
was conducted between 1963 and 1966.

A fourth survey was conducted i the Miami, Florida,
area. -It also utilized the known indicators and the known
mail drop addresses on mail being sent from the United States
to Cuba. As an example, during the period of time this program

existed in Miami, from January 2, 1963, until July 21, 1966,

60 letters were determined to contain secret ink messages
either on the letter or on the envelope.
Fifth and sixth surveys were directed against mail being
sent to the United States from the People's Republic of China
and Hong Kong, as well as mail directed from the United States
to China. The coverage of mail from the People's Republic

of China and Hong Kong was initiated August 1, 1956, and was

discontinued on January 24, 1966. The coverage of mail directed |
to China operated between 1964 and 1966.

A seventh survey involved mail being sent from Chinese
individuals residing in Canada to Chinese individuals residing
in the San Francisco, California, area. This survey operated

for two months in early 1961.

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 296
L



e 6

The purpose of these fifth, sixth and seventh surveys

‘was to acquire information concerning Americans living in China of
| : interest to the intelligence agencies of the United States; to detect
efforts by the People's Republic of-China to persuade scientists
of Chinese descent in the United States to return to the
People's Republic of China; to detect efforts to arrange
_travel by these scientists and to learn any information they
would provide the People's Republic of China; to ascertain
identities of subscribers to and recipients of Chinese
propaganda publications; and to develop information concerning
persons of security interest in the United States who were
corresponding with persons in the People's Republic of China.

The eighth survey, conducted from 1940 to 1966,
was of mail addressed to Bovis eigs ane other embassies and
diplomatic missions of national security interest.

This program was initiated shortly before the
United States entered World War II and its vital necessity
during those perilous times seems obvious.

Following World War II, the eighth operation was
concentrated against the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc countries,
and much greater selectivity was used in screening letters
fea be opened. ;

We were able, for example, in 1964 to detect

‘tthe fact a civilian employee of the United States Navy

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 297



offered to sell classified information to the Soviet Embassy
for $50,000. 7

With regard to the FBI's participation in the CIA
mail interception project, when we were offered data from
that operation, we initially set forth four specific areas
of data which could be of value to our national security
responsibility:

1. Correspondence of a suspicious nature which
might contain double talk;

2. Correspondence indicating Soviets. might. be
-using a hostage situation to develop sources in the United States.

3. Correspondence indicating a weakness or
dissatisfaction on the part of aby Soviet in the United states.

4, Information indicating Soviet control or direction
of the Communist Party, U.S.A. a

In August, 1961, we advised the CIA-that we were
interested in letters in which the United States addressee
or addressor was ‘a Government employee, working in a
sensitive industry, or an American wishing to defect to
Russia.

In February, 1962, we established additional
guidelines regarding the type of letters for which we had

a requirement to help further our efforts to uncover illegals.

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 298 -5-



Knowledgeable FBI officials reviewed this data
periodically, and surveys were conducted, to assure that we
were receiving only data pertinent to our legitimate

. responsibilities. :

May I conclude by saying, Mr. Chairman, that the
FBI was motivated in these matters by a genuine desire to
faithfully discharge our national security responsibilities --
to detect and identify illegal foreign agents and persons

willing to serve them.

I. FBI USE OF MAIL COVERS

Legal basis for mail covers

The FBI utilizes mail covers as an investigative
technique in accordance’ with requirements set down by
law and the Postal Service. Procedures for obtaining
mail covers are precisely set out in the Postal Manual,
Section 861.

The legality of mail covers has been substantiated
by a number of court decisions, beginning with Mr. Justice
Field's statement in Ex parte Jackson (1877); recognition

of this view through Oliver v. United States (1957); United

States v. Costello (1958); United States v. Schwartz (1960);

Cohen v. United States (1967); Lustiger v. United States (1968);

United States v. Isaacs (1972); cert. denied 417 U.S. 976 (1974).

History of Utilization by FBI of mail covers

The FBI has utilized mail covers allowed by the
U. S. Post Office Department and subsequently the Postal
Service as early as 1928. FBI procedures have been in
accordance with Post Office policies and procedures in
effect at a particular time.

From 1928 to 1945, Special Agents in Charge of
respective field offices were authorized to request a mail

cover from the appropriate Post Office official in their

DocId:32989667 Page 301



es oo

respective territories. In 1945, the FBI policy was changed

to allow the SACs this authority only in cases involving
deserters, fugitives and escaped Federal prisoners. All

other cases required FBI Headquarters approval. In 1947,

the FBI's policy was returned to the pre-1945 rule and

SACs were again permitted to request authority from the

Post Office without approval of FBI Headquarters. In 1954,
however, regulations were instituted whereby all inail covers
were to be limited to thirty days and justified to Headquarters
prior to being requested. This policy of final determination

by FBI Headquarters is in effect today.

Current statistics of mail covers utilization by FBI

As of September 26, 1975, current mail covers requested
or in place totaled 79. They were as follows: National
security ~ 61; Fugitive - 18; Criminal - 0.

The number of mail covers represents a minute
fraction of the total number of investigations pending on

a daily basis.

Authorization procedures consistent with Postal regulations

The FBI follows the procedures for obtaining mail
covers set out in the Postal Manual, Section 861. Inasmuch
as the FBI fits the "law enforcement agency" definition in

the Manual, we make our requests to the Chief Postal Inspector

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 302



7 }€ é

or the Regional Postal Inspectors in Charge, depending on
the type of mail cover requested.

No level of authorization in the requesting agency
is specified in the Postal Manual. However, as indicated
above, present FBI regulations require that mail cover
requests must be first cleared through FBI Headquarters
for approval.

FBI Headquarters screens the request to insure
that the mail cover can be potentially productive and that
the nature of the case is of sufficient import to justify
the technique. These decisions are made upon justification
from the field office, review by Headquarters' supervisory
personnel, with final decision resting at the Deputy Associate

Director level or above.

Benefits achieved by mail covers

Mail covers have proved to be valuable as an
investigative technique in certain investigations. For example,
mail covers have led to the identification of individuals
holding security clearances who contact hostile intelligence
services and who have provided intelligence information of
interest to the hostile foreign intelligence services.

Over the years mail covers have provided leads
which have resulted in the location of fugitives. In
criminal cases, mail covers have provided information that

has led to the discovery of evidence of criminal violations.

Purpose of mail covers

Lawful mail covers as an investigative technique are
based on the premise that discovery of an individual's
contacts provides knowledge of the individual's actions,
as well as indicates other avenues by which knowledge of
the individual can be obtained.

Objectives, of course, vary depending on the
type of investigation involved. For example, in fugitive
cases, mail covers may be used in instances when the
fugitive's close associates or relatives are obviously
hostile or suspected of being so. When official contact
by law enforcement with these persons is rebuffed or
impractical, mail covers are often useful.

In selected situations where a crime has been
committed or an attempt made to do so, mail covers can
be used to identify participants or co-conspirators and
provide leads in investigations.

In national security matters, the insight provided
by mail covers is invaluable. The FBI's successful fulfillment
of its national security role rests largely in determining
the activities of hostile intelligence services. The mails
are obviously a means of communication which allows a
foreign intelligence service accessibility to persons or

places from which they would otherwise be prohibited by

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 304



law or where their physical presence would be suspect and
thereby negate a covert effort on their part. Knowledge of
their mail contacts can open avenues of lawful investigation

which can be most productive.
II. FBI PARTICIPATION IN CIA MAIL INTERCEPTS

The FBI first learned of the CIA mail intercept
project .from a CIA official in January, 1958. The official
confidentially advised our liaison Agent that CIA had an
operation in New York in which mail going to, and coming
from, Russia was being examined by CIA.

We were advised the project had been furnishing
valuable economic and political information in Russia as
well as the identities of sources and potential defectors
in Russia. The CIA operation presented excellent potential
for uncovering Soviet espionage operations in this country.

On January 24, 1958, our liaison Agent was told by
CIA representatives that the CIA had initiated negotiations
with the Post Office in 1952, and finally had worked out
arrangements for this project, with the approval of Postmaster
General Arthur E. Summerfield.

Our understanding was that under that arrangement
CIA would be permitted to initiate mail cover on mail going

to and from Russia.

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 305


en | +

The CIA coverage first involved merely photographing
the envelopes, and later resulted in the opening of mail.
| CIA told us it had acquired considerable data of

foreign intelligence value. CIA also indicated a willingness

to handle leads for the FBI regarding matters within our

national security responsibilities.

It was recommended, and approved by Director Hoover,
that we ask CIA to advise us of any product of their operation
that would be valuable to us in discharging our national
security responsibilities. Once the receipt of material
began it was reviewed by knowledgeable Bureau officials to
assure the information was pertinent to our responsibilities
and justified our continuing to receive such information.

Our interest was in detecting foreign espionage
agents and individuals in a position to do harm to our
' national security and indicating willingness to do so.

In December, 1962, we were advised by CIA that it
; was handling mail between the United States and Cuba. We were

asked if we had any requirements for the product of that

operation. We responded with a request for data -- which we
carefully delineated -- that would be of assistance to us in
fulfilling our mandated national security responsibilities.
In March, 1963, the CIA discontinued coverage of

mail going to Cuba.

| NW 55256 Docld:32989667 Page 306


iL

In February, 1973, the FBI was approached regarding
taking over the CIA mail intercept project. We did not, and
in May, 1973, we received the last data from this CIA operation.

In summary, our relationship with this CIA project
extended from 1958 to May, 1973. We have no figures for the
number of items we received during the initial stages of that
operation; however, beginning in August, 1964, we began
preparing summaries of items received.

The full-year count ranged from a low of 1,353 in

1972 to a high of 6,256 items in 1967.
III. FBI USE OF MAIL SURVEYS

The FBI has conducted eight mail survey operations
solely in the discharge of its national security responsibilities.
None has been conducted since 1966.

These surveys were instituted because of their
potential value in discharging the FBI's responsibilities
in the national security field.

These surveys were conducted to detect and identify
foreign agents who threaten this Nation's security and to
detect other persons who indicated willingness, and were
in a position, to sell out this country to hostile foreign
powers. Each survey program was carefully circumscribed
as to its scope and was conducted for specific objectives

with strict administrative controls.

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 307



NW 55256

 € ‘

These surveys involved the processing, or opening,
of mail; but they did not involve wholesale, indiscriminate
opening of mail. In these surveys we were looking for
indicators as to whether review of the correspondence might
lead to the detection of an illegal foreign agent or a
person cooperating with a hostile foreign power. Although
considerable volumes of envelopes were surveyed, the vast
majority of this mail was not further processed because it
did not contain indicators which would make it relevant to

the survey.

This informative memorandum records contacts with

On 10/3/75, baijlteam Qzegaki, took a telephone

call from one Loyd R. Reedy who advised he was calling from co
California. WEeISEE He had been telephonically contacted

by someone claiming to be on the SSC who desired to interview
Reedy. Reedy did not get the caller's name and did not
determine what the caller wanted to interview him about.
Nothing definite was arranged between Reedy and the caller.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

in Reedy, ELLiff was briefed on Reedy's very short tenure
of service and what he had done in the Bureau. It was
indicated to E11iff that if Reedy was mot contacted by a
representative of the SSC, it is possible someone is so
impersonating himself,

During the week of 10/6/75, Reedy telephoned in
again from California and spoke to Daly who told him that if
he is again contacted by anyone representing the SSC, Reedy
should determine the person's name and nature of the
interview desired, Thereafter, Reedy should call the Legal
Counsel Division collect. We have heard nothing further
from Reedy.

Daly has also advised that EL11iff has told him
that, after checking at the SSC, EL1Liff was unable to determine
any interest in Reedy, El1liff did not indicate the extent
to which he looked into this matter,

OBSERVATIONS :

It is extremely unlikely that the SSC would have
any interest in Reedy who had only three months service in
the position indicated in 1970. If an SSC representative
did, in fact, contact Reedy, it may be they have the wrong
person, There is no action we need to take at this time as
Reedy is on notice that if contacted again, he should obtain
specifies and then call the Legal Counsel Division,

with Me, Cuthman, Department of Justice. Mx. Guthman ropliad
that tho Attorney Goneral had gotten all mixed up in his
conversation with the Director. Guthman admitted Mr. DeLoach
made no reference to any letter.

In response te Item 42, Bureau files contain numerous
communications received subsequent to Director Hoaver's
speech at Loyola University. Some of thease communications
are in the form of laudatory xomarks to the Director for his
appearance and his speech from individuals connected with
the program, Other communications were from the Director
to various individuals thanking thom for the courtesies
extended to him while in Chicago. Copies of these comnuni-
gationsarea not being made a part of tha response.

Item 43 requested copies of porformance ratings of
Willian b. Campbell and John Vatter for the years 1963 until
1968. Yhis material is not keing furnished but will be available
for review at PBI Headquarters pursuant to previously agreed
upon arrangements pertaining to the roview of perfor ce ratings.

With respect to the excisions in materials boing
Gclivered horcewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for oxcision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In sone
cases, it can be ascertained procisoly what information in
FBI files came from electronic surveillance of King; howover,
there oxist areas where documentation of the information is
not precise and no accurate determination can be made, Therefore,
no assurances can ke given that portions of the material boing
furnished do not contain information developed as a rosult of
electronic surveillances of King.

The remaining materials in SSC xequests relating to
King and/or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference are
receiving continuous attention and the ¥esulis will be forwarded
on a poriodic basis as soon as possible.

RE: SUPERSEDING KEQUEST FOR FBI MATERIALS

iv
HOTS: SEQRET

This note is clhssified "Secret" in order to protect
the confidentirlity of our reletionship with the} French
Security Service, infra, the disclosure of which Could
reasonebly be expected to result in serious damege to
national security. The subject of above SSC inquiry, Joseph
Kraft, is the well-known newsprper columnist. A review
of the Kreft file reveals that the French Security Service,
the DST, conducted a microphone surveillence on Kraft's hotel
roon for (Spec covera one week during a 1969 visit by Kraft

to Peris.(Sfuch coverage was effected through the urging of

We c. itwven, former /ssistant to the Director, who traveled
to France et such time apparently at the direction of deceased
FBI Director J, Edger Hoover. Deteils of the above coverage
have appoered in the medic epperently as o result of leaks
within the administration of formar President Nixon. Kreft
himself testified in detail 5/10/74, vegarding this motter
before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Administrative
Fractice and ‘rocedure, the Subcommittee on Constitutionel
Rights of the Committee on the Judicirry, end the Subcommittee
on Surveiilence of the Committee on Foreign Reletions. We
have previously responded to en earlier request of the SSC

in the memoranda of 6/20/75, end 9/2/75, wherein we advised
that no cuthorizetion per se could be loceted for the 1969
electronic surveillence of Kraft during « visit to France,

In answering this request the criteric utilized was to select
those serials which would provide ¢ good summary of the Kraft
neterial without being required to Xerox and excise the whole
file. Some of the meterirl was excised cnd/or clessified in
accordance with existing procedures in order to protect
identities of sources, disclosure of whose identities might
have an adverse effect on the national security. We have
also included selected items dealing with the various negotietions

nationalist activity, and interested in counterintelligence,

to coordinate this program. This Agent will be responsible

for the rerioedic “yess letters heing reguested, but eech

Agent w % this type of case should ticipate in the
formulation of counterintelligence operations. -

GOALS

For maximun effectiveness of the Counterinteliigence
Program, and to prevent wasted isin long-range goals are
being set.

i. Prevent the conlition of militant black
nationalist groups. In unity Théré is strength; a truism
that is no less valid for all its triteness. An effective
coalition of black nationalist groups might be the first
step toward a real “au Mau" in America, the beginning of
a true*black revolution.

2. Brevent the vise of a “nessiab" whe could
unify, and electrify, the nilitant Black Hationalist movement.
Healcoim % might have been such a “hessinh;" he is the martyr
of the movement today. -Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael

- and Elijah Nuhammed all aspire toe this position. Slijah

Muhammed is less of a threat because of his age. King could
be a very reali contender for this position should he abandon

fnonvislence) and embrace black nationalism. Carmichael
has the necessary charisma to be a reali threat in this way.

3. Prevent violence on the part of black
nationalist groups. This Is of primary importance, and is,
of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it should
also be a goal of the Counterintelligence Program. Through
counterintelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential
troublemakers and neuiralize them hefore they exercise their H
potential gor violence.

4, Provent militant black nationalist groups and
leaders from gaining respectability, by discrediting them
to three separate segments oF thé Community. The goal of
discrediting black nationalistsmust be handled tactically
in three ways. You must discredit these groups and
individuals to, first, the responsible Negro community. §
Second, they must be discredited to the white community,

tactics from the first two. Publicity about violent tendencies
and radical state ents merely enhances black nationalists

to the last group; it adds “respectability” in a dificrent
way. :

: 5. A final goal should be to prevent the long-
range growth of militant black nationalist organigaticas
especia mong youth. Enpecifie tactics to prevent these
groups from converting young people must be developed.

Beside: these five goals counterintelligence is
Q valuable part of our regular investigative program as it
often produces positive information.

TARGLTS

the Counteyvintellizence ‘progra QE,

- Black ‘Natiohalist-ate Groups, shovld be the most violent

gnd radical groups and their loadexs We should emphasize
those leaders and organizations that are nationvide in scope
and are most capable of 2 upting this country. These
kargets should incluce the radical and violence-prone

‘ Jeaders, monbers, and followers of the:

The effectiveness of counterintelligence depends
on the quality and quantity of positive information
available re ding the target and on the imagination and
initiative of Agents working the program, The response of
the field to the Counterintelligence Program against the
Communist Party, USA, indicates that 2 superb job can be
Gone by the field on counterintelligence.

Counterintelligence operations must be approved
by the Bureau. Because of the nature of this program each
operation must be designed to protect the Bureau's interest

Our counterintelligence efforts will be designed to

‘prove Communist influence and expose the Communist connections

of those associated with KING. It is reasonable to assume that if
SPOCK and KING do become candidates they will take steps to make
this more difficult, because it is a most damaging charge.

An indication of what may happen can be seen in a report by one
New York informant who said there was an uncoordinated effort

to keep SWP and CP members out of the Spring Mobilization by

not telling them of the time and place of some preliminary
organizational meetings. However, the Communists were not

about to be kept out, and they did, of course, participate in

the Spring Mobilization. CONEIDENTIL, SURE

If Freedom House maint is its opposition to KING,
this may be our best channel fop%accomplishing our counter-

peak aera yeni objectives. J IORSELL of the NAACP is a trustee

‘Smears’ Are Deplored

In speaking out, we should
not hesitate to male the most
outspoken briefs for the de-
eencies we believe in. For
example:

“The smears President John-
son has been subjected to are
a disgrace to those who make
and appleud them, as Merri-
man Smith has recently
noted. Over and above John-
son the man or the politician,
the office of the President
must be respected,

‘This is hard on’ those who
gre embittered by the war,
but we should tell them in no
uncertain terms that the hope
‘of democracy is that its dis-
senters voluntarily and under

~ no legal penalties draw the
line well before the, danger

‘The cynical exploitation of
developments in the war in
Vietnam for the purpose of’
securing , political “advantage
should bé deplored.

Burning and otherwise des-
erating th eAmerican flag is |

“a despicable act. Those who
commit it are enemies of the
particular man in the White
House or the party in power,

“but enemies of the society |

itsclé and the values it stands
for. We shovld continue to
answer, as we did in our
statement of last October, the
irresponsible attacks ' on
American conduct of the Viet-
nam war. *

‘The mood of intolerance,
particularly among young
people, has been vividly dem-
‘onstrated in the recent denial
to Gov. George Wallace of his
right to speak at Darmouth
College and the equally repre-

hhensible reception accorded to.

hs)
The Communist Party's backing of a peace ticket i

featuring MARTIN LUTHER KING and BENJAMIN SPOCK during the
1968 Presidential election without a doubt offers a
counterintelligence potential of a possible magnitude which
we previously have not had opportunity to explore. However,
as observed by both New York and Chicago in re communications
this potential cannot as yet be accurately evaluated. .

As noted in re communications, we do not yet

kuew whether KING will change his mind regarding presidential
ceundidacy. He recently disclaimed any interest in politics
and it is possible he may remain steadfast in this positicn
despite the efforts of SPOCK, the Communist Party, and others
to enlist him in a political race. At this moment, it does
not appear that we would have much opportunity for effective
action unless KING changes his mind.

Atlanta agrees with Chicago's observation as to the :
piagprobable effect not only on KING himself but the entire 1968

Ypolitical situation of the Viet Nam conflict. Again, it will
be necessary for us to bide our time until we are able to
resolve this facet or at least feel confident in estimating
the significance thereof.

It is felt that New York's suggestion that Freedon
House might present a practical channel for our objective
is very practical. Particularly since Freedom House has in
@ sense opened the door in this regard by its recent
publicized paper and since we appear to have an existing
relationship with a trustee ef" that anaes

' It is agreed that the Communist:Party's (CP)
i interest in a peace ticket headed by MARTIN LUTHER KING and
BENJAMIN SPOCK offers the appearance of a counterintelligence
opportunity. The reference to this matter in Bureau letter
dated 5/18/67 obviously relates to the Presidential elections
of November, 1968.

As a practical matter it is nearly certain that a
KING-SPOCK ticket would have no chance to record more than a -
minute fraction of support from the electorate. The political
Situation between now and Navember, 1968, couid change
drastically, with Viet Nam being the point of chief concern
for all candidates,

Certainly the present administration will do every-
thing possible to bring about a resolution of the conflict in
“ Southeast Asia. The dangers attendant to the administration's
present policies are both military and political. From the
military standpoint, the ever present possibility of direct

Chinese intervention is quite evident. ‘

The political realities are such that President
JOHNSON, if he is unsuccessful in bringing about negotiations,
would have to go to the electorate and ask for another term
while three quarters-of a million American fighting men are
af engaged in a terribly difficult war half a world away. It is
not an envious position for any Presidential candidate, even

Thus, at this time it is not easy to believe that the
present Situation will remain steady through November, 1968.
As a consequence, our exploitation at this time or even in the
near future of the communist backing of a KING-SPOCK ticket
offers a questionable vehicle to move against the Party.
Certainly they cannot be attacked because they favor a peaceful
settlement of the Viet Nam war,

Even the President's more responsible opponents on
Viet Nam have taken to careful delineations of their stand.
The 16 so-called Senate "doves" in May of this year issued a :
-statement clarifying their position. They made quite clear that
while they. believed in negotiations they did not advocate
withdrawal. of U.S.. forces nor were they expressing a lack of
confidence in the morality of the U,S, position. This Senate
group included Senators FULBRIGHT, KENNEDY, HARTKE and CHURCH.

Attacking anyone, even communists, because they favor
peace would seem a dubious tactic. Should we soon commence
nationwide exposure of the KING-SPOCK-communist alliance, we
might be chagrined to see, in the period between now and the
summer of 1968, developments resulting in a truce or other
cessation of hostilities in Viet Nam. Then we would have only
been instrumental in publicizing the efforts of a small segment
which coincided with the efforts of the Johnson administration.
The communists and their accomplices do not deserve such lelp.

If a counterintelligence program is in order in this
field, it should be prepared but held until the spring or
early summer of 1968. By then the Johnson administration will
have undoubtedly done everything in its power to resolve the
conflict. If successful, the glory will accrue to the present

.administration., Jf their efforts have failed, then the CP and
their KING~SPOCK tandem will be whooping-up the peace theme.
At that time exposure of the relationship would be most
pertinent. It would also doubtlessly be appreciated by the
administration. Effectively tabbing as communists or as
communist~backed the more hysterical opponents of the President
on the Viet Nam question in the midst of the Presidential
campaign would be a real boon to Mr. JOHNSON.

The specific means of exposing the KING-SPOCK-CP.
i - relationship would require very careful consideration,
i ReBulet mentioned the circulation of material such as flyers,

aeteer aes

leaflets,.cards and bumper stickers, We would not rule out
these devices. We would suggest that our use of such tactics,
if ever made known or even hinted at, could be the source of
the most severe sort of embarrassment for the Bureau. It
could be asked, with telling cogency, "What does the FBI

have to do with the selection of Presidential candidates?"
The only possible answer could be "Nothing."

Should it be decided that a counterintelligence
move be started on this question in the spring of summer of

_ 1968, we suggest the use bed a political columnist or reporter

for this purpose.

A reporter or columnist of national stature,
properly briefed, could write an excellent account of the
KING-SPOCK ticket. It is the sort of article or series
expected of a first rate reporter with first rate sources,

It is suggested that the Bureau consider our
comments as reflected above. Consider also a top columnist
or reporter who might be interested in the KING-SPOCK story.
At is emphasized that this persen should be respected for his
palance and fair-mindedness. An article or series by an
established conservative would not adequately serve our
purposes, In this area the Bureau might desire to consider

“a columnist such as CHARLES BARTLETT. A former confidant

of President KENNEDY, he has excellent sources throughout

the government and is not too close to the present administra-
tion to be branded as a propagandist. His relationship with
Senator KENNEDY and the Senate "dove" group also would negate
the charge that he is attempting to discredit these men.

Left standing would be the realization that BARTLETT had

good sources and came up with a top story in the midst of the
Presidential campaign. And BARTLETT, as a professional
journalist, would not be about to divulge the identity of

his sources. Thus the Bureau would stand harmless.

It is not known whether the Bureau has information
which would make BARTLETT's selection undesirable. If his
selection is not feasible, there are others in the newspaper
field who could serve as well. But it is clear that this
man should write on a national level and should not be a
protagonist for either those of the "hawk" or "dove"
persuasion.

Since the contact with BARTLETT would be made in
Washington, no specific recommendation is being made at this
time.

HUNTER PITTS/0'DELL

Resorting to its typical methods of infiltration
into any organization to carry out its primary cbjectives
of building up controversy and widespread unrest, Communist
Party, USA, has succeeded in getting one of its most |
experienced organizers in the south inte the key position
of consultant to the field staff of Reverend Martin Luther
King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference, In an
article reporting the news conference in Birmingham,
Alabama, on 9/26762 with Reverend King, "The New York Times"
‘reported Jack H. 0'Dell_ is the regional consultant to a
staff of workers in at least six southern states engaged 7
in helping community organizations to establish registration £EE
schools, work shops and public meetings.

AE “O'Dell, who has been known as Hunter Pitts O'Dell
Since fis birth 1n 1923 at Detroit, Michigan, attended
Xavier University in Louisiana, He sailed as a seaman in
the Merchant Marine Service until he was expelled from the
National Maritime Union in 1950 at Galveston, Texas, for
circulating pro~Soviet peace petitions attackilig the United © y
States Government. i 4

During hearings before the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee on the scope of Soviet activity in the United |
‘States in 1956, G'Deil took refuge in the Fifth Amendment to H
" answer questions relating to his activities as a Communist |
| Party organizer for the New Orleans and Gulf Coast area.

: “Hundreds of documents seized by the New Orleans Police
Department at 0'Dell‘'s residence, 2319 Louisiana Avenue,

in March, 1956, when they were attempting to find him to

serve him with a subpoena to testify before the Senate
Subcommittee, clearly established his key position in the
communist movement in the South. ee

i On _ 7/30/58 at Atlanta, Georgia, O'Dell again
invoked the First’ and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution
when answering questions about his communist activities
upon his appearance as a witness before the House Committee
on Un-American Activities,

Since the publicity in 1956 surrounding his
activities on behaif of the Communist Party, O'Dell has
attempted to remain quietly in the background and carry
out his Party assignments through affiliation with such
organizations as the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. The American people can solve their own
problems more effectively and quickly if communists
such as O'Dell are clearly identified and their aims
and objectives fully understood by the public.

Reference is made’to the SSC request dated September 27,
1975, for materials pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jx., and the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
to the SSC of materials in full response to Items 1 and 2 of
page 1 of the aforementioned request.

It is noted that Item 2 of the SSC request refers to
page 8 of a letter from the Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta
Field Office to the Director, FBI, dated April 14, 1964, which
contains a suggestion for eounterintelligence activity with regard
to the donors to SCLC. An exhaustive review of our files at
FBI Headquarters and at the Atlanta Field Office was conducted to
determine if there was any official recording as to results of
Headquarters’ consideration regarding this suggestion. ‘This
review failed to uncover any documentation in official files. It
should be noted that, from the language used in the Atlanta letter,
it did not necessarily require that Headquarters furnish a response
to this suggestion.

We did, however, locate the original of a memorandum from ~
Mr, F. J. Baumgardner to Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated May 6, 1964,

a Xerox of which is being delivered to the SSC. This memorandua

was not sent to files since it was “killed” because, as noted in a

Memorandum from W, C, Sullivan to A, H, Belmont 12/24/63
summarized the results of a conference held at the Seat of Government
12/23/63 between Bureau officials and Supervisors and field repre-
sentatives designed to explore how best to carry on our investigation
of captioned matter to produce the desired results without embarrass-
ment to the Bureau, We completely analyzed avenues of approach aimed
at neutralizing Martin Luther King, Jr., as an effective Negro leader,, ..

financial operations of King and the organizations through which hel Uo
operates which investigation might reveal either violations of the
law or other potentials for discrediting King or otherwise neutralizing
his effectiveness,

4 ey

Bufiles contain two items of particular significance, A ~
Washington Capital News Service release dated 10/22/63 reveais that 4
King's integration organization had an income of more than $735,000
during the past fiscal year and spent only about half of it. It is “N
stated that in a report of the financial status of the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference (SCLC), of which King is President, King
disclosed that the organization had a balance of $351,992.20 left
8/31/63 at the end of the fiscal year from a total income of $735,534,02.
Another such news release dated 11/4/63 revealed that Representative
George Andrews (D-Ala.) asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ~~

investigate the tax status of the SCLC, Andrews is quoted as saying, ~ “S

"Thousands and thousands of dollars are collected and spent each year
by so-called civil rights organizations and many people are becinning”
to suspect they could be a front for a full-grown racket,"

RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA .: Z

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS
100-3-116 z

OBSERVATIONS:

It is believed that an examination of recent income tax
returns of King might well reveal information which could assist the
Bureau in its efforts to discredit King or neutralize his effective-
ness, This is possibly applicable also if the income tax returns of
the SCLC and the Gandhi Society were reviewed. In view of the possi-
bility that the SCLC has already been under some investigation by IRS,
a request for the results of such investigation is indicated, We also
had information in late 1963 that the Gandhi Society was negotiating
with IRS relative to tax exemptions and therefore the results of any
IRS investigation of that Society would be worth procuring,

To date we have been most discreet and circumspect in our
handling of the King investigation, as well as corollary investiga-
tions such as revolving around organizations, because of the position
King has not only as a clergyman, but also as a "respected" Negro
leader, It is therefore essential that our current requests of the
IRS which are herein being recommended be handled in a manner which

| vould provide for optimum security so that neither King nor any other

| unauthorized individuals may become aware of the Bureau's interest
and so that no embarrassment may come to the Bureau, For this reason,
the attached mémoranda are classified "Secret,"

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the Liaison Section obtain two
uncertified copies of each of the income tax returns available for
the past five years pertaining to King, the SCLC and the Gandhi
Society, Attached hereto are three memoranda for the use of the
Liaison Section,

Liaison Agent, P. D, Putnam has obtained the following inforwat
tion through A, R, Manzi of IRS.

Concerning the Gandhi Society, records of the Manhattan
District of IRS failed to reveal an income tax return, It is noted,
however, that on 3/20/63, the organization made an application for an
exempt organization status, ‘The application was denied, Reason for
denial is not known but believed to be that it was because the organiza-
tion had then not been in existence for 12 months. On 10/15/63 the
organization reapplied for exempt status which application is currently
pending in the Audit Division of the Manhattan District. ~

interestingly enough very large expenditures for such things as
transportation, hotels, taxis, tips and the like. For example,
the 1958 return shows over $6,000 expended for transportation,
over $2,500 for hotels, over $900 for taxis and tips, and $780
for entertainment expenses. The I959 return shows over $8,700
} expended for transportation, $425 for tips, and $550 for taxi
fares. :

Mr, Baumgardner's attached memorandum 3-25-64 reported
the results of an analysis of Martin Luther King"s income tax

;King's returns in the past but had not been able to establish”
a cause of action against him, While IRS has no action pending aoe
at this time, King's current income tax return will be scrutinized ~
very carefully to determine whether any violations appear. At

this time, however, IRS is taking no additional action on his

SECURITY MATTER - ¢

In connection with the Bureau's intensified investi-
gation yvelating to the communist influence in racial matters,
there was recently obtained from the Internal Révenue Service
{ERS} of the United States Treasury Department, on a
confidential basis, a file of data relating to captioned
individual. Attached are copies of the material obtained
which veveals a prior IRS investigation of King growing ont
of deficient taxes for the years 1957-1959. IRS considered
the application of a fraud penalty but found such to be
inappropriate as it was not able to establish fraudulent
intent. Of particular interest in the attached material are
references to Stanley David Levison and the claimed gifts of
$5,000 each during two years (2957 and 1958) from a ‘Loews,

You will xecali that in Becember, 1963, we had representatives .

of the Atlanta Office in Washington for a one-day conference relative,

to captioned investigation. \We recently requested the Atlanta and RBS8
New York Offices to analyze all aspects of/four investigation in this: S38 &
matter and submit suggestions ‘designed torexplore new avenues of S98
investigation and intensify investigation in areas already being ss 3
inquired into. The replies rec@ived from these offices have been Sse
thoroughly analyzed. Atlanta, ik particular, came up with what appears
to be some very worthwhile ideas hich merit further exploration. © Se
These relate to the following: gs
(1) Bill Shipp, State NeWs Editor,"Atlanta Constitution BFS
has been making inquiry in the Aibany, Georgia, area regarding the 8 8 3
reconstruction of three Negro churches, burned in that area during Sas
the Summex of 1962. In the pasts Ship? has written unfavorable gs
articles regarding Martin Luthe# King, ey and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) as it relatés to the employment of 38

Hunter Pitts O'Dell, He has also written \wegarding civil rights
groups having subversive sympathizers in their ranks, Atlanta note
that a delay in the reconstruction of the cHurches has been primar.
a result of the contractor not receiving funds from the SCLC on a :
periodic basis. Atlanta suggests the desirab’ ity of furnishing s
Shipp, on an anonymous basis, lead material which he may deveiop

to further write critical fitems. As an examples Atlanta notes that
a Catholic priest from south Alabama (mame unknown to the Atlanta

Office‘but possibly known: to the Mobile Office) publicly denounced
the SCLC after affiliation with it for several. years. He did this
based on his experience and knowledge of financial Wealings of the

however, that King has a persenal account in a New York City bank,
