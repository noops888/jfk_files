Last Friday, uo helù a press conference to announce local plans to support

the peace action in Chicago and to call our attention to the non-violent charac-

ter of the events scheculed by the National lobilization Committee during the

wook of rugust 24-29. While the media coverage was excellent, there still ap-

pears to be rumor and speculation . as well as outright labrication - reported

in some newspapers as to the intentions of the Chicago ilobilization. A nationally

circulated Scripps-Howard Story, printed in the Clevcland Press, Monday, august

19, is Iife with inflanatory statements which only serve to intinidate

the 11y

thousands at persons who vant to come to Chicago and demonsuzaio on the tune-

mental issues of militarism and raciSi.

But this is the way of the Establishment to "leak" their intelligence saporta

to the press in order to divide and vility the poace forces.

If one looks back

to the "intolligence leaks" a year ago last April or last Octobers then one will

Iind a greai similarity in the approach.

Ine point is -- we should not beli cue

these insider reports just as we do not ball ove the "official leaks" coming out

of Vietnam -- or the "official stories" about what is happening in the gettoes

at home.

The credibility gap also extends to the Administiation reporting about

out intentions and actions.

We have to be out own isporters and analysts of

what we intend to do'and how we go about doing it.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that the best way to insuro that

oui protests will bo peaceíul and non-violent is to be there in the ters o

thousands. The best protection we havo against polico violence jests upon the

great numbers of persons who refuse to be intinidated by the military. It no

really believe that the var in Vietnam is as barbaric and brutal as we say it

is -- is we really believe that millions of blacks suffer the indignities of

racist oppression. it ve really believe that the aifluence of this socioty is

built upon the blatant exploitation as the poor . if le belleve all this and

more - then we should be in Chicago to tell the world "like it is" -and rot bet

LBJ of Daly or any "inside" news report turn us around!

We should never be afraid

to demonstrate our demand to pui an end to the old politics or militarism and

racism - and begin a new politics of sanity and humanity in this country.

Very sancerely,

In peace and freedom,

"*The bureaucratic machine in Chicago was wound

up so tight it could not come up with a folsible response.

payable to: CAPAC, Iransportation rund!

Last Friday, wo helû a press conference to announce local plans to support

the peace action in Chicago and to call our attention to the non-violent charac

tor of the events scheduled by the National lobilization Committee during the

wook of augusi 24-29. lnile the media coverage was exceilent, there 3t1ll ap

pears to be zumor and speculation • as well as outright fabrication - reported

in some newspapers as to the intentions of the Chicago ilobilization. A nationally

circulated Scripps-Howard Story, printed in the Clevcland Press, Monday, mugust

19, is rife with inflanatory statcments which only serve to intinidate the rary

thousands of persong who want to come to Chicago and denonatizil on the iunda-

mental issues of militarism and racism.

But this la the way of the Establishment to "leal" shell intelligence seports

to the press in order to divide and vilily the peace forces.

If one looks back

to the "intelligence leaks" a year ago lost April or last October, then one will

Lind a orcat similarity in the approach.

The point in - we should not believe

these insider reports just as we do not bali cue tha "official leaks" coming ot

of vietnam -- or the "official stories" about what is happening in the ghettoes

ät hone.

The credibility gap also extends to the Administration reporting about

out intentions and actions.

We have to be our oin reporters and analysts os

what we intend to do and how we go about doing it.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that the best way to inswo that

out protests will bo peaceíul and non-violent is to be there in the tens of

thousands. The best protection we havo against polico violenco rests upon tha

great nuabers of persons who reluse to be intinidated by the military. If to

roally believe that the var in Vietnam is as barbaric and brutal as we say it

is - 11 we really believe that millions of blacks suffer the indignities of

racist oppiession

-- it ve really believe that the aifluence of this society in

built upon the blatant exploitation of the poor - if te believe all this and

more - then we should be in Chicago to tell the world "like it is" - and rot let

LBJ oI Daly or any "inside" news report turn us around!

We should never be afraid

to demonstrate our demand to pui an end to the old politics of militarisu and

racism - and begin a new politics of sanity and humanity in this country.

Very sincerely,

In peace and fidedon,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR

OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Re: Surreptitious Entries

It is my understanding that the Senate Select • -

Committee on domestic intelligence activities has requested

and received a number of documents from the Bureau. I am

also advised that you are maintaining duplicate copies of

these documents in an orderly form appropriately indexed.

I believe it is essential that the attorneys from

this Division who are assigned to the Division's inquiry

into surreptitious entries examine all documents which

have been furnished to the Senate Committee in order

that we may be aware of the information in possession

of the committee and also that we may be fully informed

as to the nature and extent of the Bureau's use of

surreptitious entries.

I have asked these attorneys to contact you to

arrange for a review of these documents.

Thank you very much for your continued cooperation

in .

this matter.

Attached is a memorandum from Michael E. Shaheen, Jr.,

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, to John A. Mintz,

Assistant Director, Legal Counsel Division, Federal Bureau of

Investigation, dated September 19, 1975, captioned "Deputy

Attorney General's Request for Materials."

The aforementioned memorandum requests delivery to

Mr. Shaheen's office of original Bureau documents so that the

documents could be reviewed by the Deputy Attorney General.

The documents relate to the Bureau's investigation and use

electronic surveillance on Martin Luther King, JI. They par-

ticularly refer to former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach's

authorization for the electronic surveillance of King.

Assistant Director Mintz suggested to Mr. Shaheen on

9/19/75 that since these documents are originals in line with

Bureau policy an

Agent would hand carry them to the Deputy

Attorney General's office when he desired to review the same

and that the Agent would retain possession of same. This was

agreeable to Mr. Shaheen and arrangements have been made for

a representative of the Legal Counsel Division to make these

documents available to the Deputy Attorney General when

requested.

but that the Bureau might wish to give consideration to plast

stops on certain key personalities.

Select Committee at public hearings 10/8/75.

At 12:48 p.m., 10/7/75, Mr. John T. Elliff, Director,

Domestic Intelligence Task Force of the Senate Select Committee,

advised Wannall telephonically that the Committee met in Executive

Session this morning. At the request of the President, the

Attorney General appeared before the Committee to explain why

it should not hold public hearings concerning National Security

Agency matters which matters were to be the subject of the 10/8/75

hearings. Mr. Elliff said that during the Executive Session

the Committee

voted to postpone the public hearings originally

scheduled for that date and, accordingly, Wannall should disregard

the previous Committee request for his appearance.

Mx . Elliff

made no comment as to whether the hearings would be held at ai

later date.

Director Soc'y

On 10/2/75, the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

requested background investigations of Anne Pellecchia

Horowitz and Marie Waite Fiske under a fourteen day dead-

line.

They are employees of Ward and Paul, Inc.,

steno-

graphic reporters. In their SSC applications both in-

dicated they have received recent Top Secret clearances

which had been issued by the Department of Defense; in

Miss Fiske's case clearance was

granted on 7/5/75; Miss

Horowitz received hers in 9/75.

On 10/3/75, Benjamin C. Marshall, SSC security

officer, advised SA Richard I. Taylor, Jì., a full field

background investigation of Misses Horowitz and Fiske would

not be necessary provided the Bureau verified their recent

Top Secret clearances through

appropriate channels such as

by verification at DIsCo. EX-115

In the future, Mr. MarshalI

requested he be coh23 1975

initiated.

Decisions as to the scope of the investigation

will be handled on a case by case procedure through Mr. Marshall.

-MITTEE ON CIVIL AND CONSTITUTIONAL. RIGHTS

L'HE HOUSE CON

ITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

Disposal of Records:

At the outset, we note the disposal of records is

governed by Statute (Title 44, United States Code, Chapter

33) and Regulation (Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations,

Subpart 101-11.4).

In addition, the Administrator of General

Services is directed by statute to "establish standards for

the selective retention of records of continuing value..."

ber 22, 1969, following a survey of the records management

program of the United States Department of Justice which

Included the FBI, the National Archives and Records Service

(NARS) created a

records retention plan for the FBI. This

plan designated records that have enduring Archival value

and which cannot be destroyed. NARS noted that "ordinarily

the records of a Federal agency that are worthy of permanent

retention amount to a rather small percentage of the total

volume of records generated. Many of the records produced

by the Federal, Burcau of Investigation, however, relate to

a number of controversial if not important aspects of the

history of the United States, particularly to the role of

the Federal Government in its relation to its citizens."

"To be sure, many years will pass before these records can

be made available to the public for historical and other

serious research.

Nevertheless, the Archival value of

-these recoras will not decrease

nor will interest in them

dissipate."

Those records not designated for permanent reten-

tion under the Records Retention Plan may be destroyed when

they have served their purpose.

Under Section 3303, Title 44,

United States Code, NARS approval must be secured, however;

for their destruction. Age of information in FBI

files

covers a relatively short span of years.

FBI had very few

tiles until the President in 1939, directed the FBI to be

responsible for the internal security of the United States.

In view of this and as the number of violations of law over

which the FBI has jurisdiction has nearly doubled since 1939,

the vast majority of FBI files has been created since 1939,

thus, giving them a contemporary value.

Ine iBi does, however, have an active program to

secure Archival authority for the destruction of records

which no longer have contemporary value.

In summary, the regulations of NARS require agencies

to maintain records recording their transaction of business.

These regulations also require agencies

to dispose of the

records when they have no further value. The FBI complics

with these-regulations.

PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO

AUTHORIZE UNUSUAL INVESTIGATIVE

TECUNIQUES IN FORFIGN INTELLIGENCE

INVISTIGATIONS

The responsibility to protect the territorial

and institutional integrity of the United States falls

squarely upon the shoulders of the Federal Government.

To effectively fulfill this responsibility, the

Government must acquire information to reach intelligent

decisions in the field of foreign affairs. This

information is also of vital importance when countering

the activities of foreign powers and their agents in the

United States.

With regard to efforts to obtain this •

information, we should inquire whether the President,

acting through the Attorney General, may authorize

an agency of the Federal Government to utilize

unusual investigative techniques such as wiretaps,

microphones and surreptitious entries without a

court order.

The resolution of this question requires

consideration of the relationship between Piesidential

power and national security on the one hand, and

the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment on

the other. Let us look at the two sides of this

relationship.

PRESIDENTIAL POWER

AND NATIONAL SECURITY

Alexander llamilton wrote that men could

differ regarding the creation of a Federal Government,

but that once such a Government was created and

made responsible for the defense of the nation, it

Inust be given the authority necessary to discharge

that responsibility. Hamilton recognized that

"the circumstances that endanger the safety of

nations are infinite," and for this reason, he wrote,

no limits should be placed on the Government's

authority in this area.

The Federalist, No. 23

(H. Lodge ed. 1888) at 123.

Numerous decisions of the United States

Supreme Court, moreover, have indicated that the

President, as Chief Executive, possesses powers

in foreign and military affairs which are not

dependent on a specific legislative grant, but

derive

from the Constitution itself. These

decisions have also indicated that the Court holds

great respect for these powers and that only with

extreme care will it interfere with them.

:

## Page 205

In Marbury V. Madison, 1 Cranch (5 U.S.)

137 (1803), the court commented: "By the

Constitution... the President is invested with

certain political powers, in the exercise of which

he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable

only to his country in his political character, and

to his own conscience." Id. at 165-166. In 1863,

the supreme Court in the Prize Cases, 67 U.S.

(2 Black) 635, went on to uphold the President's

authority to blockade insurrectionary Southern

ports without Corgressional authorization. In

1915, the Supreme Court, in Mackenzie v. Hare,

239 U.S. 299, explained that the Federal judiciary

should be slow to curtail such powers.

In United States v. Curtiss-Wright

Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, decided by the supreme

Court in 1936, the Court again commented upon the

president's

powers in the area of foreign affairs.

The Court explained that there is a significant

difference between the conduct of domestic, as •

opposed to foreign affairs, and stated that the

Government's powers in the area of internal affairs

are limited to those specifically enumerated in the

Constitution. In the area of foreign affairs,

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 - Page 205

---

## Page 206

!

-=

however, the powers of the Government are not

limited to those set forth in the Constitution.

If not expressly set forth in that document, the

Court wrote, the Government, as an attribute of

sovereignty, would still have the power "to declare

and wage war" and "to maintain diplomatic relations."

Id.

at 318.

The Court in Curtiss-Wright, discussing

the sensitive nature of foreign diplomacy and the

need

for secrecy, wrote that, if the nation is to

be successful in its foreign relations, the executive

branch must be afforded greater flexibility than it

is permitted in the area of domestic affairs. The

• President, not Congress, the Court reasoned, is in

a better position to be knowledgeable regarding

conditions in foreign countries. "Secrecy in

respect of information gathered by [Presidential

sources

and agents] may be highly necessary, and

the

premature disclosure of it productive of harmful

results."

Id. at 320.

The Supreme Court in Hirabayashi Y.

United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), went on to

state that the President's

"war power" is "the

power to wage war successfully" and held that the

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 206

---

## Page 207

power extended "to every matter and

activity so

related to war as

substantially to affect its credit

and progress."

The Court went on to say that the

Constitution has given to the President great

latitude in determining the nature and extent of

the danger to the nation and the means to resist it.

Regarding the judiciary's iole in this area, the

Court again emphasized that it would interfere with

the President's power in this area only with extreme

care.

Id. at 93.

In 1948, the Supreme Court in Chicago and

Southern Airlines, Inc. V. Waterman Corp., 333 U.S.

103, reaffirmed and elaborated on its earlier holding

in Curtiss-Wright. The Court in Waterman again

held that the President is empowered to act with

broad freedom and secrecy in the conduct of foreign

relations and that the judiciary should not interfere

with Presidential power in this area. Commenting on

the sensitive nature of foreign affairs and

the

judiciary's role in this area, the Court said:

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667

Page 207

---

## Page 208

"The President . . . has available

intelligence services whose reports

are not and ought not to be published

to the world.

It would be intolerable

that courts without the relevant

information should review and perhaps

nullify actions of the Executive

taken on information properly held

secret.

Nor can courts sit in camera

in order to be taken into executive

confidences.

But even it courts

could acquiro iull. disclosure,

the

very nature of executive decisions

as to foreign policy is political,

not judicial.

such decisions are

wholly confided by our Constitution

to the political department . ..

They are delicate, complex and

involve large elements of prophecy

They are decisions of a kind

for which the Judiciary has neither

aptitude, facilities, nor responsi-

bilities and which has long been held

to belong in the domain of political

pover not subject to judicial

intrusion or inquiry . ..."

Id.

at 111.

The Congress has also recognized that the

President has certain powers in the area of foreign

affairs.

Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and

Safe Streets Act, 18 United States Code, Sections 2510-

2520, authorizes the use of electronic surveillance

for certain crimes. Along with the surveillance

provisions in the Act, there is the following proviso:

$55*

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 208

## Page 209

"Nothing contained in this

chapter .

•• shall limit the con-

stitutional power of the President

to take such measures as he deems

necessaty to protect the, Nation

against actual or potential attack

or other hostile acts of a foreian

power, to obtain toreran intelligence

intormation deemed essential to

the security of the United States,

or to protect national. security

information aquirst sereion in

telligence activities."

18 United

States Code, Section

2511(3) •

THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT

Beyond the question of presidential power

and national security an additional consideration

in this area is the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution,

which specifies:

"The right of the people to

be secure in their persons, houses,

papers, and effects, against un~

reasonable searches

and seizures,

shall not be violated, and no

Warrants shall issue, but upon

probable cause, supported by

Oath or affirmation, and parti-

cularly describing the place

to be searched, and the persons

or things to be seized."

The question is raised: Fass the Fourth Amendment's

warrant requirement prohibit the President, acting

without a court order,

from authorizing an agency of

MW 55256

DocId: 32989667 Page 209

---

## Page 210

the Federal Government to utilize clectronic

surveillances and physical entries in the foreign

intelligence arca?

By way of background, prior to 1967, the

Supreme Court decided the legality of electronic

surveillance by determining whether or not a trespass

was involved; the Fourth Amendment was violated oniy

if at the time of the installation there was a trespass

on the premises. With the Katz case in 1957, however,

(389 U.S.

347) the Court stated the Fourth Amendment

protects people, not places, and abolished the

trespassory distinction. It held that oral communications

were protected

from unreasonable surveillance by the

Fourth Amendment

and that the mandate of this Amendment

required adherence to judicial process.

Intentionally left open in Katz was the

question of whether safeguards other than prior

authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourch

Amendment in a

situation involving national security.

The issue unresolved in Katz was partially faced by the

Supreme Court in the Keith decision, 407 U.S, 297

(1972).

There the Supreme Court held that electronic

surveillances in the domestic security area conducted

solely within the discretion of the Executive violated

NW 55256

DocId: 32989667

Page 210

---

## Page 211

the

warrant requirement of the Fourch Amendment.

The

Court emphasized the case involved only the domestic

aspects of national security. "We have not addressed,

and express no opinion as to, the issues which may be

involved with respect to activities of foreign powers

or their

agents."

407 U.S. at 321, 322.

Thus,

the Supreme Court reserved judgment

relative to the question of whether a warrantless

electronic surveillance directed against foreign powers

violated the Fourth Amendment. Every lower Federal

court that has faced the question, however, has stated

the President may constitutionally authorize warrantless

wiretaps when foreign powers are involved. United States

• Y. Clay, 430 F. 2d 165 (5th Cir. 1970); United States

V. Brown, 484 F. 2d 418 (5th Cir. 1973) ; United States

V. Butenko, 494 F. 2d 593 (3d Cir, 1974); Zweihon

nation from possibile foreign encroachment, whether

in its existence as a nation or in its intercourse

with other nations." 484 F 2d at 426.

We may then inquire whether the President

has the authority to authorize a warrantless physical

entry directed against foreign powers. In United States

V. Ehrlichman, 376 F. Supp. 29 (D.D.C. 1974), a

criminal prosecution for conspiring to violate Title '18,

United States Code, Section 241, and thus injure a

citizen in the enjoyment of Fourth Amendment rights,

the Special Prosecutor asserted that the President,

acting through the Attorney General, does not have the

authority to authorize the installation of a warrantless,

trespassory microphone. The court agreed, It reasoned

that the President does not have the authority to

suspend the requirement of the fourth Amendment and

stated that the Government must comply with strict

constitutional limitations on trespassory searches even

when known foreign agents are involved. Id. at 33.

But these comments, while they should be

given consideration, do not declare a conclusion of

law reached by the court as to the legal effect of the

facts revealed. They are dictum, merely the opinions

of one juage. In fact, no court has held that the

NW 55256 DocId:32989667 Page 212

---

## Page 213

:

President may not authorize a surreptitious entry

directed against foreign powers. Thus, in our view

the question is an open one, and we feel that a

strong argument can be made supporting the President's

authority in this area.

Note that the Fourth Amendment is concerned

with searches and seizures, not trespasses per se and

that both the interception of oral communications and

a surreptitious

entry constitute significant intrusions

upon interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. Thus,

if the President has the authority to authorize warrantless

electronic surveillance against foreign powers it would

appear that he could constitutionally authorize a

surreptitious entry against 'foreign powers. Of course,

the court in United States v. Ehrlichman, supra,

commenting on recent lower Federal court cases which

stated the President may constitutionally authorize

warrantless electronic surveillance against foreign

powers, characterized wiretapping as a "relatively

nonobtrusive

search."' 376 F. Supp. at 33. But.

wiretapping is an intrusion that can last

for an

indefinite period and is all-pervasive, while the

intrusion connected with a physical entry is of

NW 55256

DocId: 32989667

Page 213

---

## Page 214

relatively short duration and is usually directed

toward a specific objective. Thus, it would appear

that where the objective of an entry is simply to

create the circumstances

for nonitoring it is

actually less obtrusive than wiretapping. Where

the objective of the entry is to conduct a physical

search the gap may be narrower and depending

on the circumstances may approach wiretapping

in obtrusiveness.

:

CONCLUSION

Numerous decisions of the United States

Supreme Court have recognized that the President,

as Chief Executive, possesses powers in foreign

and military affairs which are not dependent on

specific legislative grant but which derive from

the Constitution itself. Every lower Federal court

that has faced the question has stated the President

may constitutionally authorize warrantless wiretaps

when foreign powers are involved. In a recent Fifth

Circuit case,

for example, the court commented,

"Restrictions upon the President's power which are

appropriate in cases of domestic security become

artificial in the context of the international

sphere." No court has held that the President

..x.

may not authorize a surreptitious entry directed

against foreign powers, ard a strong argument can

be made to support the President's authority in

:

this area.

Thus, it appears that the President,

acting through the Attorney General, may authorize

a Federal agency to utilize unusual investigative

techniques in foreign intelligence investigations.

ACCESS TO RECORDS MAINTAINED

BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS

DATE: 3/19/75

ATTENTION: PRINCIPAL

LEGAL INSTRUCTOR

Re SAC Memorandum 5-72 dated 6/13/7%, and Bureau letter

to Albany, and all field offices, dated 9/14/72, captioned as above.

The following discussion is being offered to inform the field

of recent legal trends which may atfect our investigative efforts when

access to banking records is contemplated. The general thrust of

referenced communications was that no constitutional inhibitions existed

to prohibit reasonable inspections of financial records by the Government

and that usually no subpoena was necessary. Subsequent challenges to

this position on First and Fifth Amendment grounds have been rejected

by the courts. However, several recent lower court decisions indicate

that a judicial reexamination of this area in light of a changing inter-

pretation of the Fourth Amendment may be developing, As will be seen,

the Supreme Court has not yet furnished a definitive statement of its

views on the matter.

A 1973 decision in the Second Circuit addressed itself to

First Amendment problems surrounding this issue of governmental

access to bank records. Flith Avenue Peace Parade Committee v.

Gray, 480 F, 2d 326 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied 415 U.S.

848 (1973),

was a case in which antiwar demonstrators claimed FBI review of

their organization's bank records had a chilling effect on the exercise

of their First Amendment rights.

The court, however, affirmed the

dismissal of the complaint and held that the plaintiffs failed to present

a justiciable controversy as they could show no specific harm, real or

threatened, from the FBI Agent's warrantless inspection of the account.

Re: Access to Records Maintained

By Banking Institutions

It should be noted, however, that there was a vigorous dissent in this

case and perhaps a contrary holding would have been reached had the

plaintiffs been able to prove a real or potential injury resulting from

the FBI's activity.

A recent Supreme Court decision seems to dispose of any

Fifth Amendment barrier. Couch v. United States, 409 U.S. 322 (1973),

involved an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) summons directed to the

defendant's accountant ordering him to furnish the Government the

defendant's business records which the accountant possessed. Defendant

intervened invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-

incrimination. In affirming the validity of the district court's order

enforcing the summons, the Supreme Court held that the defendant's

Fifth Amendment rights were not violated even though she owned the

documents sought by the Government. The Fifth Amendment only

protects a defendant from being "

• . . compelled in any criminal

case to be a witness against himself...." Here the compuision

was on the accountant, not the defendant, and the Fifth Amendment

does not proscribe incriminating statements elicited from another.

The analogy to bank records would seem to be that if the Government

required a bank to produce a depositor's records, the depositor could

not raise a Fifth Amendment objection inasmuch as the "compulsion"

to produce the records would be on the bank, not the depositor.

With regard to Fourth Amendment concerns, the referenced

communications suggested that subpoenas or other judicial processes

were unnecessary as a depositor was considered to have no proprietary

interest in the bank records and thus had no standing to object on Fourth

Amendment grounds. Once a check was honored at a bank it became the

bank's property and the defendant lost all legal interest in it. United

States v. Gerhart, 275 F. Supp. 443 (S. D.W. Va. 1967); United States v.

Gross,

416 F. 2d 1205 (8th Cir. 1969). The property theory of Fourth

Amendment protection, however, was expressly abandoned by the

(1967), held that the

.. . premise that property interests control

the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited. "

389 U.S. 347, 353. Rather, ". . . the Fourth Amendment protects

peopie, not places." 389 U.S. 347, 351. The Government may conduct

an unreasonable search if it invades an area in which a defendant has a

- 2 -

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 217

## Page 218

Re: Access to Records Maintained

By Banking Institutions

justifiable expectation of privacy, regardless of whether he maintains a

property interest in the area searched or item seized. ". . . (W)hat he

seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public

may be constitutionally protected. " 389 U.S. 347, 351, 352.

The constitutional issues, then, are twofold: 1) Does a

depositor have a justifiable expectation of privacy in bank records

pertaining to his account, making an inspection of those records by

law enforcement personnel a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth

Amendment? And 2), if he does, is a judicial order, i.e., subpoena,

summons, or search warrant required to make the search reasonable?

Several recent state and Federal decisions have addressed

themselves, either directly or indirectly, to these issues. The latest

is Burrows v. Superior Court, 16 CrI. 2320 (Cal. Sup. Ct. 12/27/74).

Burrows, an attorney, was suspected by local anthorities of

misappropriating the funds of a client. Several California banks in which

he maintained accounts were contacted by a detective resulting in at least

one bank giving the officer photocopies of defendant's bank statements.

The defendant sought to suppress the damaging evidence contained in

the bank records on the ground it was obtained in violation of the search

and seizure clause of the California constitution, the wording of which

is substantially the same as that found in the Fourth Amendment.

The

California Supreme Court ruled that Burrows held a". . . reasonable

expectation, that, absent compulsion by legal process, the maiters

he reveals to the bank will be utilized by the bank only for internal

banking purposes." Id. at 2320. Lacking a subpoena, warrant, or

other form of legal process, the seizure of the bank statements was

unreasonable and the state was prohibited from using them at the

defendant's trial.

Several important principles are evident from a reading of

this decision. First, the holding rests not on an interpretation of the

Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution but rather upon the

search and seizure clause (article I, section 13) of the constitution of

the State of California. This means

that bank records abtained without

legal process may be excluded only in state prosecutions, not Federal

;

cases.

A state court's construction of its own state constitution is not

binding on the action of Federal officers whose conduct is measured

against the salient provisions of the Federal Constitution. Thus, absent

a Federal decision to the contrary, an FBI Agent may obtain, without

benefit of subpoena, information from a suspect's bank account in

California and legally have it introduced into evidence at a criminal

trial conducted in a U. S. District Court in California. Nevertheless,

the practical impact of this decision on the Bureau's investigative

activities in that state is potentially great. It is foreseeable that a

bank, which could not furnish depositor information to state officials

without a valid judicial order, would be highly reluctant to give the

same information to the officials' Federal counterparts who possessed

no subpoena or warrant regardless of the fact that the Federal agents

were under no legal obligation to have obtained one.

Because of the strong likelihood that Agents in California who

are working cases which necessitate examination of banking records will

be met by requests for subpoenas, it is suggested that they familiarize

themselves with the provisions of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,

rule 17 (c), which governs the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum.

A second important principle reflected in the Burrows decision

concerns the scope of protection the court afforded the depositor under

the aegis of his justifiable expectation of privacy. The case held that

not only was a judicial order required to obtain copies of documents

furnished the bank by the depositor, i.e., checks, deposit slips, etc.,

but also for the production of bank statements prepared by the financial

institution itself and intended primarily for use by the bank. "Thus, we

hold petitioner had a reasonable expectation that the bank would maintain

the confidentiality of those papers which originated with him in check

form and of the bank statements into which a record of those same checks

had been transformed pursuant to internal bank practice." Burrows,

supra, at 2320, 2321. Although the decision only concerned bank

statements, it seems a logical extension of the court's reasoring to

apply the "justifiable expectation of privacy" theory to signature cards

and other written instruments prepared by a depositor in order to utilize

the services of the bank. In addition, the practice of law enforcement

officials of routinely contacting banks when investigating nonsufficient

fund checks will have to be curtailed unless a subpoena or other form

of legal process is obtained. The court also indicated it was prepared

to extend the protection to bonds, loan applications, loan guarantees,

and other papers utilized by a bank customer in conducting his financial

attairs.

As the court itself phrased the issue, the decision is limited

to a consideration of whether defendant's rights were violated".., in

optaining, without benerit of legal process

a bank in which he maintained an account, i comes z8so, phs Eron

added). It would appear, then, that no legal restriction exists to a

review of records relevant to proving a criminal violation on a.

defendant it he does not maintain an account at the bank where the

records are reviewed.

Examples would be examining suspicious

checks drawn on another institution and presented to such a bank for

cashing by a suspect or checking stolen money orders already cashed

by a suspect and being held by the issuing bank. In addition, the

exclusionary principle ot the Burrows case apparently applies only

to ofticial Government conduct, not to inquiries by private entities

such as department stores, etc.

A third significant aspect of the decision is the court's

rejection of traditional warrant exceptions to sustain the search.

Specifically, consent by the bank could not make the search legal.

"The voluntary relinquishment of such records by the bank at the

request of the police does not constitute a valid consent by this

petitioner." Id. at 2321. Arguably, consent from the depositor

himself would suffice. The thrust of the opinion, then, is that it

the officer seeking to review a depositor's bank records acts without

the benefit of legal process or the depositor's consent, his search of

those records is illegal under the California constitution and any seizure

of information is unreasonable rendering it inadmissible at a state trial.

Two other recent cases, one Federal and the other state,

furnish additional input on these issues. In United States v. Miller,

400 F. 2d 751 (5th Cir. 1974), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Fire-

arms (ATF) Agents investigated a case involving a nonregistered

still and possession of non-tax-paid whiskey. In furtherance of their

By Banking Institutions

investigation they received subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney

which were used to obtain microfilm copies of the defendant's bank

checks. The checks were introduced at Miller's trial and he was

convicted. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit determined that the subpoenas

were improperly obtained in that they were issued by the United States

Attorney rather than by a court, there was no return made upon them

to the court, and they were issued for a date when the grand jury was

not in session. Obtaining the checks by use of the faulty subpoenas,

therefore,".. constituted an unlawiul invasion of Miller's privacy,

and... any evidence so obtained should have been suppressed."

Idl. at 756.. Miller's conviction was reversed.

In Sheriff of Lander County V. Nevada National Bank, 518

P. 2d 602 (Nev. 1974), a county sheriff obtained a search warrant to

search the bank records of three depositors in connection with an

investigation of alleged misappropriation of county funds.

The bank

was unwilling to comply with the warrant and sought to enjoin its

execution. The Supreme Court of Nevada affirmed the lower court's

order issuing the injunction and stated that the warrant was invalid

because it did not particularly describe the items sought and contained

insufficient probable cause. It authorized nothing more than a 'fishing

expedition."

The significance of these decisions, especially the Miller

case, is apparent. They suggest that a depositor, at least in the

jurisdictions of these courts, enjoys Fourth Amendment protection

in his bank records and only a subpoena or warrant, properly issued,

will permit a law officer to make an inspection of them.

Even it it is

ultimately determined that the Fourth Amendment affords no constitutional

protection to a depositor's bank records, if judicial process is invoked

to obtain financial information it must be used properly.

Other recent cases are contrary to the holdings discussed

above. For example, in Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee v.

Gray,.

supra, the court noted "(the specific activity of.. (the FBI

Agent) . . .

by no means rose to the level of a constitutional invasion

of privacy.

" 480 F. 2d 326, 332. The issue has not yet been resolved

specifically by the Supreme Court. That Court has, however, held that

evade a proper legal summons for the financial records of a depositor

under investigation, First National Bank v. United States, 267 U.S.

576 (1925); and that a depositor suffers no Fourth Amendment violation

when a bank produces information from his account pursuant to a

lawfully issued summons. Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517

(1971). But the question of the assertion of that right by a depositor

when no legal process has been obtained is still open. Some insight

can be gained by a brief review of California Bankers Association v.

Shultz, 39 I. Ed. 2d 812 (1974), in which the court upheld the consti-

tutionality of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970. (12 USCS 3$ 1829b, 1730d,

1951-1959; 31 USCS $§ 1051-1122).

The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 was passed following a

congressional determination that foreign and domestic bank records

of customers thought to be engaged in illegal activities were generally

unavailable. Its purpose was to obtain financial information having

"a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations

or proceedings. " The Act and the implementing regulations of the

Secretary of the Treasury require banks to maintain recoras of their

customers' identities, to keep copies of checks, and record certain

other items. In addition to these recordkeeping duties the reporting

provisions require that the banks file a report with the IRs on each

domestic transaction involving currency exceeding $10, 000. That

report is to include the identity of the person conducting the transaction,

of the person for whom it was conductea, and a description of the

transaction.

In Shultz, the court saw no Fourth Amendment violation in

the recordkeeping provision. The Act does not require the banks to

furnish the information to the Government, only to maintain it. "(B)oth

the legislative history and the regulations

make specific reference to the

fact that access to the records is to be controlled by existing legal

process." 39 L. Ed. 2d 812, 835 (emphasis added). The clear inference.

of this passage is that if the Government desires to obtain information

from banks that they are required to maintain under the Act, (customer's

identity, copies of checks, etc.) it must conform to "existing legal

process." "Legal process" would appear to mean a judicial order,

Re: Access to. Records Maintained

By Banking Institutions

subpoena, summons, etc. It would be only speculation to assert that legal

process is not required to obtain other financial intormation not required

to be maintained under the Act.

A review of the legislative history of the Bank Secrecy Act,

P. I. 91-508, referred to by the court, reveals that it was the intention

of the drafters that the records required to be maintained would be

confidential. With regard to the recordkeeping provisions, the congres-

sional finding was that "there is nothing in this bill which would make

such records any more accessible to law enforcement officers . . . than

they now are." 2 U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News 4400, 1970. Again,

with reference to these provisions, the legislative history states that

the records "

.. . will not be made automatically available for law

enforcement purposes. They can only be obtained through existing

legal process." 2 U.S. Code Cong. and Ad, News, supra, p. 4395.

With regard to the domestic reporting provisions of the Act,

the court held that the banks suffered no Fourth Amendment violation

but did not reach this issue with respect to the depositors.

Because

none of the depositor plaintifis in Shultz engaged in transactions involving

more than $10, 000 in currency (the only transactions banks are required

to report) they lacked standing to challenge the reporting regulations on

Fourth Amendment grounds.

Thus the crucial issue of whether a depositor

can challenge the Government's warrantless inspection of his financial

records as being violative of his Fourth Amendment rights was specifically

left open by the Supreme Court. The Court's recent decision in United

States v. Bisceglia, 43 L. W. 3242 (3/18/15), does nothing to resolve

this issue. Bisceglia merely involved an interpretation of a Federal

statute which empowers IRS Agents to issue administrative summonses

for records (in this case, bank records) which might aid in determining

an individual's tax liability. That procedure, which the court upheld,

was objected to by the bank, not a depositor, and did not present

constitutional considerations.

Another potential factor affecting the Bureau's work in this

area is H. R. 1005, a bill entitied "Right to Financial Privacy Act of

1975, " introduced into the House of Representatives on 1/14,75. This

bill, if passed, would recognize a confidential relationship between a

depositor and a banking institution and permit access to the financial

Re: Access to Records Maintained

By Banking Institutions

records by law enforcement in one of only four ways. Consent of the

depositor, good for three months, would be permitted, as would an

administrative summons or subpoena, a judicial subpoena, or search

warrant. Concerning the latter three, both the bank and the customer

would be served, with the provision that the depositor could move to

quash the subpoena or enjoin execution of the warrant. The ultimate

fate of the bill, of course, is unknown at this time; however, it should

be observed that at least five other similar bills were introduced into

Congress in 1972-1973 and none have yet been enacted.

It is foreseeable then, that because of the legislative history

of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Supreme Court's discussion in the

Shule case of that history, pending legislation in Congress, and the

recent trend of the lower courts, it is likely the Bureau will be

confronted with more frequent requests for subpoenas when seeking

review of bank depositors' accounts. Because of this distinct

possibility, a brief review of procedures governing the Bureau's

access to records subpoenaed by a Federal grand jury seems

perlinent.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 (e) prohibits disclosure of matters

occurring before the grand jury and maintains that its proceedings

are secret. This raises the question of the Bureau's access to records

subpoenaed by that body. Concerning this issue the courts have held

that "when the document sought is sought for itself independently rather

than because it was displayed to the grand jury, there is no bar of

secrecy, " Commonwealth Edison Co. V. Allis-Chalmers Mig. Co.,

211 F. Supp. 729, 734 (N. D. IIi, 1962), and that Rule 6 (e)"... is

intended only to protect against disclosure of what is said or what

takes place in the grand jury room. " United States v. Interstate

Press Carriers, Inc., 280 F. 2d 52, 54 (2d Cir. 1960). It would seem,

then, that the secrecy intended by Rule 6 (e) would not bar FBI review

of subpoenaed grand jury documents.

Many jurisdictions, however,

require that the United States Attorney obtain an order from the district

court judge directing him to make the subpoenaed documents available

to the investigative agency before they will be released. See United

States v. Interstate Press Carriers, Inc., supra; In Re July 3973 Grand

Jury, 374 F. Supp., 1334 (N. D. III.

1973). Agents having matters which

HERKIN IS UNC

DATE

As you are aware, by letter to the Director dated 1/27/75,

Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Republican Leader Hugh Scott /

advised of the Senate's investigation and study of Government operations

with respect to intelligence activities. Senators Mansfield and Scott

requested the Bureau not to destroy, remove from our possession or

control, or otherwise dispose or permit the disposal of any records or

documents which might have a bearing on subjects under investigation

by the Senate. Accordingly, pending further clarification, the Identifica-

tion Division ceased all previously approved records management finger-

print destruction programs. These fingerprint destruction programs,

previously approved by the Archivist of the United States, related to the

destruction of civil fingerprint cards of persons 75 years of age and older

and criminal fingerprint cards of persons 80 years of age and older.

Purpose of this memorandum is to request that Office of

Congressional Affairs, Legal Counsel Division, through appropriate

contact in the United States Senate determine if the above request

contamed in letter of 1/27/75, was intended to include the records

management fingerprint destruction programs further described below.

By way of background, with the concurrence of the Attorney

General, the Department of Defense, the Civil Service Commission, the

Immigration and Naturalization Service nd the Archivist of the United

States,

in 1970 we began a long-term project to consolidate and purge the

civil fingerprint file.

This project has been programmed into three phases

in order to utilize employees with varying experience ranging from

relatively new employees to those fully qualitied to classify and search

fingerprints.

Phase I and Phase Il called for a review of civil fingerprint

cards to locaie and destroy fingeryrint cards received in connection with

civilian national defense work during World War I and those civil finger-

prints of individuals fingerprinted for other reasons who have reached the

Memorandum Aish to Jenkins

RE: Fingerprint Purge Programs

Identification Division

age of 75 years. We have purged more than 52, 000, 000 civil fingerprint

cards in these two phases. Phase Ill involves the consolidation of the

remaining civil fingerprint cards in file of individuals less than 75 years

of age retaining one set of fingerprints and destroying duplicates.

Phase III,

which we have barely commenced, must be handled by experienced finger-

print technicians and is tedious and time consuming..

In 1973, with the approval of the Attorney General and the Archivist

of the United States we instituted a records management fingerprint purge

program to dispose of arrest fingerprint cards and related records

maintained by the Identification Division on individuals 80 years of age and

older in accordance with Public Law 91-287. The Identification Division

no longer retains arrest fingerprint cards of individuals meeting this age

criteria. Through this records management criminal fingerprint purge

program we have purged and destroyed more than 1, 500, 000 arrest

fingerprint cards and related name index cards.

These purge programs have been invaluable in gaining valuable

file space necessary to meet our growth demands in both the civil and

criminal fingerprint files. For example, current additions to our civil

fingerprint file exceed 1, 000, 000 fingerprint cards each year and more

than 2, 000, 000 fingerprint cards to our criminal fingerprint file each

year.

Any fingerprint records system to remain cost effestive, efficient

and viable and make maximum utilization of available manpower and

space must be purged of inactive records that serve no useful purpose.

The vital records management fingerprint purge programs in the civil

and criminal fingerprint files of the Identification Division have been held

in abeyance since receipt of the above letter dated 1/27/75 from Senators

Mansfield and Scott. It is imperative that these vital programs be resumed

as soon as possible.

It would not appear that it was the intent of

Senators Mansfield and Scott to include our fingerprint purge programs

in their request as these records management fingerprint purge programs

do not relate to intelligence activities.

Portions of these doca-

Those documents which are followed by an asterisk on this

list do not appear to be classified, but are nonetheless

included because their contents are similar in nature to

those documents which are classified.

These documents should be declassified by

for the mail hearings, which are now scheduled to begin

on Tuesday, October 21.

Dear Mike:

Several of the documents supplied to the

Committee by the Bureau in connection with the Martin

Luther King

matter contain the conclusionary statement

that at various times in 1962 and 1963, Stanley Daviã

Levison was "a concealed member of the

• Communist Party

USA. "

Some examples of such documents are listed on

the attached sheet. I would appreciate your having the

Bureau supply the supporting evidence which existed for each

of those conclusions as of the date of the documents listed

or, where appropriate, as of the date cited in the docu-

ment itself.

We have noted that one of the documents which

has

been received appears to supply some indication of

how at least one of these conclusionary statements about

Levison was

arrived at.

That document is a memorandum from

the Director to

the Attorney General, dated September 4,

1963, captioned "Martin Luther King, JI., Security Matter-C"

which contains the following statement:

A source who has furnished reliable information

in the past advised in July 1963, that Stanley

Levison is a secret member of the Communist

Party, USA (CPUSA), and contributes funds to

211529 CPusA on a regular basis.

Robert Kelly,

Staff Member in charge of these particular

hearings, stated on 10/14/75 that these

hearings will be only one day which will be

12/4/75 and will involve the testimony of

lone or two surfaced informants followea by

a Bureau official testifying concerning the

Bureau's informant policy.

The FBI's relationship with other law en-

forcement agencies. This hearing will in

general discuss the exchange of information

between the Bureau and local and other

Federal law enforcement agencies. Addi-

tionally, there will be discussion at this

hearing concerning the Bureau's investigative

procedures.

Political uses of the FBI. (Former

Assistant to the Director Cartha DeLoach

is tentatively slated to be the main

witness.)

Elliff stated they have not set an exact date but they

will have the Attorney General and the Director appear at the

same time before the Comnittee to discuss problems of the future

involving the FBI. Elliff explained that they did not anticipate

having the Director testify before that Committee prior to the

aforementioned hearing and preferred to deal with current and

former officials who were involved in the above topics. Elliff

also stated that there was some consideration given to having

the Director participate in the session before the Committee to

discuss national security electronic surveillance. He indicated

this was tentative as there was some discussion by the Committee

as to whether to make it a strictly legal discussion in which the

Attorney General and/or Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General

in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel, would be present.

represent Bureau personnel.

MT .

David J. Anderson, Civil

Division, discussed the proposed testimony with shackelford

and Rachner and

accompanied them

Shackelford and Rachner appeared as instructed at

3:00 p.m., 2/25/75, with Anderson.

At approximately 3:30 p.m.,

Arthur Harrigan, staff member of the Committee, appeared at

the reception area and escorted us to a nearby

former hotel

where the statements were to be taken.

Present for taking

of the statement on behalf of the Committee were Harrigan,

Barbara Banott, a recording machine operator and Mark

Gitenstein. A minority counsel representative, name

unrecalled, was also present for a short period.

Shackelford and Rachner were not placed under

oath; however, their rights were read to them and a waiver

was presented

for signature. At this time, Anderson advised

he was present on behalf of the Government, not to represent

Shackelford and Rachner. Shackelford insisted the waiver

form so stipulate, as to limitation of counsel, which was

done, and waivers

were signed.

Upon request, Rachner related the mechanics of the

Bureau's liaison with

IRS and, specifically, means used to

obtain income tax forms.

Shackelford was asked to agree to the accuracy of

lengthy passages read from the various FBI documents in their

possession, which was done. Objections were raised by

Shackelford to this laborious and time-consuming process,

pointing out, with Anderson's concurrence, the FBI would

stipulate to

the contents of the documents. Harrigan, alter

considerable discussion, then agreed to try to summarize and

speed up the process, which was done. Documents Involve

concerned: 1) Robert Marvin Shelton (Klan 1965): 2) Roya

Virgil Young, Sr., James R. Venable, Jason Edgar Kersey,

Calvin Fred Craig,

Samuel Holloway Bowers, Jr., Robert Echols

Scoggins (Klan 1965); 3) Robert Marvin Shelton, United Klans

O1 America,

(1970), Betty Mae Smith (CPUSA 1969), Bradford Bingham (CPUSA

1965), Sidney Morris Peck (SM 1968), and Edward R. Mull

in the package of documents which were not discussed.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: SENSTUDY - 75

In terminating the interview, Gitenstein requested

that Shackelford and Rachner agree, on

the record,

to notify

the Committee 24 hours in advance of any additional infor-

mation which they might use in open testimony Tuesday, 9/30/75,

concerning the matters discussed. Shackelford told Gitenstein

this was an unreasonable and unfair request inasmuch as the

statement taken had been restricted to a recitation of our

liaison with Inv, the mechanics of obtaining tax returns and

virtually a statement oi agreement as to the accuracy oI

Harrigan's reading of the COINTELPRO documents.

It was

explained there was no way of anticipating questions raised

and answers of necessity would inject new material by Bureau

personnel. Gitenstein then agreed to a proposal that Bureau

personnel would advise of any factual change desired as to

answers given in the course of the statement upon review of the

transcript.

Rachner requested Gitenstein to agree to advise

the Bureau

24 hours in advance of hearing as to any new line

of questioning or specific inquiring outside of the statement

taken, to which Gitenstein agreed.

Anderson concurred with

these

agreements. Gitenstein advised Bureau personnel would

be expected to testify in open hearings Tuesday, 9/30/75.

OBSERVATIONS

Bearing in mind the hearings on 9/30/75 involve IRS,

it is expected testimony of Bureau personnel will be used in

an effort to establish methods used to obtain IRS income tax

returns under Section 6103 of IRS Code of 1954 and alleged

FBI misuse of this information for COINTELPRO purposes.

FBI

documents in the possession of the Committee speak for them-

selves and are expected to constitute the primary eltort of

the Committee regarding the FBI's relationship with IRS. It

can also be expected that comments will be solicited from

Bureau personnel as to the propriety of the various requests

and subsequent use of tax information.

The matter of being afforded legal counsel by the

Department does not appear to/fully resolved and needs to be

chest

My memorandum of 9/26/75 disclosed details of

depositions given by Section Chief R. I. Shackelford

and Liaison Officer B. C. Rachner to the staff of Senate

Select Committee concerning the Bureau's relationship with

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in preparation for testimony

on 9/30/75. This is to advise this segment of the IRS

hearings has been cancelled.

BACKGROUND

Referenced memorandum related an agreement

extracted from the staff that they would furnish 24 hours

in advance any new subject matter or line of inquiry intended

for utilization during scheduled hearings. During the

morning of 9/29/75 John T. Elliff, Director of the staff,

advised he intended to inject the matter of the Bureau

having obtained Martin Luther King and Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) tax returns and suggested

(by Atlanta) Counterintelligence Program utilization of them.

He also advised he intended to broaden the inquiry into our

obtaining the tax returns of Sidney M. Peck to include his

being a Key Activist and relate this to the proposed Counter-

intelligence Program use of the tax returns.

It was vigorously pointed out to Elliff by personnel

trying to locate documents that would resolve whether the

R. Wannall

suggested counterintelligence usage of King's returns,

and those of SCLC, was implemented, it was a monumental

job to go through the extremely voluminous material

to accomplish this and certainly little time would remain

for their study by staff or Bureau personnel involved in

the hearings.

Shackelford also pointed out the injection of new

material was not within the 24-hour agreement.

stated he realized this but felt both issues raised would

be focal points of testimony because both persons were well

known.

He added that in absence of the document disclosing

whether the proposed counterintelligence usage of King and

SCLC's returns was implemented, he would have reference made

to the fact they were requested and obtained, but the matter

would be dealt with during subsequent hearings.

Shackelford told Elliff this would be a totally

unfair presentation as to King as it would imply wrongdoing

without full discussion and background justification and

it left a clear implication the counterintelligence action

was taken. Elliff was told that if this course of action

was followed it would be vigorously protested during the

course of the hearings, as would his attempt to equate the

Key Activist Program with the Counterintelligence Program.

No agreement was reached.

Subsequently, Shackelford and Rachner met with

Mark Gitenstein of the staff to review the transcript of

their deposition. Gitenstein engaged Shackelford in dis-

cussion concerning the previous conversation with Ellift.

Gitenstein was advised of the factual reasons for the strong

objections of Shackelford and that if they chose to proceed,

vigorous objections would be raised during the open hearings

by Shackelford.

Gitenstein said he would try to have the

matter of Peck's being a Key Activist covered in the initial

comments being prepared for senator Joseph M. Montoya (N. M.)

without counterintelligence connotations. He was advised

Peck's previous status as a Key Activist was not relative

IRS hearings and any unfair implication made would

Ibe vigorously protested. Again, no asleement was reached.

On the evening of 9/29/75 we were advised the hearings

were being rescheduled IOr 10/1/75.

Purpose of this memble (SirAn

Senator Schweiker, a member of the U. S.

of the U. S. Government, stated, according to a United Press

International release dated 9/28/15 (copy attached),

"In 1965

of every five members of the Ku Klux Klan was a paid FBI" (infor-

mant).

He called "that situation a dramatic example of unchecked

intelligence spending.

Our records show that in 1965 we estimated Klan member-

ship at slightly less than 10,000 and our informant coverage of

the Klan at that time numbered approximately 333.

Our records also

indicate that in addition to the approximately 333 informants

providing Klan coverage, there were 1,4/5 liaison sources in 1960

providing information regarding extremist and racial matters and

data concerning civil disturbances:

These liaison sources were,

for the most part, Negroes associated

with civil rights-type exope

whose interests were primarily in this field.

Their assistance

to us was to a large extent related to averting civil disturbance

situations.

By letter dated 9/2/65 (copy attached) we provided the

White House information regarding the FBI's role in the solution

of brulal murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi

and other matters in which the President may have an interest.

It was pointed out that nearly 2,000 of our informants and sources

were being operated to ohtain up-to-date intelligence data con-

cerning racial matters which we disseminated on a continuing

basis.

of Klan organizations. At that time there were 14 Klan gröups

in existence and we had penetrated everyone of them through

Intormants were operating in top-level positions

containing substantially the same information (copy attached)

was sent to the Attorney General.

Our operation of approximately 333 informants to provide

coverage of Klan activities in 1965 at the time when Klan member-

ship was estimated at slightly less than 10,000 statistically

indicates a 3.3 percent infiltration or one

to the Senator's statement of "one in five."" I reterencontrasted

nearly 2,000 of our informants and sources did not indicate these

individuals were providing information regarding Klan matters

exclusively. These informants and sources were being operated

to obtain up-to-date intelligence data concerning racial matters

generally.

Copies of the letters dated 9/2/65 to the White House

and the Attorney General were released 8/14/75 under the Freedom

of Information Act to Mr. Orr Kelly, Washington Star-News,

Washington, D. C.

and approximately 12 other newsmen. Although

a copy of

the 9/2/65 letter to the White House has been furnished

to the SSC, we do not know that Senator Schweiker has access to

it nor do we know the source of his information regarding Klan

membership figures. Undoubtedly, Senator Schwelker was utilizing

the figures 2,000 informants and

approximately 10,000 kLan

members when making reference to "one in five members of the. Ku

Klux Klan was a paid FBI" (informant).

In 1165, the Klan was involved not only in atrocities

such as the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi,

the murders of Viola Liuzzo and Col. Lemuel Penn, but was also

associated with numerous hombing incidents and other activities.

• Hi. Rosack

Dear AT. Watson:

As you know, this bureau has solved a number of cases

involving racial violence in the south. In this regard, publio

attention particularly was focused on the BI's role in the

solution of the brutal murders of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, Lieutenant.

Colonel Lenuel. A. Penn, and the three civil rights workers 11

Mississippi.

However, we have achieved a nunber of other tangible

accomplishments, most of which are not publicly known, and

thought the President night be interested in then

.....

At the present time, for example, nearly two thousandl

of our informants and sources are being operated to obtain

up-to-date intelligence data concerning racial matters vhich we

disseminate on a continuing basis. Of these, 174 have been

developed in just the pasi yearoan average of more than two each

day for every day In the past twelva months.

Particularly significant has been the high level

penetsation we bave achieved of Klan organizarions.

At the

present time, there are 14 Klan groups in existence. We have

penetrated every one of them through informants and cursently

are operating incormants in top level positions oi leadership i

seven of then.

Through such coverage, much valuable information

relating to a variety of cases of violence and planned violence

in the civil righis fiold has :been obtained.

Just recently,

for example,

an informant secured and furnishod to us the

weapon used in i civil rights shooting incident in North Carolina.

The solution to the series of bombings and burnings of sone 20

Klan organization in that state is our informant, and we have

had him varn every member of his organization that he will not

tolerate violence in any form. As & result, we have been

successful to date in holding Klan violence

12 the entire state

to an absolute mininum.

We also are seizing every opportunity to diszup

the activities of ilan organizations.

Typical is

the manner 10

which we exposed and thwarted

I have iurnished these examples to illustrate to the

At his request Deputy Associate Director, James B. Adams

and SA Paul V. Daly of this Division met with Deputy Attorney Gen-

eral Harold R. Tyler, Jr., on October. 3, 1975. Mr. Tyler advised

that he had shown former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach

the original Bureau memoranda captioned "Martin Luther King" dated

5/17/65, 10/19/65 and 12/12/65 pertaining to authorization for

microphone surveilance on Martin Luther King. He was also shown a

note daced 12/10/65 directed from him to Mr. Hoover with his initials

affixed at the bottom thereof. Mr. Tyler related that Katzenbach,

after reviewing the aforementioned documents, stated that it was

doubtful that he had approved the microphone surveillances contained

in the memoranda, although he admitted the initials looked like his

Katzenbach

advanced two arguments as to why he did not believe

he had approved the electronic surveillance requests.

(1) He stated the Martin Luther King investigation was

very controversial topic and he was very concerned about it.

ing to Mr. Tyler, Katzenbach stated he was so concerned about this

matter that he had discussed it with the President. In view of kis

concern,

Katzenbach stated that if he had approved such requests For

electronic surveillance he would have certainly have recalled doing

so and he had no such recollection.

Katzenbach stated it was not his policy to give

after-the-fact approval to electronic surveillance requests. (The

aforementioned memoranda were all requests for electronic surveil-

lance dated after the surveillance was. utilized.) Katzenbach in-

formed Mr. Iyler that he had reviewed his diary and on at least one

of the occasions when electronic surveillance was used, he was

avail-

able to approve prior to the use of the device and, therefore, there

would have been no need for after-the-fact ratification-of-the-l

electronic surveillance.

SENSTUDY 75

Katzenbach, according to Mr. Tyler, was shown the

Xeroxes of the alorementioned documents by the Senate Select

Committee during interview by that Committee apparently per-

taining to his authorization of electronic surveillance on

Martin Luther King.

It was pointed out by Mr. Adams that former Attorney

General Katzenbach in a memorandum dated 9/27/65 captioned

"Special Investigative Techniques" that he stated, in part,

concerning wiretaps and microphones "It is my understanding

that such devices will not be used without my authorization,

although in emergency circumstances. they may be used subject

to my later ratification:"

Mr. Tyler stated that Katzenbach had.not mentioned this

particular communication and that he, lyler, did not know that 'such

a communication existed.

Mr. Tyler stated that he and the Attorney

General had indicated to Katzenbach that in order to clear up this

question it would probably be necessary that he submit to interview

and that certain investigations be conducted. Mr. Tyler mentioned

particularly that handwriting examinations might be necessary to

verify the

authenticity of the initials affixed to the documents

in question. Mr. Tyler stated he would send the Bureau a memorandum

requesting a certain investigation to clarify this question.

Mr. Chairman, I wish to furnish the Subcommittee

additional details regarding our mail covers and surveys;

however, some of this information enters sensitive areas.

• involving national security, and I respectfully request it

be presented in executive session.

As I have indicated previously, the FBI's use

of maii covers and surveys as investigative techniques has been

based on fulfilling its lawfully mandated responsibilities.

The list of intelligence accomplishments resulting

from mail covers on foreign establishments alone is long,

but perhaps these examples will suffice:

In February, 1975, a member of the military holding

a "secret" clearance obtained while in training was determined

to be in contact with a foreign establishment.

Also last February,

an individual with a "secret"

clearance employed on a missile project was in such contact.

In November, 1974, a scientist involved in atomic

research was determined to be in such contact.

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 294

## Page 295

With reference to our former use of mail survey

operations in which we surveyed mail for indicators as to whether

further processing was warranted, permit me to further explain

the eight operations which I previously outlined in public

testimony:

Of these surveys, one was established in New York

as a result of the experience gained in the investigation

of a Soviet illegal. This illegal cooperated with the FBI;

and we learned that in directing mail to his Moscow center,

he addressed it in a specific fashion and also directed it

to mail drops in Europe.

From this experience, we were able to develop a

set of indicators which allowed us to select mail which we

felt was illegal agent mail. This, coupled with our knowledge

of known Soviet mail drops on this side of the Iron Curtain,

permitted effective screening of the mail and selection of

letters on a knowledgeable basis.

This method was proved successful when we uncovered

• three such illegals and successfully neutralized their

activities. This

survey was

conducted between 1959 and 1966.

A second survey was based on the use of these same

indicators in examining incoming mail directed to certain areas

of New York City and other cities in an effort to detect mail

being directed to illegal agents

• in the United States. This

survey was conducted between 1961 and 1962.

-2 -

NW 55256

DocId: 32989667

Page 295

---

## Page 296

• A third survey was based on our knowledge that

illegal agents in the United States directed communications

to Soviet-bloc intelligence officers employed at the United

Nations in New York City. Again, this survey was based on

solid information that this means of communication was

utilized by the hostile intelligence service. This survey

was conducted between 1963 and 1966.

A fourth survey was conducted in the Miami, Florida,

area. •It also utilized the known indicators and the known

mail drop addresses. on mail being sent from the United States

to Cuba. As an example, during the period of time this program

existed in Miami, from January 2, 1963, until July 21, 1966,

60 letters were determined to contain secret ink messages

either on the letter or on the envelope.

Fifth and sixth surveys were directed against mail being

sent to the United States from the People's Republic of China

and Hong Kong, as well as mail directed from the United States

tọ China. The coverage of mail from the People's Republic

of China and Hong Kong was initiated August 1, 1956, and was

discontinued on January 24, 1966. The coverage of mail directed

to China operated between 1964 and 1966.

A seventh survey involved mail being sent from Chinese

individuals residing in Canada to Chinese individuals residing

in the San Francisco, California, area. This survey operated

for two months in early 1961.

NW 55256

DocId: 32989667 Page 296

## Page 297

The purpose of these fifth, sixth and seventh surveys

was to acquire information concerning Americans living in China of

interest to the intelligence agencies of the United States; to detect

efforts by the People's Republic of China to persuade scientists

of Chinese descent in the United States to return to the

People's Republic of China; to detect efforts to arrange

travel by these

scientists and to learn any information they

would provide the People's Republic of China; to ascertain

identities of subscribers to and recipients of Chinese

propaganda publications; and to develop information concerning

persons of security interest in the United States who were

corresponding with persons in the People's Republic of China.

The eighth survey, conducted from 1940

to 1966,

was of mail addressed to Soviet-bloc and other embassies and

diplomatic missions of national security interest.

This program was initiated shortly before the

United States entered World War II and its vital necessity

during those perilous times seems obvious.

Following World War II, the eighth operation was

concentrated against the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc countries,

and much greater selectivity was used in screening letters

to be opened.

We were able, for example, in 1964 to detect

the fact a civilian employee of the United States Navy

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 297

- 4 -

---

## Page 298

offered to sell classified information to the Soviet Embassy

for $50,000.

With regard to the FBI's participation in the CIA

mail interception project, when we were offered data from

that operation, we initially set forth four specific areas

of data which could be of value to our national security

responsibility:

1. Correspondence of a suspicious nature which

might contain double talk;

2. Correspondence indicating Soviets might be

• using a hostage situation to develop sources in the United States.

3. Correspondence indicating a weakness or

dissatisfaction on the part of any Soviet in the United States.

4.

Information indicating Soviet control or direction

of the Communist Party, U.S.A.

In August, 1961, we advised the CIA that we were

interested in letters in which the United States addressee

or addressor was a Government employee, working in a

sensitive industry, or an American wishing to defect to

Russia.

In February, 1962, we established additional

guidelines regarding the type of letters for which we had

a requirement to help further our efforts to uncover illegals.

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 298

-5 -

---

## Page 299

Knowledgeable FBI officials reviewed this data

periodically, and surveys were conducted, to assure that we

were receiving only data pertinent to our legitimate

• responsibilities.

May I conclude by saying, Mr. Chairman, that the

FBI was motivated in these matters by a genuine desire to

faithfully discharge our national security responsibilities --

to detect and identify illegal foreign agents and persons

willing to serve them.

I. FBI USE OF MAIL COVERS

Legal basis for mail covers

The FBI utilizes mail covers as an investigative

technique in accordance with requirements set down by

law and the Postal Service.

Procedures for obtaining

mail covers are precisely set out in the Postal Manual,

Section 861.

The legality of mail covers has been substantiated

by a number of court decisions, beginning with Mr. Justice

Field's statement in Ex parte Jackson (1877); recognition

of this view through Oliver v. United States (1957); United

States v. Costello (1958); United States v. Schwartz (1960) :

Cohen V. United States (1967); Lustiger V. United States (1968) ;

United States V. Isaacs (1972); cert. denied 417 U.S. 976 (1974) .

History of Utilization by FBI of mail covers

The FBI has utilized mail covers allowed by the

U. S. Post Office Department and subsequently the Postal

Service as early as 1928. FBI procedures have been in

accordance with Post Office policies and procedures in

effect at a particular time.

From 1928 to 1945, Special Agents in Charge of

respective field offices were authorized to request a mail

cover from the appropriate Post Office official in their

.NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 301

---

## Page 302

• .

respective territories. In 1945, the FBI policy was changed

to allow the SACs this authority only in cases involving

deserters, fugitives and escaped Federal prisoners. All

other cases required FBI Headquarters approval. In 1947,

the FBI's policy was returned to the pre-1945 rule and

SACs were again permitted to request authority from the

Post Office without approval of FBI Headquarters. In 1954,

however, regulations were instituted whereby all mail covers

were to be limited to thirty days and justified to Headquarters

prior to being requested. This policy of final determination

by FBI Headquarters is in effect today.

Current statistics of mail covers utilization by FBI

As of September 26, 1975, current mail covers requested

or in place totaled 79. They were as follows: National

security - 61; Fugitive - 18; Criminal - 0.

The number of mail covers represents a minute

fraction of the total number of investigations pending on

a daily basis.

Authorization procedures consistent with Postal regulations

The FBI follows the procedures for obtaining mail

covers set out in the Postal Manual, Section 861.

Inasmuch

as the FBI fits the "law enforcement agency" definition in

the Manual, we make our requests to the Chief Postal Inspector

- 2 -

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 302

---

## Page 303

or the Regional Postal Inspectors in Charge, depending on

the type of mail cover requested.

No level of authorization in the requesting agency

is specified in the Postal Manual. However, as indicated

above, present FBI regulations require that mail cover

requests must be first cleared through FBI Headquarters

for approval.

FBI Headquarters screens the request to insure

that the mail cover can be potentially productive and that

the nature of the case is of sufficient import to justify

the technique. These decisions are made upon justification

from the field office, review by Headquarters' supervisory

personnel, with final decision resting at the Deputy Associate

Director level or above.

Benefits achieved by mail covers

Mail covers have proved to be valuable as an

investigative technique in certain investigations. For example,

mail covers have led to the identification of individuals

holding security clearances who contact hostile intelligence

services and who have provided intelligence information of

interest to the hostile foreign intelligence services.

Over the years mail covers have provided leads

which have resulted in the location of fugitives.

In

criminal cases, mail covers have provided information that

has led to the discovery of evidence of criminal violations.

:

Purpose of mail covers

Lawful mail covers as an investigative technique are

based on the premise that discovery of an individual's

contacts provides knowledge of the individual's actions,

as well as indicates other avenues by which knowledge of

the individual can be obtained.

Objectives, of course, vary depending on the

type of investigation involved. For example, in fügitive

cases, mail covers may be used in instances when the

fugitive's close associates or relatives are obviously

hostile or suspected of being so. When official contact

by law enforcement with these persons is rebuffed or

impractical, mail covers are often useful.

In selected situations where a crime has been

committed or an attempt made to do so, mail covers can

be used to identify participants or co-conspirators and

provide leads in investigations.

In national security matters, the insight provided

by mail covers is invaluable. The FBI's successful fulfillment

of its national security role rests largely in determining

the activities of hostile intelligence services.

The mails

are obviously a means of communication which allows a

foreign intelligence service accessibility to persons or

places from which they would otherwise be prohibited by

- 4 -

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667 Page 304

## Page 305

law or where their physical presence would be suspect and

thereby negate a covert effort on their part. Knowledge of

their mail contacts can open avenues of lawful investigation

which can be most productive.

II. FBI PARTICIPATION IN CIA MAIL INTERCEPTS

The FBI first learned of the CIA mail intercept

project.from a CIA official in January, 1958. The official

confidentially advised our liaison Agent that CIA had an

operation in New York in which mail going to, and coming

from, Russia was being examined by CIA.

We were advised the project had been furnishing

valuable economic and political information in Russia as

well as the identities of sources and potential defectors

in Russia.

The CIA operation presented excellent potential

for uncovering

Soviet espionage operations in this country.

On January 24, 1958, our liaison Agent was told by

CIA representatives that the CIA had initiated negotiations

with the Post Office in 1952, and finally had worked out

arrangements for this project, with the approval of Postmaster

General Arthur E. Summerfield.

Our understanding was that under that arrangement

CIA would be permitted to initiate mail cover on mail going

to and from Russia.

- 5 -

NW 55256 DocId: 32989667

Page 305

---

## Page 306

The CIA coverage first involved merely photographing

the envelopes, and later resulted in the opening of mail.

CIA told us it had acquired considerable data of

foreign intelligence value. CIA also indicated a willingness

to handle leads for the FBI regarding matters within our

national security responsibilities.

It was recommended, and approved by Director Hoover,

that we ask CIA to advise us of any product of their operation

that would be valuable to us in discharging our national

security responsibilities. Once the receipt of material

began it was

reviewed by knowledgeable Bureau officials to

assure the information was pertinent to our responsibilities

and justified our continuing to receive such information.

Our interest was in detecting foreign espionage

agents an individuals in a position to do harm to our

national security and indicating willingness to do so.

In December, 1962, we were advised by CIA that it

was handling mail between the United States and Cuba. We were

asked if we had any requirements for the product of that

operation. We responded with a request for data -- which we

carefully delineated - that would be of assistance to us in

fulfilling our mandated national security responsibilities.

In March, 1963, the CIA discontinued coverage of

mail going to Cuba.

## Page 307

In February, 1973, the FBI was approached regarding

taking over the CIA mail intercept project. We did not, and

in May, 1973, we received the last data from this CIA operation.

In summary, our relationship with this CIA project

extended from 1958 to May, 1973. We have no figures for the

number of items we received during the initial stages of that

operation; however, beginning in August, 1964, we began

preparing summaries of items received.

The full-year count ranged from a low of 1,353 in

1972 to a high of 6,256 items in 1967.

III. FBI USE OF MAIL SURVEYS

The FBI has conducted eight mail survey operations

solely in the discharge of its national security responsibilities.

None has been conducted since 1966.

These surveys were instituted because of their

potential value in discharging the FBI's responsibilities

in the national security field.

These surveys were conducted to detect and identify

foreign agents who threaten this Nation's security and to

detect other persons who indicated willingness, and were

in a position, to sell out this country to hostile foreign

powers. Each survey program was carefully circumscribed

as to its scope and was conducted for specific objectives

with strict administrative controls.

DocId: 32989667

## Page 308

These surveys involved the processing, or opening,

of mail; but they did not involve wholesale, indiscriminate

opening of mail. In these surveys we were looking for

indicators as to whether review of the correspondence might

lead to the detection of an illegal foreign agent or a

person cooperating with a hostile foreign power. Although

considerable volumes of envelopes were surveyed, the vast

majority of this mail was not further processed because it

did not contain indicators which would make it relevant to

the survey•

This informative memorandum records contacts with

former FBI employee by person claiming to be with Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence (SSC).

On 10/3/75, IWalian Gregari, took a telephone

call from one Loyd R. Reedy who advised he was calling from

California. He claimed he had been telephonically contacted

by someone claiming to be on the SSC who desired to interview

Reedy.

Reedy did not get the caller's name and did not

determine what the caller wanted to interview him about.

Nothing definite was arranged between Reedy and the caller.

MDR-16

Our records contain an out-of-service personnel

file concerning Loyd R. Reedy, who entered on duty as a

Photographic Aide in the Identification Division 4/20/70,

GS-3, and who resigned 7/17/70. This individual is from

California and, when he resigned, he gave a forwarding

address in Salida, California.

There is nothing in the

file which would in any way suggest an interest by the SSC

in this individual. Of particular note is the very brief

nate neces

service he had in the Bureau and the position he was in.

After clearing with Supervisor P. V. Daly of the

Legal Counsel Division, W. O. Cregar and S.

F. Phillips of

the Senstudy 75 Project orally discussed with Mr. John I.

Elliff of the SSC Staff the matter of Reedy's call to the

Bureau. He did not have any knowledge of why anyone from

the SSC would call Reedy and he said he would check into

the matter to see it anyone from the SSC has had an intere

in Reedy. Elliff was briefed on Reedy's very short tenure

of service and what he had done in the Bureau.

It was

indicated to Elliff that if Reedy was not contacted by a

representative of the SSC, it is possible someone is so

impersonating himself.

During the week of 10/6/75, Reedy telephoned in

again from California and spoke to Daly who told him that if

he is again contacted by anyone representing the SSC, Reedy

should determine the person's name and nature of the

interview desired. Thereafter, Reedy should call the Legal

Counsel Division collect. We have heard nothing further

from Reedy.

Daly has also advised that Elliff has told him

that, after checking at the SSC, Elliff was unable to determine

any interest in Reedy. Elliff did not indicate the extent

to which he looked into this matter.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is extremely unlikely that the SSC would have

any interest in Reedy who had only three months service in

the position indicated in 1970. If an SSC representative

did, in fact, contact Reedy, it may be they have the wrong

person. There is no action we need to take at this time as

Reedy is on notice that if contacted again, he should obtain

specifics and then call the Legal Counsel Division.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. For information.

This note is classified "Secret" in order to protect

the confidenti lity of our relationship with the French

Security Service, infra, the disclosure of which could

reasonably be expected to result in serious dam-ge to

national security. The subject of above SSC inquiry, Joseph

Kraft, is the well-known newspeper columnist. A review

of the kroit file reveals that the Irench Security Service,

the DST, condtcted a microphone surveillince on Kraft's hotel

room for approximetely one week during a 1909 visit by Kraft

to Peris.(SSuch coverage was effected through the urging oi

W. C. Sullivan, former issistant to the Director, who travelod

to France at such time apparently at the direction of deceased

I'BI Director J. Edger Hoover. Deteils of the above coverage

have apporred in the medic apparently as ^ result of leaks

This Agont will be reaponsible

Agoni working this type of case should participate in the

formulation of counterintelligence operations.

GOALS

For maxinun effectiveness of the Counterintelligence

Program, and to prevent vasted effort, long-range goals are

being set.

1. Frevent the coslition of militant black

nationalist groups.

In unity there is strengch; a truisn

that is no less valid for ail its triteness.

An effective

coalition of black nationalisi groups night be the first

step toward a real "gau lau' in America, the boginning oi

a truetblack revolution.

2.

Prevent the sine of a "nessiah" who could

unify, and electrify, the nittant lace nationaliat novement.

Halcolm & night have been such a "nessiah;" he is the martyr

of the movement today.

Martin Luther King, Stobely Carmichael

and Eltjah Muhamned all aspire to this position Elijah

Muhanned is less of a threat because of his age.

King could

be a very real contender for

• this

position should ke abandon

his supposed "obedience" to "white, liberal doctrines"

(nonviolence) and embrace black nationalism.

Carnichael

has the necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way.

3. Prevent violence on the part of black

nationalist groups.

This is of primary importance, and is,

of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it should

also be a

goal of the Counterintelligence Program. Through

counterintelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential

troublemakers and neuralize then before they exercise their

potential lor violence.

" Provent nilitant black nationalist groups and

leaders from gaining respectability, by discrediting then

to three separate segments of the community.

The goal of

discrediting black nationalistsmust be handled tactically

in three ways.

You nust discredit these groups and

individuals to, tirst,

the responsible Negro community.

second, they must be ciscredited to the white community.

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGESICE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST-ITIE GROUPS

The

effectiveness of counterintelligence depends

on the quality and quantity of positive infornation

available rogarding the target and on the imagination and

initiative of Agents working the program.

The response of

the field to the Counterintelligence Progran against the

Communist Party, USA, indicates that a superb job can be

done by the field on counterintelligence.

Counterintelligence operations must be approved

by the Bureau.

Because of the nature of this program each

operation must be designed to protect the Bureau's interest

so that there is no possibility of embarrassment to the

Bureau.

Beyond this the Bureau will give every possible

consideration to your proposals.

Our counterintelligence efforts will be designed to

prove Communist influence and expose the Communist connections

of those associated with KING.

It is reasonable to assume that if

SPOCK and KING do become candidates they will take steps to make

this more difficult, because it is a most damaging charge.

An indication of what may happen can be seen in a report by one

New York Informant who said there was an uncoordinated effort

to keep SWP and CP members out of the spring Mobilization by

not telling them of the time and place of some preliminary

organizational meetings.

However,

the Communists were not

about to be kept out, and they did, of course, participate in

the spring Mobilization.

If Freedom House maintains its opposition to KING,

this may be our best channel for accomplishing our counter-

Intelligence objectives. JOHN MORSELL of the NAAD iS truStee

of Freedon Housent therpast we have furnished him information

under the counterintelligence program about CP members in the

NAACP. Possibly something similar could be done concerning the

The Freccom Flouse position

paper said that Dr.

King had

"emerged as the public

spear-

carrier of a

civil disobedience

program that is demagogic and

irresponsible in its attacks on

our Government."

The segro leader's reasons

*for atlomoting to divert the

it indicated that as

"the racial

revolution had slowed," and the

"black power militants" faced

oldcr

such as the N.4.4.C.P, and the

Urban League resumed "genu-

"King's

The

led by Di. King in New York

on April 15 "had all the car-

the position paper said.

"The majority of the march-

ers may have been motivated

tinued.

"It would be absurd to de-

This is hard on those who

are embittered

by the war,

but we should tell them in no

uncertain terms that the hope

of democracy is that its dis-

senters voluntarily and under

no legal penalties draw the

line well before

the danger

point.

The cynical exploitation of

developments in

the war in

should be deplored.

Burning and otherwise des.

a despicable act.

Those

The mood of intolerance,

among

onstrated in the recent denial

to Gov. George Wallace of his

right to speak at Darmouth

College and the equally repre-

hensible reception accorded to

The Communist Party's backing of a peace ticket

featuring MARTIN LUTHER KING &nd BENJAMIN SPOCK during the

1968 Presidential election without & doubt offers a

counterintelligence potential of & possible magnitude which

we previously have not had opportunity to explore.

However,

as observed by both New York and Chicago in re communications

this potential cannot as yet be accurately evaluated.

As noted in re communications, we do not yet

know nether KING will change his mind regarding presidential

candidacy.

He recently disclained any interest in politics

and it is possible he may remain steadfast in this position

despite the efforts of spock, the Commnist Party, and others

to enlist him in a political

race. At this moment, it does

not apuear that we would have much opportunity for effective

action unless KING changes his mina.

Atlanta agrees with Chicago's observation as to the

poLitical Situation of the Viet Nam conflict. Again, it will s

be necessary for us to bide our time until we are able to

resolve

this

facet or at least feel confident in estimating

the significance thereol.

It is felt thai New York's suggestion that Freedom

House might present a practical channel for our objective

is very practical.

a sense opened the door in this regard

publicized paper and since ve appear to have an existing

ReBulet 5/18/67 and Nylet to Bureau 5/25/67.

It is agreed

that the CommunistParty's (CP)

interest in a peace ticket headed by MARTIN LUTHER KING and

BENJAMIN SPOCK offers the appearance of a counterintelligence

opportunity.

The reference to this matter in Bureau letter

dated 5/18/67 obviously relates to the Presidential elections

of November, 1968.

As a practical matter it is nearly certain that a

KING-SPOCK ticket

would have no chance to record more than a

minute fraction of support from the electorate.

The political

Situation between now and Navember, 1968, could change

drastically, with Viet Nam being the point of chief concern

for all candidates.

Aw 55256

Certainly the present administration will do every

thing possible to bring about a resolution of the conflict in

Southeast Asia.

The dangers attendant to the administration's

present policies

are both military and political. From the

military standpoint, the ever present possibility of direct

Chinese intervention is quite evident.

The political realities are such that President

JOHNSON, if he is unsuccessful in bringing about negotiations,

would have to go to the electorate and ask for another term

while three quarters-of

a million American fighting men are

engagod in a terribly difficult war half a world away. It is

an envious position for any Presidential candidate, even

Thus, at this time it is not easy to believe that the

present situation will remain steady through November, 1968.

As a consequence, our exploitation at this time or even in the

near future of the communist backing of a KING-SPOCK ticket

offers a questionable vehicle to move against the Party.

Certainly they cannot be attacked because they favor a

peaceful

settlement of the Viet Nam war.

Even the President's more responsible opponents on

Viet Nam have taken to careful delineations of their stand.

The 16 so-called Senate "doves" in May of this year issued a

• statement clarifying

their position.

They made quite clear that

while they. believed in negotiations

they did not advocate

withdrawal. of U.S.. forces nor were they expressing a lack of

confidence in the morality of the U.S. position.

This Senate

group included Senators FULBRIGHT, KENNEDY, HARTKE and CHURCH.

Attacking anyone,

even communists, because

they favor

peace would seem a dubious tactic. Should we soon commence

nationwide exposure of the KING-SPOCK-communist alliance, we

might be chagrined to see, in the period between now and

summer of 1968, developments resulting in a truce or other

cessation of hostilities in Viet Nam.

Then we would have only

been instrumental in publicizing the

efforts of a small segment

which coincided with the efforts of the Johnson administration.

The communists and their accomplices do not deserve such

belp.

If a counterintelligence program is in order in this

field, it should be prepared but held until the spring or

early summer of 196S. By then the Johnson administration will

have undoubtedly done everything in its power to resolve the

conflict. If successful, the glory will accrue to the present

administration. If their efforts have failed, then the CP and

their KING-SPOCK tandem will be whooping-up the peace theme.

At that time exposure of the relationship would be most

pertinent.

It would also doubtlessly be appreciated by the

administration Effectively tabbing as communists or as

communist-backed the more hysterical opponents of the President

On

the Viet Nam question in the midst of the Presidential

campaign would be a real boon to Mr. JOHNSON.

The specific means of exposing the KING-SPOCK-CP.

• relationship would require very careful consideration.

ReBulet mentioned the circulation of material such as flyers,

-2-

NW 55256 DOOId: 32989667

• Page 409

---

## Page 410

CG 100-32861

leaflets, cards and bumper stickers.

We would not rule out

these devices.

We would suggest that our use of such tactics,

if ever made known or even hinted at, could be the source of

the most severe sort of embarrassment for the Bureau. It

could be asked,

with telling cogency, "What does the FBI

have to do with the selection of presidential candidates?"

The only possible answer could be "Nothing."

Should it be decided that a counterintelligence

move be started on this question in the spring of summer of

1968, we suggest the use of & political columnist or reporter

tor this purpose.

A reporter or columnist of national stature,

properly briefed, could write an excellent account of

KING-SPOCK ticket. It is the sort of article or series

expected of a first rate reporter with first rate sources.

It is suggested that the Bureau consider our

comments as reflected above.

Consider also a top columnist

or reporter who might be interested in the KING-SPOCK story.

It is emphasized that this person should be respected for his

balance and

fair-mindedness.

An article or series by an

established conservative would not adequately serve our

purposes.

In this area the Bureau might desire to consider

a columnist such as CHARLES BARTLETT.

A former confidant

of President KENNEDY, he has excellent sources throughout

the government and is not too close to the present administra-

tion to be branded

as a propagandist. His relationship with

Senator KENNEDY and the Senate "dove" group also would negate

the charge that he is attempting to discredit these men.

Left standing would be the realization that BARTLETT had

good sources and came up with a top story in the midst of the

Presidential campaign. And BARTLETT, as a professional

journalist, would not be about to divulge the identity of

his sources. Thus the Bureau would stand harmless.

It is not known whether the Bureau has information

which would make BARTLETT's selection undesirable. If his

•selection is not feasible, there are others in the newspaper

field who could serve as well.

But it is clear that this

man should write on a national level and should not be a

protagonist for either those of the "hawk" or "dove"

persuasion.

Since the contact with BARTLETT would be made in

Washington, no specific recommendation is being made at this

time.

HUNTER PIITS/O DELL

Resorting to its typical methods of infiltration

into any organization to carry out its primary objectives

of building up controversy and widespread unrest, Communist

of consultant to the fieid stars of Reverend Martin Luther

King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In an

article reporting the news conference in Birmingham,

aLabama,

"The New York Times"

staff of workers in at least six southern states engaged

in helping community organizations to establish registration Lii

schools, work shops and

public meetings.

O'Dell, who has been known as Hunter Pitts O'Dell

since his birth in 1923

at Detroit, Michigan, attended

Xavier University in Louisiana.

He sailed as a seaman

the Merchant Marine Service until he was expelled from the

National maritime Union in 1y50 at Galveston, Texas, for

circulating pro-Soviet peace petitions attacking the United

State's Government.

During hearings before the Senate Internal Security

Subcommittee on the scope of Soviet activity in the United

•States in 1956, O'Dell took refuge in the Fifth Amendment to

answer questions relating to his activities as a Communist

Party organizer for the New orleans and Gulf Coast area.

Hundreds of documents seized by the New Orleans Police

Department at O'Dell's residence, 2319 Louisiana Avenue,

in March, 1956, when they were attempting to find him to

serve him with a subpoena to testify berore the Senate

subcommittee, clearly established his key position in the

communist movement in the South.

On 7/30/58 at Atlanta,

Georgia, O'Dell again

invoked the First' and Fifth Amenaments of the Constitution

when answering questions about his communist activities

upon his appearance as a witness before the House Committee

on Un-American Activities.

Since the publicity in 1956 surrounding his

in the synopsis of the report have been excised. This

excision occurred at the time the report tas originally

handled in 1962.

FBI records do not disclose the precise

reason for the excision. Inasnuch as the details of the

roport do not reveal a sinilar excision, it is our

conjecture at this tine that the excision was nade because

the statenent which was excised was not supported by the

details of the report and thus, in accordance with FBI

roporting rulos, the statenont vas prohibited fron inclusion

in the synopsis.

Memorandum from W. C. Sullivan to A. H. Belmont 12/24/63

summarized the results of a conference held at the Seat of Government

12/23/63 between Bureau officials and Supervisors and field repre

sentatives designed to explore how best to carry on our investigation

of captioned matter to produce the desired results without embarrass-

ment to the Bureau.

We completely analyzed avenues of approach aimed

at neutralizing Martin luther King, Jr., as an efiective Negro leaderfet

the avenues explored was that concerning any facets of the

financial operations of king and the organizations through which he i

operates which investigation might reveal either violations of the

law or other potentials for discrediting King or otherwise neutralizing

his effectiveness.

Bufiles contain two items of particular significance.

Washington Capital News Service release dated 10/22/63 reveals that

King's integration organization had an income of more than $735,000

during the past fiscal year and spent only about half of it. It is

stated that in a report of the financial status of the Southern Chris-

tian Leadership Conference (SCLC), of which King is President, King

I disclosed that the organization had a balance of $351,992.20 left

8/31/63 at the end of the fiscal year from a total income

ot $735,534.040

Another such news release dated 11/4/63 revealed that Representative

George Andrews (D-Ala.) asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to

investigate the tax status of the SCLC. Andrews is quoted as saying,

"Thousands and thousands of dollars are collected and spent each year

by so-called civil rights organizations and many people are beginning

to suspect they could be a front for a full-grown racket."

ED

FIL

It is noted that King's operations revolve principally around,

the SCLC. However, fund-raising operations on his part are further augổ

mented by the activities of the Gandhi Society for Human Rights, which

commenced operations in 1962.

100-3-116

OBSERVATIONS:

It is believed that an examination of recent income tax

returns of King might well reveal information which could assist the

Bureau in its efforts to discredit King or neutralize his effective-

This is possibly applicable also if the income tax returns of

the SCLC and the Gandhi Society were reviewed. In view of the possi-

bility that the SCLC has already been under some investigation by IRS,

a request for the results of such investigation is indicated. We also

had information in late 1963 that the Gandhi Society was negotiating

with IRS relative to tax exemptions and therefore the results of any

IRs investigation of that society would be worth procuring.

To date we have been most discreet and circumspect in our

handling of the King investigation, as well as corollary investiga-

tions such as revolving around organizations, because of the position

King has not only as a clergyman, but also as a "r'espected" Negro

Leader.

It is therefore essential that our current requests of the

IRS which are herein being recommended be handled in a manner which

would provide for optimum security so that neither King nor any other

unauthorized individuals may become aware of the Bureau's interest

and so that no embarrassment may come to the Bureau. For this reason,

the attached memoranda are classified "Secret."

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the Liaison Section obtain two

uncertified copies of each of the income tax returns available for

the past five years pertaining to King, the SCLC and the Gandhi

Society.

Attached hereto are three memoranda for the use of the

Liaison

Section.

My memorandun to you 1/8/64 recommended, and it was approved,

that the Liaison Section obtain income tax return

and investigative

data available from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pertaining to

Martin Luther King, Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC) which he heads and the Gandhi Society for Human Rights with which

he is also affiliated.

It was intended that a review of available data

be made for investigative and/or counterintelligence use in connection

with captioned matter.

Liaison Agent P. D. Putnam has obtained the following informal

tion through A. R. Manzi of IRS.

Concerning the Gandhi Society, records of the Manhattan

District of IRS failed to reveal an income tax return.

It is noted,

however, that on 3/20/63, the organization made an application for an

exempt organization status.

The application was denied. Reason for

denial is not known but believed to be that it was because the organiza-

tion had then not been in existence for 12 months.

On 10/15/63 the

organization reapplied

for exempt status which application is currently

pending in the Audit Division of the Manhattan District.

Attached for filing in the Bureau's file on the SCLC

(100-438794) is information made available by Manzi concerning the

SCLC.

Another similar attachment will be placed in captioned file per

& separate memorandum. The attachment contains the following informa-

tion of pertinence,

In the past there was some IS inquiry concerning SCLC's taz

obligations but at the present time it appears that this organization is

tax exempt and not under any investigation.

The IRS report of its prior

inquiry notes the purpose of the organization, when it was founded and

other miscellaneous data.

The attachment also contains correspondence

King was

deficient. for.the.years 1957, 1958 and 1959 for a total

of $1,556.02 which represented deficient taxes plus penalties. IRS

considered the application of a fraud penalty but found such to be

inappropriate as it was not able to establish the fraudulent intent

of the taxpayer. The IRS inquiry developed that in July, 1960, the

Shipp, on an anonynous basis, lead material which he may develop

As an example, Atlanta notes that

Comment:

We have already obtained

all available information fron

that IRS has no action pending

did advise, however, that King's current income tax returns will be

scrutinized very carefully for

pay possible violations.

(3) Atlanta notes that

a check with King's bank in Atlanta

not desirable as security could not be guaranteed.

It notes,

however, that King has a personal account in a New York City bank,

name unknown. We have been separately advised by New Yoris that the

SCLC had an account at the Manuracturers Hanover Trust Company,

New York City, but the account was closed on 1-16-64

Comment:

By separate communication, we will have the few York otice

determine whether or not

any other bank in New fork city carries an

account in King's name. This check will be conducted only under

discreet and secure circumstances, and ve intend to make such checks

of the account, if located, as might uncover information helpful in

our investigation.

King has been using as a "hide-away" at Atlanta an

apartment of his associate, Ized Bennett. An anonymous source check

at this apartment is not reasible. It is noted that the apartment

is frequently used for King's extramarital escapades. Atlanta has

considered possible sensitive-type coverage but notes that king anc

Bennett have indicated an interest in obtaining another apartment in

another area.

Comment:

We will

have Atlanta follow this matter closely so that if

another apartment is taken, consideration can be given to full coverage.

If the apartment remains the same, we will have atlanta consider

possible sensitive-type coverage.

Some other items considered by Atlanta but which do not
