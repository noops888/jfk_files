On September 18, 1962, Confidential Informant IP T-2
advised SA HAMILTON that since FRANK NICK Z1ZZ0, FBI #1538814,
has been indicted by the Federal Grand Jury in Hammond,
GAUTTADAURO is now in charge of all Lake County, Indiana Ling
activities.

On November 20, 1962, Confidential Informant IP T-3
advised SA JAMES E, DOYLE that ’ ANTHONY GRUTTADAURO is in charge
of all football-basketball parlay cards distributed throughout
the Hammond-Gary area. IP T-3 advised that GEORGE CVITKOVICH,
also known as GEORGE CORY, a present East Chicago, Indiana City
Councilman, formeriy handled football~basketball parlay cards for
GRUTTADAURO in East Chicago, Indiana, but this assignment had been
taken from him when he became City Councilman. IP T-3 stated
that CASIMIR ZAWADA, also known as CASEY, a runner for these par-
lay*cards, wanted CVITEOVICH'’s job, but did not get it, in favor
of EDMUND MILOZEWSKI, Hammond, Indiana, a relative of. CVITKOVICH.

IP T-3 has previously advised that about three years ago
a dispute arose over one week's parlay cards involving winners _
making it necessary for IP T+-3 to contact the man in charge of
these parlay cards. He stated that shortly thereafter, FRANK NICK
ZIZZO, whom IP T-3 advised is in charge of all bookmaking in the —
Calumet area, appeared at IP T-3's place of business, and intro- .
duced thé informant to ANTHONY GRUTTADAURO, whom he advised was
in charge of the parlay cards in this area.
