are missing is not determinable, it is felt that all could
be simply the result of mis-serializing. This theory is
supported indirectly by the fact that some numbers have
been used more than once within this same file without

_ having been discovered until .this review of the file.

The “enclosed serials have been separated according
to the respective volumes from which they came, and arranged
chronologically. '

. Serials 495 and 496 are copies of California
Identification Records for HARVEY EDWARD LOHMEYER and THERAL
BURNS, LYMAN respectively. These serials are actually enclosures

" to Serial 497, an aixtel to Memphis, ‘however, they have :
been xeroxed and enclosed to maintain continuity in ghronology.

DACB; ‘this matter is considered Ruc.

Assistartt Attorney General
Crinfinal Division
Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: This scale model, presently in custody of the Visual
Presentation Unit, Special Projects Section, consists of two
parts, a large seale model of the flop house from where Ray
fired the shot and a smaller model of thé entire block of
the crime scene. Both parts were used extensively during the
trial of Ray. Although introduced as evidence in the trial,
the District Attorney, Shelby County, Memphis, Tennessee, left
disposition of the model to the Bureau in 1969.

Section Chief R. L. Strain, Special Projects Section,
advised that final authority for use of the model by the HSCA
would rest with the Department of Justice. This authority was
provided verbally by Mr. Keuch on 6/6/77, to SA Aldhizer of
the Congressional Inquiry Unit. Personnel of the Special Projects
Unit prefer to deliver, set. up and retrieve the scale model in
order to provide careful handling. Original blueprints. from which
the modél was constructed are retained in Bureau files.

Since there are no legal problems in loaning the model
and Department authority has been obtained, HSCA cooperation
in this situation is warbantéd. The HSCA has advised’ Mr. Keuch.
that the modél will be useful. in interviewing its witnesses. In
his letter, Mr. Stokes said the model would be returned upon
request of the Department or after its use by the HSCA, whichever
comes first. HSCA staff offices are located in the old
Identification Division building.

This matter has been. coordinated with SA Strain,
Laboratory Division and SA P. Vs Daly, LegaI Counsel Division.
Mr. Keuch has advised no letterhead memorandum to the HSCA is
necessary since he is coordinating delivery of the scale model.

Assistant Attorney General
erininal Division
Attention: Mr. Robort L. Keuch

September 18, Officer Blair (or Bair) (phonetic), riding home
with me while his car was broke down made the offer to me said
he belonged to an organization that wanted Martin Luther Ming
killed. Zhe price he mentioned was $500,000 to anyone killing
this mah. I refused the offer and tonight I will attempt to
£ind out who made this offer. I will see if Officer Baix (or
Blaix) wants a ride home tonight while his car is broken down.
This is Officer Clifton Baird. ‘he next voice you will hear
will be that of Arlie Blair (phonetic) and myself."

A conversation then takes placd on this tape reportedly
botwoen Baird and Arlic. After sone idle chatter, Baird and
Arlie, in essence, say the following regarding King: Baird
says, "@alking ebout Martin Luther King the other night, who
is it you know who wants him knocked off?" Arlice replies,
"Somebody? . , . "a lot of them that want hin knocked off."
Baird agrecs and says there are only two organizations that
would have that much money, the "Communist Party and the
Ku Klux Klan." Arlie says “. . . he (King). can be had."
Baird agrees and says “. . , when you do, you have to start
a civil war, probably.” Baird says “. « .-I don’t know, fT
just don't want no part in it, do you? I sure don't.” Arlie
says "the only way I would oporate is if the money was right ~
Natit r aintt even involved, not new and I don't intend to

aia e ah

It is noted that part of the examination by our
Wechnical Services Division suggests that the “introduction”
(on this tape reportedly made by Daird as sect forth above) ‘may
have been inserted ovor the existing recording but a more
definitive conclusion on this point cannot be reached without
developing and examining tha magnetic patterns on the HECA tape.

there is no further refererce to Martin Luther King
on this tapa, (other than the information on Pages 2-5 of the
enclosed remorandum summarized above) and no mention is made
of the FBI. You wore previously advised in my April 5, 1977,
momorandum that the only reference in the files of the FBI to
tir. Baird is that he was the subject of a civil rights brutality
complaint in 1963. The only xeferenca to an Arlie Blair (or Bair)
in the files of FBI Headquarters and our Louisville Office is that
an Arlie Blair, an officer of the Louisville volice department was
the subject of a civil rights brutality complaint in 1957, Inouf-
ficient identifying data exists te know whether or not the Arlie
Blair rcportedly mentioned on this tapa is identical with the
Arlie Blair who was the subject of this 1957 civil rights complaint.

Assassinations on 4/29/77:

Side 1 of Tape
(Dotted lines denote words that are unintelligible.)

Baird - Today is September 20, 1965, on September 18,
Officer Blair (or Bair) (phonetic), riding home with me while
his car was broke down made the offer to me said he belonged
to an organization that wanted Martin Luther King killed. ‘The
price he mentioned was $500,000 to anyone killing this man. I
refused the offer and tonight I will attempt to find out who
made this offer. I will see if Officer Bair (or Blair) wants
a ride home tonight while his car is broken down. This is
Officer Clifton Baird. The next voice you will hear will be
that of Arlie Blair (phonetic) and myself.

Arlie - Well anyway me and him is gonna have to
have a little conversation---and I believe we can do it.

Baird - Down in the Carolina's?
Arlie - That's right.

Baird - When are you gonna get to see him? What
did he do to you?---

Arlie - The guy ain't done nothing to me yet. I
just want to whip his ass. Don't like his looks. Think I
ought to take him up and kick him around.

Baird - Who is he?”

Arlie - My nephew.

“Baird - Your nephew? That's the one who's gonna
drive the truck with you, is it?

Arlie - I don't know if I did?

Baird - With him? You're talking about your nephew,
shit, you've been talking about us for three years.

Arlie - He's the only Obscene obscene) I have met that's

aman, not because he's my nephew. . . he's the only son-of-
a-bitch I have met that is come out of the hills faster by God
than since the last well .. . since I have been big enough to
know what.a,man is.--- Just like on a rain pole when that old
goddamn mule was marred. You remember that shit real well.

I don't know what those Obscene obscene) gonna do. I know
theth son-of-a-bitches is dogs. That's right. I talked to
them; not to Bill but to Wood.--~

~2-



, ig :
Baird - Do you know what universal is?---

‘Arlie - When you can run 'em like that’, go down and
_ have all that has money.

Baird - Well, they didn't know a damn thing about
trucks when they started. Rafold (phonetic). was suppose to
have been a truck driver before he had come to the police
department. But, I think all he ever drove was farm trucks
and that sort of stuff. But I don't think Rafold (phonetic)
ever drove the real commercial trucks, I don't think he knew
anything about them,

Arlie — I wouldn't doubt it. . -

Baird - They just took his opinion, that's all it
was.--~- They worked about six months and that outfit took
them for everything they could get out of them and when they
went broke, why they picked it up.

Arlie - That's another thing, if you are gonna

hold out, you gotta take more out than you need. You know
that?

Baird - Oh yeah.

Arlie - That's right. Yes sir. See when you work
‘ them lathes (phonetic), there is no proverb if best of all.
Every time I talk about it, I get a kick out of that. You
know someone told us about that black whiskey. You know
what I mean?.

Baird ~ . . . running them trucks, you gotta know
something about it, you know, you can't just go into it blind.

Arlie - It's the easy thing you got Cliff. You
pee gotta have the guts .

Baird - Arlie, not to change the subject. You know
we were talking about Martin Luther King the other night. Who
a in the @bscene) is it you know who wants the son-of-a-bitch knocked
: off?

4 : ’

Arlie — Huh?

Baird - Talking about Martin Luther King the other
+ night, who is it you know who wants him knocked off?

Arlie - Somebody.
‘Baird - Well, Arlie, here's the thing about it.

Arlie - A lot of them that want him knocked off.

Baird - Oh yeah, there is a lot of people, yeah, I ~
agree with you. : :
Arlie - ------
Baird - But here is the thing about it, there is i
only two organizations that would have that much money it
would be the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan and he
couldn't trust anyone of them.
Arlie - No.

Baird - So I am going to tell you. The best thing 1
you can do is to forget them.

* (Noise of banging)
Baird - Backfires.
Arlie - I understand.

Baird - Because that son-of-a-bitch I am telling
you Martin Luther King is a big son-of-a-bitch.

Arlie - Oh, he can be had.
Baird ~ He can be had, ya, that's right but when

you do; here's the thing about it Arlie, when you do, you
have to start a civil war, probably.

Arlie - Right now that's about the best thing we
can have ... . a civil war. 7

‘ Baird - But here's the thing about it, its probably
coming it anyway. I agree with you, it's probably coming. But
that would start it I imagine.

|

Arlie - You know a funny thing Cliff.

Baird - But I tell you Arlie, I don't know, I just
don't want no part in it, do you? I sure don't.

Arlie - The only way I would operate is if the
money was right-which I ain't even involved, not now and I
don't intend to be. The only way I would be involved if I
went looking for it, and if I went looking for it, of course
I went looking for it I would know uh---~a number.

Baird - Well, I tell you Arlie, that Martin Luther
King is big and it will probably start a civil war. I don't
know who it is that made this offer to you, but boy I teil
you, just forget it, because it is shit, it might start
something that 10 million people get killed . . . women,
kids, children, old ladies, old men, everybody else. But

the bastards like you and I, it don't amount to much .
I mean you know we're superficial, I mean we can be replaced; ’
we will be replaced so will everybody . . . I mean everybody
will be replaced sometime or another.

Arlie ~ The thing about it is I ain't gonna beatae
about it. At one time + «+ let me you know-~-.

Baird ~ No, I'm not either Arlie.

Arlie - I don't know what them is.

Baird - You know all I want.

Arlie - No, I know what you're thinking about Cliff. i
And I think he misimproved me the other day on the. My good
blood brother down south. With what I said, if I can kill you
without question the good----oh anyone else would like to know.
Without being caught.

Baird - Well here is the thing about it.

Arlie - I could.

Baird ~ Arlie, Arlie, the only people that wanted
Martin Luther King knocked off is two people.

Arlie = Right.

Baird - I mean with one half million dollars is the

“Communist Party which they would do it just to start a’ bunch

of crap, you know, and Ku Klux Klan . . . they would do it
just out of revenge. Ah--you know, to get even or to keep
the colored people down. But I am gonna tell you Arlie, I
don't exactly sympathize with colored people. I think most
of them could do better if they tried. 90% of them could do
better but you know down south in Alabama and Mississippi,
colored people are accustomed to----. They are not allowed
to walk on the damn street or anything else. They have no
voice in the Government and you know here is why Hitler didn't
like the colored people. They took all the shit and they
didn't have backbone to fight back. That was his sole reason
for hating colored people. a

Arlie - That's the thing I think we ought to get
together now on. I even had the chance now we can make a
deep voice. That is why not we don't want those colored
folks down in South Carolina.

‘ Baird - That's it. That's right. Why don't they
move up north. That's it, I would, wouldn't you?

Arlie - No-~-



“Baird - No, I tell you, this world can't stay much
longer like it is with the shit they got now. This world,
it's not for long. You know the Bible's right, it's gonna

- end in fire alright.

Arlie - You know the funny thing I like is that a
lot of people think I'm nuts but uh I wonder why?----
Pity man that walks out on. this earth. He can make a rock
about 7 or 8 million pounds of rock. I am not going nowhere
with it. A big object. Yeh, big h-bomb trying to destroy.
I don't want it here in my living room. But, I don't believe
man himself want to destroy this world. I don't really know
Cliff. oe

Baird - I do Arlie, I believe man is destroying :
himself. ‘ : i

Arlie - I don't think so because I will tell you
why. Is there a little meat in this place? He tells me
where to go. ----and someone said no one knows how we would -
look, the angels had said this. No, no one else wants to
take your place. Man himself would not destroy this earth.

: You can foryet about that. Man has not enough sense. Man
i . has made the h-bomb. They can destroy about anything. I
1 would tell you what I believe. I don‘t think man himself will
blow this damn world up. I don't believe he can do it.

Baird - I don't know. . .

Arlie - If man himself wants to destroy the world,
the angels in heaven would ignore him. Wonder that man would
want to destroy himself. The Democratics come up with some
goddamn sharp place for a change.

Baird - Yes, that's it.
| : : Arlie - huh?

Baird - That's it:

Arlie - If their choice is---and the whole darn
thing, you're right. He's gonna help-~-he's gonna help.

Arlie - No he ain't. I bet you a hundred and one he

Baird - At least part of them.

Arlie ~ Maybe I ought to know, I ought to care myself,
if you want me to. :

Baird - Well Arlie I don't know. I don't have the facts
to back me up. But I'd say it's really - I don't have the facts
to back me up but I would say no use calling all the plays now
that's my opinion.

Arlie - He's, no it's ---~ I know what you're thinking
about. He is calling the gas ghetto. Namely not a book and ah,
what can I say ---~---- ,» two or three other guys have received
aetetetatenetaaetered he's the main powerman. Sure don't believe he'd

do a thing like that. I'm the old authority. I know what's
going on, he can't fool me a bit, cause I know what's going on.
The idea is he's trying to get a common observer, we're ail
working on the same pay, to get a common -------. It all
depends on how we're going to handle this thing that's the idea.
Do you know what I mean?

Baird - Yeah.

Arlie - Alright let's suppose that: I'm the boy back here
Good point there. We got something here to discuss. Everybody

. sets ------ hollering. I said wait just a minute. Let's just

quiet down and quit fooling around. We'll take every man's opinion.
Now we'll work out something everybody is on the same team see,

But the idea you have to do Cliff you have to have a leader of
that group. I don't let any choice ~-~--~— what's wrong with that?

‘ Baird - Well Ed Shoring (phonetic) is he's the one pulling

‘the thing together.

Arlie - Do you blame him for that?

the main guy that runs this county and everything else.”

Baird - Yeah, he runs Marlo.

Arlie - Marlo is Jefferson County peewee ‘i

hell of a pinch, I don't know. :

Arlie - What?

Baird - With the pinball machines.

Arlie - (Laughs) He just got me a --

Baird ~ Oh shit, they is guilty Arlie.
Arlie ~ Hun?

Baird - They is guilty. . 4

Arlie - Who?

Baird - Shit, they left that meeting in the Holiday Inn
with all those pinball records and Ned Beckett (phonetic) knows it,
and if they didn't go to Jefferson County they'd work on their ass
and don't think they wouldn't. And old Ed Shoring (phonetic) saved
their ass boy.

Arlie - No --~-------~----- af

Baird - If they ever got them out of Jefferson County
they would have, they would have torn them up. You could believe
they would -have. :

thing they holler well man better go on
country free. Next thing they say well I think ‘the women ought
to have their man's job and then it would be equal.

Baird - Yeah.

Arlie - Well.now if they want to have equalization of
the amount of taxes, I'm for it. When they become 18 years old
they po in and register for the draft.’ You draft the women in

the service and you don't have no type of ------ of sexes in the
barracks or nothing. Each one of them go on in just like a man.
And another thing is. aa

Baird ~ Zip off and go to the showers. and everything.
Just like that.. I'm for that Arlie. I think that's a good deal.
I think that's, that's the best idea anybody has ever come up with
yet. I love that.

Arlie - Well what the hell, goddamn ain't there equalization.
If it's going to be equal goddamn, itts gotta be equal all the way
right?

Baird. - That's right.

Olie - And if you want to lay out in the mud when it's
40 below, ride -- that low Ml ride along with them.

Baird - You know what I'd like to say, what I'd like to
see, last month was what's that lieutenant in the Second District
at the Ratler (phonetic) , what's his name, Buckmore (phonetic).
He said the policeman's job was more dangerous than the combat
infantry. Now what does he know about the price of peaches in Russia.
Now I'm going to tell you because he's never been there. And I've
heard some good stories about him. I don't know. And it comes
pretty straight and ah, but ah, what does he know about the prices of
peaches in Russia? But I'm going to tell you one damn thing I just
spent 10 years in the police department and then one day on Awol.
I'm going to tell you this, because they shot our ass off, and I
don't know whether there's any, that police department down there
couldn't be much worse and easier than Trojan (phonetic) -----------
was cause we'd liked to have froze our ass off up there. It was
35 below up in the tops of them damn mountains and I'm going to tell
you I don't know what that man knows what he's talking or not but
I'd like to see that big fat son-of-a-bitch glide in, have to dig
in, and where are we going to sleep tonight, where's our beds said
the men. Why don't you dig, in over there in that big stove pile you
big fat son-of-a-bitch.

‘Arlie - That's your poeenneee- i

NW 55045 -. Doeld: 32989745 Page 71

‘Baird - And then until the groups move back or come
forward or something. Old Bucky wrote that article a policeman's
job is more dangerous than a combat infantry. What does that
son--of~a-bitch know? Boy I'm going to tell you, he don't know
much if he wrote that stupid article like that. I'm going to teli
you he don't. Man I'm going, to tell you when those damn motor
shells start knocking dirt in your ears and them damn 50 calibers
start cracking over your head, they crack like a damn firecracker.
Man and I'm going to tell you he just don't know what in the hell
he's talking about. I'm going to tell you he don't. You could
stay scared not for 30 minutes, not for 10 hours, but you could
stay scared for weeks. You stay scared for three, four, five weeks.
While you're on that damn mine. You're scared every damn minute.
Now what the hell does that son-of-a-bitch know, he's never been
anywhere, he's never seen anything, he's never done anything and
what the hell does he know. He's nothing but a big fat gob of shit.
I've heard some good stories about him and I tell you who this
eee is nobody but his daddy. His daddy was a doctor and I
tell you get Lieutenant Kohl (phonetic) to tell you about him
sometime. He can tell you all about him.

Olie - I don't know, I never did care nothing for Kohl
either. Like Kohl, I don't care about none of them @bscene)
down there. 2

Baird - Well I'm going to tell you Kohl is alright.
He's different. He don't give a damn about nobody but Kohl. But
when he tells you something he can usually speak your damn ass
off, he's usually true. Kohl won't bother you unless you bother
him. And that's just the way he feels and when you work for Kohl
you don't call me and I won't call you. You' take care of your
work and I'll take care of mine, and to me Arlie you can't work for
a better son-of-a-bitch than that. Cause I figure that I can
take care of anything that happens out here, I don't need no help.
I'm usually soft and I do the best I can. If I can't do the best
I can well piss on it, it's all gone, but I kind of admire old
Kohl, but if you want to know about Buckmore (phonetic) ask
Lieutenant Kohl, he'll tell you about him. I ain't even going to
spread the rumor, but ah, it's all rumor.

Arlie ~ -----
everyone of us has got

Baird - Wait, you know not changing the subject, but you
remember one time I asked you, was that two local policemen who
broke my door down out there, that screen door? Did you ever hear?

Arlie - Ah, oh yah, I don't know what you're talking
about Cliff, I never did get in on that oné. TI just heard and
that was all. I could probably have got the answer, I don't know,
but I ---------- and it was --~-~--~---~-- that killed it and that
was it.

Baird ~ ----- Bene an po ee ne ee nnn .



' ‘

Arlie - No, hell no it wasn't ---------~. No, what tthe
hell do you think I am.

Baird ~ But I got to win this. I can't solve this, two
police break my door down or kick it in. -

Arlie - Who the Kell they were Tooking for.

Baird - Well, I don't rightly know. But the slat was
broken. : :

Arlie -
want to goddamn

kick my @bscene) door in anytime you
- solve it. . e.

Baird - I know Arlie, but Arlie here's-the thing about
it, I'll be there to tell you the next day, if I-kicked you're
door down, I'd‘come and tell you about it. I wouldn't wait for
somebody down the street come by and tell me ah, say, I think it's
two policemen, one in a white shirt and one in a blue shirt.

- Arlie - You ever talk to them?

Arlie - - ~ was it. Goddamn, I mean you just
won't talk about it what the hell was that.

Baird - Well, I tell you it was a long story, but.

: Arlie - Goddamn I can't help you if you ain't going to
help me, shit. I mean I ain't asking you to help me I mean I

said something I shouldn't, what the hell was he going in there for.
Seteatatetad oh shit, forget about it goddamn it just like I said I want
out of this damn city of Louisville - I want out of the police
department , I want out of the whole @bscene) -- I don't
want no son-of-a-bitch ever to come up to me and say - .

I will get the @bscene) in his teeth.

Baird - I don't ‘blame you Arlie, I would too.

Aplie - And I've got three little kids in there. I'd

take a million dollars a piece for and I don't want no son-of-a-bitch

Arlie - ---~---- with everybody else and most men have

that they treat everybody like they're gentlemen. And every man

I ignore everything I can and I back off. But when some start 7
@oscene) on me there's going to be blood and it ain't going to be
blood blood because that son-of~a-bitch will want to kill you.

Baird - He's allergic to his own blood ain't he. Arlie
here's the thing about it, do you remember you made the statement

“to me that one of them couldn't help it, do you remember that.

Arlie - -------------~ I remember you talking about
that and I know one night that you were well perturbed and you
were well mad, and I don't blame you at all, and it was, talking
about who it might have been then and all that; but you never
would say who, and I might have said some words that I meant
because I don't recall it, ever mentioning it. I might have.

Baird - Did you make the he abdadaahd that one of them
couldn't help it?

Arlie - No, I don't remember making a statement like
that, because if I made a statement like that I'd admit of
making that statement, --- - only one guy ~ —, that would've
been me and I wouldn't do it.

Baird - Yeah.

Arlie - And you know goddamned good and well that I
wouldn't.

you might have been hot, pressing and all that but that old

Baird - Arlie there's no reason to do that, none
whatsoever, stay and fight these son-of-a-bitchés till hell freezes
over, cause you don't have anything to worry about and nothing else.

Arlie - (Laughs)-- I know I don't- have nothing to worry
about. But goddamn -----~--- .

Baird - Cause the job is going to get better in the
very near future, it's going to get damn sight better and you
better believe it. Like I told you Arlie one time you was the
best friend I got whether you realize or not, you're still ‘the
best friend I got down there in that damn police department.
Well there's a couple more that probably equal you but.

Arlie -— They don't mean much.

Baird - Ah, you are the best friend I got. You
probably don't realize it right now but you are. So, ah, you stick
with it and ah, you'll make alright -~----~--------- .

Baird - Yeah, once in a while on a Sterling (phonetic)
they'll] pull off and I guess you're able to do that anyway.

Arlie - Oh yeah.

Baird ~ The Sterling is the only one.like it. Now you
know between Sterling and Melish High iad I can't tell any
difference.

Arlie - There ain't a hell of a lot of difference.

Baird - It tastes just exactly alike to me.

Arlie - I_can tell a little bit, there is a little
aifference but, ah, I'm going to tell ya too. You know what the
difference is?

Arlie - I imagine | that if the truth was known they use
the same formula. .

Baird ~ But it tastes just exactly alike. Oh, Blue
Ribbon, to me, tastes sweet.

Arlie - Yeah.

Baird = Does it taste sweet to you?) I mean women like
that. In my opinion, véer to me, to be good, has got to have a bite
to it, you know.

Arlie - Taste of the hops.
Baird - Yeah.

Arlie - You know what's funny, when you're a kid growing
up you like stuff sweet. The minute you get older you don't like
stuff sweet you want something bitter. ‘You get up to a certain
age you start liking pepsis or cokes. Which are, cokes reminds a-
little on the sweét side. Pepsi's got a little more of a tang to
it. But then you get to the point you don't like them. Now then
you want something that's got kind of a, more of a bitter taste.

Baird ~Yeah, like, ah, when I was 21, 22 years old I
had to have a drink and I'd mix it with coke or ginger ale or
seven up or something, you know something sweet. And now I want
my yellowstone in water.

Arlie - Yeah.

Baird - I don't want anything sweet. And when I was
a kid I used to drink coffee all the time. I drank coffee ever
since I was knee high to a duck and I use to put about four, five
teaspoons full of the damn sugar in it.

3 Arlie - I didn't put sugar in my coffee.

| Baird - But now I want just enough sugar in that coffee
{ to knock that bitter taste, just maybe, bearly, well between a

half and three quarters of a teaspoon full of sugar. Just a
little bit not much.

Arlie ~ ---+---- a lot of ~------ but I always liked

eoffee black, but, ah, my wife ----~-- usually drink one cup of
coffee every morning for breakfast that's all, and actually
we don't drink nothing else -~------ . But I tell you used to

be up there at home working! up there long, 10-12 hour days,
usually 12, you got tired, hot and five, five-thirty we used to
breakfast , set for five-thirty.:* We started work about six-thirty,
seven o'clock when we were suppose to be startinre. The first
thing you smell, when you woke up, was that hot, strong coffee
boiling. That aroma would be running’all through that doggone
shanty.

Baird - You know if I was building me another house, you
remember houses like you use to build way back in the country
with oak boards. You'd run them damn things straight up and down,
you know vertical, and then put a slab right over the crack?

Arlie ~ Yeah.

Baird - I'd like to have one of them damn things with
‘an over hanging, maybe about two and a half feet, and a great big
rocking chair. ---- tight -------- you know that son-of-a-bitch
would be pretty you know. see

Arlie - Yeah.

Baird - But it would cost you a fortune to get that
wind of lumber now you know it.

Arlie - Sure would. I was talking to a guy up there at
» he's still got a saw mill and a planer, in fact he's got a
roof, but, ah, the only, the saw mill man I know up
there has got one because, I mean in town I mean there are lumber
companies now.

hon

Baird - Yeah, they've all got them there.

Arlie - Ah, but this guy I come around there, I was
wanting to buy some, he built him a little house, of course this
guy made a cabin, heck of nice then, he had a boy that died back
while I was in the high school, heart trouble. My closest friend.
They were brothers, two brothers actually, they were so much older
than me and weren't around he wanted to put him in some nice oak
floor and he wanted to know for how much it-would cost him for

what he'd need. And figured out I don't know the ----- or how

big a house he had but ---~---------- about 52 or 53. He came over
and said, well I can get $250 a thousand for the floor. He told

us he don't want pay ----~--- for this. It was just tire, what you

call tire sap, we used to call it, an inch and a quarter lumber
that we'd ‘knock off the side of the log in getting down to a
square for a tire. Why rather than cut it all off for a slab,
why I'd just take off - -the slab, the Iog was big enough

pies Ly Beit



to make the tire but there'd be enough on the side, actually,

that you'd be wasting. Then we'd cut off another board there and,
ah, but, -- -- the thing is you've got two saws like that and
you set them back and forth and you can run your board through
there and it knocks off the two strips on the side. And that
tire, at that time ran about $50 a thousand-and now I imagine it
runs about $80. That's just rough lumber and that's ----- but

if you've got a doggone ---------~-- you'll take that damn stuff
and make yourself some nice doggone, anything you want. He told
those guys he don't want to-.pay no $250. So I tell you what I'll
do ~ no way, he'd take ------ logs and he had
tetates —- truck and he said if you bring the logs around to

my mill. Ee said I'll cut it up for you and run it through. Tell
you what. You want $20 a thousand for sawing it he said ~-~~----
pay for $15. So ~-~-.-------=--- $35 a thousand, of course, a man
brings his own lumber in the ‘will. We figure well ----------
right. there I'd figure it would take 140 X 300, get me about right
close to 500 pieces of lumber for the house. So you figure that
for a man of like up there most people no money anyhow, but $250
-that's $125 which the old man just wouldn't had anyway.

‘Baird - Yeah.-

Arlie - But he was able to bring it around there and for
about, well it would cost around $18, $20. It's hard to believe
that doggone tongue groove flooring. Do you know what, tongue
groove, I doh't know what costs around here but I know what it
costs around at home. Tongue groove oak flooring cost you now.

Baird - No, I don't, ‘but it's expensive I know that.
Arlie

Last job I had is $350 a thousand.

Baird

$350 a thousand.
* Arlie - 35¢ a foot.

Baird - That's a lot of money. You know Arlie when I
was a boy ‘we bought rough oak lumber $4 or $5 a hundred. I don't
know just exactly what it was.

Arlie - Well -~----~ I know back to about that Thursday
night at Bowie I can remember it selling what for, tire sap, rough
lumber so, we commonly call it tire sap. It was $30 a thousand.
That was number one grade. :

Baird - Yeah, ---------- $3 a hundred. You buy something
like that now it didn't cost you a fortune. Where are you going to
get it? You know Arlie here a while back I was doing some work
around the house, and, ah, well it's been several years ago, but TI
hit some fur two by fours, then I sawed one off and I set (possibly

dishes clanging, Baird says no not yet), one up in the corner of

the house there. Then I went back a couple of weeks later, oh

about a month later I guess, and picked the damn thing up. You

know that damn thing on the end, a foot up from the ground, it
rotted completely’ and all that was left there was just a few little
splinters of those hard rings and that was all that was left of

that end. Now you know when I was a boy we used to see those old
two by fours and you could take one out and throw it ott in the
barnyard and that damn thing would lay there for years and it would
eurl up and get hard as as a damn piece of steel but it’ wouldn't rot
It would lay there and get just as black and just as hard as a, it's
poets en nee ne and all that stuff, it just ah.

.Arlie - -------- which I wanted to'‘see if this brother-
’ in-law of mine, I told him EF thought he was full of shit, but he's
all true force. Up in East Tennessee, I don't’ know, something is
supposed to be around 70 or 80 miles out-of Kingsport. There is
supposed to be a boundary of white oak timber. Four or five
different outfits had went in there and bought, had tried to work
it, couldn't do it, between the rock cliffs and rattlesnakes he
couldn't get it.. Yell I've never seen any @bscene) place yet that
I couldn't get that damn shit out of there. Suppose to be first
a@ group of .white oak timber. 7

‘

{

Baird - How many acres is it?.

“ Arlie - From what he says there is suppose to be somewhere
in the neighborhood of around 500 acres. That would be a hell
of a lot.

Baird - -~----~ if you could get you some fencing and
fence the damn, put a fence around that and then get you some of
the old razorback hogs and turn them’ damn things loose and they'11
take care of your damn snakes.

oe santas ee eS

Arlie - No, they say they won't.

Baird ~ They won't?

Arlie ~ They said not hogs. Now he said this my brother-~
in-law said they was rougher in this area, in this place where we
» took timber out of over near,

Baird ~- Well I mean water falls off the cliff you can two
or three more of you could take his place but a hog would eat a
snake and anything it can get. Did you know that? And it don't
make any difference a rattlesnake, copperhead, anything, water-

_ Moccasin, they'll eat any kind of a snake they can get.

-19 ~

55095 ~“~Declar32989745 Page 78



Arlie - But they had a place over there along side old
West Virginia. I tell you if you can cut a damn tree down, maybe
halfway up the mountains sometimes closer to the top but when you
go to chop the son-of-a-biteh ------ dovn in the gourds, should do
it. You cut that‘ son-o. -~bitch down he's gone, I mean gone and

you have to watch ----: ~--- because if there's anything for him
to hit to split open, you don't want him to do that. He usually
toss with -------~------+ notch of one side and tosses around

the side of the hill at a certain angle and let it go. And I've
seen them things cut them off and they go down them hills hollering.
I mean it was that damn steep by hell where you had to hang on

with both hands. And let me tell you I was able to practically
walk up that damn house out there at that time, and he says it's -
rougher than that.

Baird - Well I was riding a bus through East Tennessee
one time and, ah, past this cornfield one time and I looked out and
I swear that thing was on a slope just like that and you could
stand down in the lower row and get the corn off a row below you.

frlie - Oh, yeah, I done that. (Laughs) But I just wanted
to say, well the funny thing trees are, of course, if there is an
opening on the ground, once the tree gets started it'll run the
roots a long time, the wrong way to get water in there and food
source in order to get big. But them white oaks, of course, if
they don't watch the stem what happens your lumber man, oh, shit,
just a minute, a long time ago they up and the law passed in fact,

I think it's on the books that only -~----- they could use the
stays of one half. ---------~ they have to use more timber now
eause it. --------- . And that's what caused it. But fora

white oak you couldn't make stays out of that shit if you wanted
to. That's the crookedest damn bunch of shit I ever seen. You
ean take a white oak, -=------ white’oak and use ---------~- at

the base -~-~------- and then it'll run straight, it will look

real straight, nice ------~--- « I don't know how it looks on

4 making stables, I've never made it on stables out side of grove
ae timber. None of them guys even tried. They said you're wasting

‘ - your time and I wouldn't doubt it. But you can saw that shit up
and you can put it in a nice shady spot where sun can hit it. See
sun will draw the boards like it will make them curl and you can
put weights on it and ee else and that damn shit will curl
up, twist up, snarl up. :

Baird - Yeah.

“Arlie - You can make a two by four or‘two by six or
anything else you want to out of white oak, satin rope, boy I'll
tell you what you can do if you don't want it in the yard where
the sun will hit, that's freshly cut today, and I'll bet you by
the day after tomorrow that thing will be bent at least three
foot.

Baird ~- Yeah.

Arlie - I don't want that to do that.

Baird - Well here's the thing about it Arlie, it's not as
old as the other. That's the trouble. See you take little trees
set out there 150 years in the wind, and the rain, and the storms,
and the lightening and everything. They get tough you know, and,
ah, you take something that grows in 20 years, a tree that grows
in 20 years. and it'll get big but it's not as tough as that other.

Arlie - No, white oak might be at least 50 years old.

Baird - At least yeah.

Arlie - Cause the good thing on the white oak I'd say
is not over I'd say shit 50 years but it would be a lot more ~
than that, -------- real fast ----~~---- board.

Baird - They grow real slow, real big, real strong.

‘Arlie - Yeah, you take a pine or a poplar that grows
real fast and a len (phonetic) grows lot faster than. a poplar..

‘Baird - A what?

Arlie - A len (phonetic).

Baird - What's that?
Arlie - It's a, actually it looks like a poplar, a form

of a poplar family I guess. It's real soft. We call them len
(phonetic) trees and the tree is a little different than a

poplar. Most of their ---~----- wood is darker. Most poplars got a
yellow color to them, but they've got a, orange or kind of a bloody
like color to it.’ Actually ---~-~--~--~-- one guy up there bought a

bunch of those and sawed one down and I told him, it might make real
Mr. Blair. He was damned suprised alright.

‘ -~ stacked up out there. About three weeks before he
went and hauled it off -~----------~--- . He said that stuff is
already fallen apart. You can just take your finger and pinch it
through. Dad said well I told you. But you could take that len,
(phonetic) you could take a board, say about two by four, two by
six and cut you one about foot and a half, two foot long and you
could took one of them with your bare hand and broke it in half.

Baird - You know we're talking about Eastern Kentucky. -
What they ought to do is plant trees all over the eastern part
of the state. You know take place of those coal’ mines.

Arlie - -

Baird - You know what they do? They're suppose to
reseed this stuff and have been for years. They'll take a damn
airplane and they'll fly over those, what are they, ah, excavated

t rascals, are about this high. What happened, I went around and

that's too close. What you do you set them out and you let them

say their kids been sick too. The doctor says there's a virus

them damn son-of-a-bitches don't know what the hell it is causing it.

They've got bacteria pretty well whipped. Virus might be two

a half a dozen different diseases you know. Well Mr. Blair I guess

up it's momentum it can go on faster.

Baird - Those hell cats are very maneuverable. I imagine
top speed is only about 350.

Arlie - ------- 400. I don't think it was on the first
one but about 300: .Fact is I believe it's 300 or listed at 320,
that's about absolutely top. But that's the different type engine
you got there.

Baird - Yeah, probably got a more powerful engine now.

Arlie - But still it's maneuvability to be able to
slow down, to slow down about 90. Well hell 90 miles an hour.

.Baird - I remember during the Korean War Dukes brought out
this damn biplane at a top speed of probably 120 miles per hour.

Arlie - At the most.

Baird - And hell we had those saber jets and see them damn.
biplane machine gun troops with that little biplane and those damn
saber jets all of them didn't fire under 500 miles an hour forward.

Arlie - They'd fire under 300.

Baird - It was tilted faster,. they slide a little biplane
q up to about 300 miles an hour.

Arlie - ---~----- watch the cockpit and they come in
on you like that and you turn around like that and say well -------
Caleta you turn around and you switch, you start to head off like
a diagonally and.as quick as he starts moving closer starts getting
in gun range of you they -~- ~-- out and he's right back the
opposite way. Well when you get back the opposite way you're
going say 60 or 70 miles an hour and he's doing about 200
miles an hour why hell. Where's he at, oh,-he's going yonder.

Baird - He's gone up.

Arlie - That's what it is. Yeah, and that was something
else. I'd just as soon forget about it.

Baird - You have a rough night last night?

right by that son-of-a-bitch near that goddamned gate before he
stops. I told him about that shit before. I said you're going
to get us hurt one of these times like that and shit. And Davis
and Stuart drove by and here came this loud mouth son-of-a-

rifle to this guy. Well the guy didn't offer no resistance or
nothing. Young guy I'd say somewhere in about 25's. We found
out he was a county policeman which we didn't know that at the
time. 5

Baird - Yeah, I heard something about that. I didn't
know what .happened.

Arlie - Well, here's how this son-of-a-bitch up there was
going to whoop this guys ass. They were shuffling back, stood back
by my desk and I grabbed’ the @bscene) by the shirt collar and then

But this punk, 53 years old, he's trying to come out and tell me
that his 15 year old boy, which is bigger than I am, he don't know
who started shooting his ass. Now if one of my-boys comes in and

thing I'm going to do is to slap them back end cuarter or someplace

The following is an examination of this tape by
the Technical Services Division of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation:

Because the HSCA tape was provided for only a
brief period of time, only limited examination of the tape
could be conducted. The following sets forth results of
examination of the HSCA tape and technical analysis of the
copy of the tape produced at FBI Headquarters: :

Physical inspection of the HSCA tape revealed it
to be standard 1/4-inch wide magnetic tape on a standard
5-inch diameter clear plastic reel. Into the plastic of the
reel was scratched “BFB 1 4-5-77."" The tape had the appearance
of standard 1/2 mil (1 mil = .001 inch) thickness. A measured
playback time of approximately 59.5 minutes at 3 3/4 inches per
second supports the assumption that the tape is standard 1/2
mil’ thick. The tape backing was polyester plastic and no
unusual visual characteristics or coloration of the oxide
were noted.

In summary, the reel of tape furnished appeared to
be commonly available standard tape and of a length within
the expected tolerances of tape manufacturers. This type
of tape would have been available in 1965.

Development of the magnetic patterns on the
beginning of the HSCA tape revealed that it was recorded
in a 1/2-track configuration, that is, the recorded infor-
mation covers 1/2 the width of the tape. This is a
standard tape recording configuration. For the purposes of
convention, the recording of the pertinent conversation will
be referred to as "side 1." There is present on the tape a
second "side" (designated as "side 2") which is a second

- 27 - :

track of recorded information. This information is recorded *
backwards relative to side 1, indicating the recorder used
was probably 1/2 track monaural. This again is a standard
recorder configuration and recorders of this type would have
been common in or around 1965.

As indicated previously, the’ playback time of the
tape at standard 3 3/4 inches per second speed was measured
to be approximately 59.5 minutes. The recorded information
‘on side 1 and 2 is, however, of substantially shorter duration.
The recordings have the effect of continuously slowing down
causing the voices to drop in pitch and requiring constant
upward speed adjustment of the playback recorder to normalize
the speech. The observed effect is however opposite to that
which normally occurs when batteries grow weak on battery-
operated recorders. There might be other explanations for
this effect based upon mechanical considerations of the recorder
transport mechanism but exact cause cannot be determined with-
out specific knowledge of the type of recorder used. Speed-
correction of the recording revealed that the side 1 recording
was approximately 34 minutes duration. The conversation on
side 1 ran off the end of the tape. The side 2 recording was
measured at approximately 34 1/2 minutes duration and the
conversation terminated prior to the end of the tape.

The following additional information is provided
concerning specific items of interest:

1) Nothing unusual about the physical characteristics
of the HSCA tape to indicate the age of the recording was
observed. Some oxide was missing from the very end of the
tape which usually indicates the tape has been used to a con-
siderable extent. It is entirely possible that the tape could
have been used to record a conversation in 1965.

oe 2) There is no clear indication of whether the HSCA
tape was an original or a copy. This kind of determination
is dependent upon availability of the recorder used to make
the recording as well as further detailed study of the HSCA
tape. :

3) The acoustic characteristics of the recording
(reverberation, enhanced low frequency components to the
voices, extraneous noises) indicate the recording could have
been made in an automobile or other vehicle. -If a remote
microphone was used, it would not-be necessary that the
recorder itself be in the passenger compartment. At approxi-
mately 21 minutes 23 seconds into side 1, the recording

‘ indicates Blair to be returning to the vehicle. The sound

- 28 -

Id:32989745 Page 87



§5045 Doold:32989745 Page 88

of the vehicle door slamming shut behind him is audible.
Little,other vehicular traffic is evident on side l. At
5 minutes 4 seconds a passing vehicle is audible, at 5
minutes 55 seconds a sound similar to squealing tires is
present and at 6 minutes 35 seconds a seriés of distant
explosions is audible to which Baird comments "Backfires."

The side 2 recording was made in an environment
similar to side 1. On side 2 considerable more extraneous
noise jis evident. At 1 minute 3 seconds, 2 minutes 48 seconds
and at} 5 minutes 13 seconds traffic is heard to pass. At

25. minutes 36 seconds and again at 28 minutes, 44 seconds

jet aircraft are audible and quite pronounced, indicating

the véhicle is parked relatively close to an airport. It
should be kept in mind, however, that sides 1 and 2 are

independent recordings and could have been made at substantially
diftefent times. There is, further, no technical indication of
which’ side, side 1 or side 2, was recorded first.

4) It is very ‘likely that the "introduction" did
not occur in sequence with the remainder of the side 1
recording. For approximately 8 seconds prior to the "introduction"
the necorder was activated. Although no voice is audible
there are audible tones present on the recording. Frequency
measurement of these tones indicate the tape was running slower
than;normal speed and was continuously decreasing in speed
(dis¢ussed previously).

Beginning 8 seconds into the recording and con- vf
tinuling for another 50 seconds (the segment: which includes
the"fintroduction") the tones suddenly shift upward in
frequency and the recording occurs at normal speed. Immediately
following the "introduction", 58. seconds into the recording,
the jtones shift downward in frequency discontinuously to a
point comparable to the first 8 seconds of the recording.

The j""introduction" begins with an apparent recorder start
transient, a recorder stop transient is evident at the end

of the introduction, but no similar start transient is apparent.
The above suggests that the "introduction" may have been inserted
ovef the existing recording but a more definitive conclusion on
this point cannot be reached without developing and examining

the magnetic patterns on the HSCA tape.

5-G) The recorder appears to have been activated
manually. Bumping and handling of the microphone is audible
prior to recorder turnoff during the conversations. This
suggests that the remote switch which activates the recorder
may be incorporated in the microphone housing. During the

- 29 -



conversation on side 1, the’recorder was stopped and started
on £~wo occasions, at 14 minutes 40 seconds and again at 21
minites 10 seconds. These stops do not occur during the
pertinent conversations.

1

: 7) Indications are that the tape was. manually

turned over to obtain recordings on both sides. No auto-
reverse markings or sensor tape was observed on the HSCA

tape and there is no time relationship between the respective
recordings on side 1 and 2 to indicate auto-reverse had occurred.

Memorandum W. D. Campbell to Mr. Cochran
RE: MURKIN

DETAILS:

: On 4/29/77 Mr. James Chenowich, HSCA furnished a
reel of magnetic tape for reproduction by the FBI. A direct
copy of this tape was made the same day in the presence of
Mr. Chenowich and SA John C. Lawn. Leader tape was attached
to both ends of the HSCA recording to ensure reproduction of
the entire tape. Upon completion of the reproduction, the
leader tape was removed and the tape was returned to Mr.
Chenowich in its original condition.

Because the HSCA tape was provided for only a
brief period of time, only limited examination of the tape
could be conducted. The following sets forth results of
examination of the HSCA tape and technical analysis of the
copy of the tape produced at FBIHQ:

Physical inspection of the HSCA tape revealed it
to be standard 1/4-inch wide magnetic tape on a.standard 5-inch
diameter clear plastic reel. Into the plastic of the -reel
was scratched "BFB 1 4-5-77."" The tape had-the
appearance of standard 1/2 mil (1 mil = .001 inch) thickness.
A measured playback time of approximately 59.5 minutes at
3 3/4 inches per second supports the assumption ‘that the
tape is standard 1/2 mil thick. The tape backing was polyester
plastic and no unusual visual characteristics or coloration
of the oxide were noted.

In summary, the reel of tape furnished appeared to
be commonly available standard tape and of a length within

standard tape recording configuration. For the purposes
of convention, the recording of the pertinent conversation
will be referred to as "side 1." There is present on the
tape a second "side" (designated as "side 2") which is a
second track of recorded information. This information is
recorded backwards relative to side 1, indicating the
recorder used was probably 1/2 track monaural. This again
is a standard recorder configuration and recorders of this
type would have been common in or around 1965.

PURPOSE: --To-advise- of receipt of information from a Keith oH
Ernest Lamonica, a News Director of a Seattle radio,

station, to the effect that a Raoul Santiago Estejo Martinez /

is the unidentified "Raoul" referred to by James Earl Ray.

Ray has claimed that “Raoul" was an international gun-runner and

he drove "Raoul" away from the crime scene wholly unaware of

the killing of King. 6 2-1/7 290-25 73

SYNOPSIS: This case pertains to the assassination of Martin
Luther King on 4/4/68 in Memphis, Tennessee.

James Earl Ray pled guilty to this murder and presently is

in local confinement. On 6/1/77, Keith Ernest Lamonica, a News

Director of a Seattle radio station, advised SAC, Seattle,

that he now has developed information indicating that "Raoul"

is actually Raoul Santiago Estejo Martinez and that with the

cooperation of Ray's attorney, Lamonica is to meet with Martinez

through an intermediary, Cliff Andrews. Lamonica indicated

when this information breaks, it will cause considerable

publicity; he has already been contacted by 3 major net-

works and leaves Thursday morning to be interviewed by the

"National Enquirer" in Florida. He has been interviewed by

the louse Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA); however,

he did not have the aforémentioned information on "Raoul"

during this interview by the HSCA. Martinez reportedly

indicated he will testify if granted immunity. Lamonica's

purpose in’ contacting FBI was to, express concern for the

safety of his two daughters inasmuch as he heard indirectly

that a New Orleans “hit man" would cause him or his family alot

of trouble if the story breaks. SAC advised Lamonica of the -

HSCA of his fears.

Memorandum to Mr. Fehl
RE: MURKIN

Our prior investigation never identified the
existence of a "Raoul." A Task Force of the Office of
Professional Responsibility, U. S. Department of Justice;
recently reviewed our investigation of King and in examining
the allegations re "Raoul," it concluded that ."the task
force views the exculpatory content of these varying and
patently self-serving tales to be unbelievable," and "we
concluded Ray was lying about the existence of a 'Raoul'."

Lamonica refers to intermediary, CLiff Andrews,
and although insufficient identifying data exists, there
was one C. H. Andrews who in 1974, indicated to Ray's attorney
that he had information concerning a conspiracy; however, a
District Attorney General in Memphis and another attorney felt
this was a hoax and upon interview, Andrews denied any knowledge
concerning the King slaying.

RECOMMENDATION: By memorandum dated 4/28/77, we advised the

Department that in order. to avoid duplication
of investigative effort and the attendant problems between, the
FBI and the HSCA that could arise in the future, and until the
jurisdiction of this Bureau in these investigations (both the
King and Kennedy cases) is delineated by the Department, the
FBI will refer all allegations relating to these investigations
to the Department for its consideration as to whether any
investigation is required of the FBI, or whether the Department
desires to furnish these allegations directly to the HSCA.
Accordingly, the Department will ‘be advised of the information
furnished by Lamonica and no investigation will be instituted
unless specifically requested ‘by the Department.

Memorandum to Mr. Fehl
RE: MURKIN

6:45 P.M., PDST, June 1, 1977, SAC Seattle received call
from individual identifying himself as Keith Ernest Lamonica.
Lamonica advised he is News Director with KYYX Radio, 1305 -
3rd Avenue, Seattle, Washington, Tel. 682-2828. Lamonica
identical with Bufile. 46-53387, captioned Keith Ernest Lamonica;
Dale Curtis Torno, FAG, 00: Seattle. Lamonica described
previous association with Bureau personnel while assigned as
‘investigative reporter with WMPS Radio, Memphis, Tennessee,
and also while working on the Yablonski murder cases in
Knoxville, Tennessee. Lamonica presently resides 31022 -
48th Avenue SW, Federal Way, Washington.

Lamonica indicated he has been working on captioned
case and although he did not previously believe of the existence
of "Raoul" theory as posed by James Earl Ray, he now has developed
information indicating that "Raoul" is actually Raoul Santiago
Estejo Martinez and that with the cooperation of Ray's
Attorney, Jack Kérshaw, he, Lamonica, is to. meet with Martinez
through .an interiiediary, Cliff Andrews, who supposedly served
prison time with Ray.

Lamonica further indicated that when this information
breaks; it will cause considerable publicity and he has already
been contacted by three major networks and leaves Thursday

Lantana, Florida, from where he will return to Seattle possibly
on Friday. He said approximately two weekends ago he was
interviewed by two investigators named Moriarty (PH), and Gilbert
from the House Select Committee on Assassinations who indicated
they would be subpoenaing Lamonica in the near future. At the
time of this interview Lamonica did not have the aforementioned
information on Raoul Martinez.. Martinez reportedly

indicated he will testify about captioned case if he can be

Lamonica's purpose in contacting Seattle FBI was to
express concern for the safety of his two daughters, Deborah
Angela, agé 7, and Dana Edna, age 6, who reside with his parents
at 4817 W. Richardson, Pasco, Washington, tel. 547-7935.

Reason for. his concern is that he had heard indirectly that a

New Orleans “hit man," Rafael Martinez (no relation to

Raoul Martinez). would cause him or his family alot of trouble
if the story breaks. He said his new source told him of a
confidential memo believed from Dallas, Texas, Police Department
‘or Sheriff's Office to New Orleans in which Martinez was
described as a very experienced hit man.

Lamonica advised by SAC of the witness protection.
program and that he should probably notify investigators for
Select Committee of his fears but to check with this office
upon his return this coming Friday.

Above furnished for information of Bureau for referral
to Department. All offices hold specific leads in abeyance
pending instructions from Bureau.”

BACKGROUND ON LAMONICA: Bufile 46-53387 reflects that Lamonica
was the subject of a Fraud Against

the Government case in 1966. Lamonica allegedly was in the

possession of a first-class radio teleplioné operator's license

registered to another individual as reported by the Federal

. Communications Commission. Federal présecution was declined.

BACKGROUND ON "RAOUL": Ray previously related to Author
Tt William Bradford Huie that "Raoul" was
an international gun-runner and he drove "Raoul" away from the crime
scene after the murder wholly unaware of the killing of King.
The "Pacific News Service" also previously reported that Ray
received instructions from "Raoul" in Memphis. Our prior investigation
never identified the existence of a "Raoul." A Task Force
of the Office of Professional Responsibility, U. Ss. Department of

Justice, recently reviewed our investigation of King and in

examining the "Raoul" allegations, concluded that "the task
force views -the exculpatory content of these varying and
patently self-serving tales to be unbelievable," and "we
concluded Ray was lying about the existence of a 'Raoul'."

Memoranduti ‘to ‘Mr. Fehi
RE: MURKIN

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CLIFF ANDREWS: lLamonica claims he is
to meet with Martinez
through an intermediary, Cliff Andrews. Although insufficient
identifying. data exists for the purposes of identification, in
1974, one Clifford Holms. Andrews. had been in contact with
Ray's attorney, Robert Livingston, and indicated his knowledge of,
and involvement in, a conspiracy re this matter. A District
Attorney General in Memphis and a Memphis attorney, who had been
in contact with Andrews, believed the revelations by Andrews
were a hoax perpetrated to swindle Livingston of funds. Andrews
was subsequently interviewed and denied’ any knowledge of the
King slaying.

RESULTS OF ‘FBIHQ INDICES CHECK ON RAOUL SANTIAGO ESTEJO MARTINEZ
AND RAFAEL MARTINEZ - THE ALLEGED “HITMAN. “

.Based on available identifying data, no pertinent information
was located in Bufiles concerning the above two individuals.

POLICY RE INVESTIGATING ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS:

By memorandum dated: 4/28/77,. captioned "House
Select Committee on Assassinations," we advised the Department
that in order to avoid duplication of investigative effort and
the attendant problems between the FBI and the HSCA that
could arise in the future, and until the jurisdiction of. this

Bureau in these investigations (both the King and Kennedy

cases) is delineated by the Department, the FBI will refer .
all allegations relating to these investigations to the

Department for its consideration as to whether any investigation

is required of the FBI, or whether the Department desires to

furnish ‘these allegations directly to the HSCA. Accordingly,

the information furnished by Lamonica will be furnished to the
Department and no investigation will be conducted unless
specifically requested by the Department. Our appropriate

field offices will be so advised. Also, our Seattle Office

is being advised to insure that Lamonica is cognizant of the
spécific provisions of the witness protection program, and

to advise him to. notify the appropriate local authorities

of the fears he has for his personal safety and that of his

family. . 8

suBJECT:Martin Luther King Assassination

On April 7, 1977, James Travis Buckley, J.B. Stoner and
I met in the United States Attorney's office in Jackson,
Mississippi, to complete discovery and work out stipulations
in United States v. James Travis Buckley, Criminal No. J76-
54(N). On May 14, 1977, Buckley, an attorney, was convicted
on five counts of failing to file income tax returns for
1970 through 1974 and three counts ssid tax evasion for 1970,
1973 and 1974.

During the conversation on April 7, 1977, J.B. Stoner
mentioned that he had recently received his Federal Bureau
of Investigation file covering 1483 pages under the Freedom
of Information Act. He stated that the file reveals that
the Federal Bureau of Investigation had bugged his auto- —
thobile and his telephone: He mentioned that the F.B.I. had
treated him like Martin Luther King. Stoner. went on to say
that in 1957 or 1958, he had been’approached by the’ head of
an Alabama Klavern of the Klu Klux-Kilan. Stoner said that
everyone knew that this man was an F.B.I. agent. Stoner
said that this individual offered him $25,000 to hire a
cifleman to kill Martin Luther King. He remarked to me that
he did not mind the F.B.I. killing an individual like Martin
Luther King but he did resent their attempt and the attempt
of the House Committee to pin the murder on a.Scapegoat,
James Earl Ray. (J.B. Stoner had represented James Earl Ray
on his appeal).

J.B. Stoner is one of the leading white supremacists
and anti-Semites in the nation. He is the president of the
National Stdtes' Rights Party and edits a recist newsletter,
Thunderbolt, in Marietta, Georgia.’ Special Agent William
Jack Sykes of Jackson, Mississippi, was also present when
Stoner made these comments.

NOTE: By teletype dated 8/10/77, captioned “Harold Weisberg
v. U.. S. Department of Justice (USDC), D.C. (Civil Action

No. 75-1996), Freedom of Information Act Matter, Bureau
Deadline August 31, 1977," to all above offices exécept

Miami, instructions were issued to reproduce MURKIN files for
FOI-PA regarding Weisberg's law suit. FOI~PA purposes,
however, did not require serialization accounting and the
field was instructed to include only documents. not directed
to or received from FBIHQ and Memphis.

Recipients of this teletype have been contacted
telephonically in an effort to coordinate these two projects
involving the MURKIN files.

Offices in question were determined by the HSCA to
be key offices in the MURKIN investigation. By letter
dated. 7/28/77, the HSCA requested field office files with
the exception of Chicago and St. Louis, which were added
at the conference on 8/16/77. Field office Files involved
consist of approximately 150 sections and 12,500 serials.

At the meeting on 8/16/77, HSCA officials desired
that the Congressional Inquiry Unit (CIU) review all incoming
field office serials and check each against the FBIHQ and
Memphis files to insure that all communications were
actually received and filed. This request was rejected and
a compromise was reached whereby the CIU will check a small
random sampling of field serials to verify their
existence in either the FBIHQ or Memphis file.

Meeting on 8/16/77, at the HSCA office was attended
by Mr. Blakey and Robert Lehner of the HSCA; D. 0. Coulson
of the Legal Counsel Division and J. T. Aldhizer of the CIU.
In addition, this matter was coordinated on 8/17/77, with
Robert Keuch, Special Counsel to the Attorney General, who
is conducting liaison with the HSCA for the Department of
Justice.

be Dear Mr. Kelley: rapes, COVRRRHENE .

As you are aware, I have received a number of investigative
summaries on staff personnel of my Committee. These have been
extremely helpful. However, the information contained in four of
the summaries is of such a nature that I feel it prudent and proper
to review as much additional supporting data as might be readily

available in order to render a fair and balanced judgment in these nN
cases. In effect, the summaries do reflect somewhat noteworthy Mu
comments by certain acquaintances, and it is quite important to ay]
determine whether there is an offsetting information which would aN
serve to place the cases in better perspective from a security standpoint.\

In view of the above, I would be most appreciative if you would x». By

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S&S, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

RE: JUNE 16, 1977, REQUEST OF HSCA FOR ACCESS
TO ALL MATERIALS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE
FBI RELATING TO JAMES EARL RAY'’S ESCAPES
AND ATTEMPTED ESCAPES FROM PRISONS.

This will respond to the letter dated June 16, 1977,
to the Attorney General from U. S. Congressman Louis Stokes,
Chairman, HSCA.

ALL FBI investigative results of James Earl Ray as a
fugitive, subsequent to his escape from the Missouri State
Penitentiary at Jefferson City, Missouri, on April 23, 1967,
were consolidated into the FBI's civil rights assassination
file pertaining to Martin luther King, dr., (44~38861,
abbreviated as the “MURKIN" file) which has already been
available for HSCA access.

All other references retrievable in FBI Headquarters’
files regarding Ray, including information concerning his
escape on June 10, 1977, from the Brushy Mountain State Prison,
Petros, Tennessee, have now been processed and are available

ip for HSCA access at FBIHQ.

The FBI has no topical index to the other alleged
escapes or attempted escapes mentioned by the HSCA, however,
a thorough review by personnel of the HSCA of the NURKIN
file, as well as the additional references now processed on
Ray, will permit the HSCA to retrieve any information contained
Asoc. py, _vherein which it considers pertinent to the alleged escape

IN POSSESSION OF THE FBI PERTAINING TO MORRIS .
DAVIS, FRANK LIBERTO, VINCENT LIBERTO, ANTHONY
LIBERTO, SALVATORE LIBERTO, JOHN MC FERREN,
OTIS HUMPHREY MOORE, AND LOUIS LOMAX

This will respond to a May 13, 1977 letter to
the Federal Bureau of Investigation from Stephen J. Fallis,.
Deputy Chief Counsel, HSCA, relating to information in
possession of the FBI concerning Morris Davis, Frank
Liberto, Vincent Liberto, Anthony Liberto (listed on the
May 13, 1977 HSCA memorandum as "Alberto" Liberto, however,
believed should be Anthony Liberto), Salvatore Liberto,
John Me Ferren, Otis Humphrey Moore, and Louis Lomax.

Morris Davis previously furnished information
to the FBI concerning the. assassination of Martin Luther
King, Jr., or a confidential basis and this information
aAs.:contained in the FBI's civil rights assassination file
pertaining to King (#%=38861, abbreviated as the "MURKIN"
file) which has already’ been available for HSCA ‘access with
thé namie of Mr. Morris protected as the source of this infor-
mation. Based upon this May 13, 1977 request, Mr. Morris was

Accordingly, the riame of Mr. Morris has now been included

tained in the MURKIN file and is available for HSCA access.

Assoc. Din, ALL references to the other individuals. listed

In addition, based upon a review of FBI Head~
quarters indices, all other pertinent material pertaining
to those listed Individuals in the files of FBI Headquarters
has been processed and is now available for HSCA access at
FBI Headquarters.



HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

NOTE: By memorandum dated 3/9/77, the HSCA requested
information in possession of the FBI pertaining to the
listed individuals. Insufficient identifying data was
provided and by memorandum dated 5/13/77, the HSCA fur-
nished available identifying data pertaining to this
request.

The HSCA requested information pertaining to Morris
Davis who is a former potential criminal informant of the
Birmingham office and who has furnished some information
re MURKIN to the Birmingham office wherein he requested his
identity be protected. This information pertains to the
involvement of Frank Liberto, et al. In 1968 we conducted
an extensive investigation concerning Liberto who was employed
at a produce company where a conversation was allegedly over-
heard concérning a threat aginst King prior to his assassination.
All investigation conducted concerning the Liberto matter was
disseminated to the Department and no additional investigation
was requested. Davis subsequently was in contact with the
HSCA direct concerning his information. On 5/31/77 as set
forth in a Birmingham teletype, dated 5/31/77, Davis advised
his name could now be provided to the HSCA as the source of
the information he furnished which is contained in the MURKIN
file.

This responds to this HSCA request advising that
pertinent information is available in the MURKIN file and
in addition, all other pertinent references. to the listed
individuals have been processed (making appropriate excisions,
etc.,). and are now available for HSCA access. The HSCA
initially requested information on Anthony Liberto and
apparently this name was incorrectly transposed by the
HSCA as "Alberto" Liberto in the 5/13/77 request when
the name actually should be Anthony. All responses to
HSCA access are made through Mr. Keuch of the Department
who was appointed by the Attorney General to. be Special
Counsel for the Department in matters re the HSCA. —

NOTE: In April, 1977, Senator Melcher wrote, enclosing

an article from "The Review of the News", a publication

printed in Belmont, Massachusetts. This article supported

the FBI's investigation of King and criticized the Senate
Intelligence Committee for refusing to release the FBI

file on King and his electronic surveillance results. |
Melcher did not request a reply, but stated that allegations

of Communist influence on King and his associates should be
investigated and that surveillance records on King should

not be kept secret.

In response to this letter, we outlined the |
basis for our investigation of King. We stated allegations
of Communist connections have been investigated, with results
furnished appropriate agencies of the Government. Regarding
Melcher's reference to surveillance records, we referred him
to a recent court decision which ordered all tapes and
documents obtained from our electronic surveillance of King
to be sent to the National Archives and not to be made public
for 50 years, except by court order. This decision was
rendered in two civil suits filed against the FBI by a former
assistant to King and the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, which King headed until his death.

In his second letter, Melcher states he is not
requesting actual electronic tapes or other material gathered
during our surveillance of King and his associates. He asked
that results of our King investigation be made public.

This matter was coordinated with SA R. C. Dennis,
Freedom of Information = Privacy Acts Branch.

Assictent Attorney General
Criminal Division
Attention: Mr. Robert L. Eeuch

the FBI did have two electronic surveillances in effect in Atlantic City

during the period of the Convention. One was a telephone surveillance

on an individual at a hotel. The other was a niicrophone surveillance at

a storefront jointly occupied by to organizatienas. We bélieve that the
implication of an FBI eloctronic surveillance at the Convention site is

of such serious significance that the facts in this matter should be brought

to the attention of the ESCA in any furnishing to it of the Murphy memorandum.

Page 9 of the Pottinger report contains a statement, "The files
reflect that the Bureau's action, especially in mailing of the tape, .. ."
{This refers to a mailing of a tape to the fing household in Atlanta, Georgia).
From all records available at the FBI there appears to be no doubt that a
tape was mailed to the King family. There is no record in our filos, nor
has any individual come forward with any information, to indicate that the
mailing of the tape was an official FBI action. Rather, the indication is
that the mailing of the tape was by on individual who was then en Assistant
Director of the | FBI but with no indication it was with the approval of any
higher authority, inclading the late Director, J. Edgar Hoover. We have
previously indicated this position-to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities (Church Committee) and to the Department. I is
believed that our position relating to the mailing of the tape should be
made known to the ESCA in the event it ia furnished the Pottinger report.

CG By letter dated 6-6-77°to the Assistant Attorney "*"**""-

General, Criminal Division, Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch,
the Bureau discussed a report prepared by former Assistant
Attorney General J. Stanley Pottinger, Civil Rights Division,
pertaining to the Department's review of our files in the
King investigation; and a memorandum of Robert A, Murphy,
Former Chief, Criminal Section, Civil Rights Division, which
was an enclosure to the Pottinger report. Our letter
primarily addressed the matter of excisions necessary as the
4 HSCA had requested access to these documents. However, there
was additionally pointed out in our letter certain inaccuracies
in the Murphy memorandum.

. On 7-14-77 I, along with Supervisors J, T. Aldhizer,
D. Ryan, and M. J. Steinbeck, met with Mr. Keuch in his office

to discuss the matter of necessary excisions, classification

problems, etc., relating to the Murphy memorandum prior to the

heed Department's furnishing of it to the HSCA. At the conclusion

NS of this meeting, I raised with Mr. Keuch the matter of

a inaccuracies in the Murphy memorandum which our letter dated

ha 6-6-77 detailed. He advised that in furnishing the Murphy

7 memorandum to the HSCA he intended to include a recitation of

the inaccuracies as claimed by us. I then raised with him

‘Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: House Select Committee On Assassinations (HSCA)

OBSERVATIONS :

The manner and context in which this statement appears
very strongly implies, indeed some might justifiably claim it
actually says that there was an electronic surveillance (by the
FBI) on the floor or elsewhere in the Auditorium where the
Convention took place. We know of no such electronic surveillance
by us or anyone else that I am familiar with. True, we had
such surveillances at two other Atlantic City sites at the time --
one in a hotel and one in a storefront. It seems to me that
there is a vast difference in terms of impact, any abuse of
power, etc, ,between such coverage at the Convention site as
opposed to elsewhere in the city. We have been subject to
considerable criticism relating to motivation behind past
acts, some justified, some not so. Surely we should not be
placed in the position of being vulnerable to completely
unjustifiable criticism which we will surely be if the quoted
statement is furnished to the HSCA without attention being
drawn to its inaccuracies.

(2) Page 9 of the Pottinger report contains a
statement, "The files reflect that the Bureau's action,
especially the mailing of the tape,...".

OBSERVATIONS :

The Bureau has consistently taken the position,
in writing and orally, with the Church Committee and the
Department that the mailing of the tape was not an official
FBI action, or with the approval of Director Hoover.
Our position has been that the mailing of the tape was the
singular action of a Bureau official with no known sanction
and with the unwitting aid of other FBI employees. It seems
to me that if we have made this claim to others before, we
need to again make it in the context of this report which
is to be disseminated to the HSCA.

“In the strongest terms, and with the FBI as the prime
consideration, it is urged that these inaccuracies be brought
to Mr. Keuch's attention in writing.

This will confirm the telephone conversation at

Inquiry Unit, and Joseph F. Gross, Jr., of my staff concerning
Appendix C to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Task Force Report.

It is my understanding that your review and classification
of Appendix C is complete, But the appendix contains material
relating to sensitive sources which the Bureau would want to gj 7
review for excision if the app ix is ever disseminated to in
interested parties such as the House Select. Conmittee on
Assassinations.

Mr. Gross has also advised me that during the time in
which this additional review may be necessary the Bureau
has agreed to retain custody of the appendix. After this
périod. the appendix is to be returned’-to, this Office.

Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. 7 4
