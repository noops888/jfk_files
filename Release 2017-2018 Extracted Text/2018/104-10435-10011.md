to Hoynes on 26 December that Mr..George/Brown had received a disturbing
telephone call on Friday, 22 Decenber 1967..from Hugh Aynesworth, Houston
Bureau reporter for Newsweek Magazine.- Ayneésworth told Brown that he had
received information from Bill Gervage (spelling?), former assistant to
Hew Orleans District Attorney James Garrison, that Garrison might try to
implicate Brova in the "Kennedy assassination plot".

’ 3, ‘the altegatton ts that in come unspecified mamer, Brown was
involved with the CIA ta its objective of "covering up” the “conapizacy”
for President Jobnson. Aynesuorth said Gervage has documents, including
at least one in Garrison’s own handwriting, which presumably have been
extracted from Garrison'o files. Aynesworth indicated that, if,desired,
be could secure these docunents from Gervage for review by Browns,

+ In view of Brown's close cooperation with the Agency in its),
anding operations, Brown asked Frensley to commatcate this information
to Haynes. It is reported to Headquarters only as a matter of informa~",
