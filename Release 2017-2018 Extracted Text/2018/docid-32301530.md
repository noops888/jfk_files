the following day, 8/13/64, the Mahoning County Sheriff's

Office secured a

search warrant and recovered other evidence,

and again the defense filed

a motion to supress the

evidence, at which

time the judge again stated he would have

to study this motion before

ruling.

Current attempts are

being made by the Mahoning County

Sheriff's Office, Youngs-

town, to have the evidence presented directly to a

grand jury

for indictment.

RE: DOMINICK MALLAMO, aka "Big Dom", Calabrese organizatio leader

CV 544-C advised on 9/24/64, he was approached

by MALIAMO, who asked him if he had been at the Tropies Lounge,

Market Street, Youngstown, recently or if any of the boys

from the C.M.A.S. Club had been there. He stated he told

MALLAMO he had not been to the Tropies and knew of no one from

the club who had been there, although he knew that toNy Bruno,

the present steward of the C.M.A.S. Club had been there two

nights before.

MALLAMO told

him he was glad to hear that no

one from the Club had been at the Tropics and told CV 544-C

to tell the boys to stay away from the tropics and not go

there any more because the crowd hanging around there is no

good.

RE: LOCAL GAMBLING AND RACKETEERING

CV 544-0 stated that recently JASPER JOSEPH AIELLO, JR. s

aka "Fats"

, apprached JOHN "POPEYE" STEVENS and asked STEVENS

if he was connected with EUGENE MC NAMARA, as they were. taking

NC NANARA In as a partner and STEVENS tOld AlELLO he was out

of the gambling business entirely. Then later STEVENS received

an anonymous phone call at his home threatening him that if he

was still in business he should get out, and not say he is out

of business and actually be in business,

or in this way he

could get hurt.

DAN PETRICK, PCI, advised that NELLO RONCI, local

gambler, cheater at gambling games, and racketeer, is in

the

same group as LOU TIBERIO, owner of the Tropics Lounge,

and JASPER JOSEPH AIELLO, JR.,

aka

"Fats"

, which frequent the

tropics.

He stated this group is operating with full police

protection,

and they have no fears of being raided at any

time.

stated RONCI recently purchased a poolroom

(Past Time Billiards) located below the Tropics on the same

side of the street (next door to the Shang-Ri-La) from BERNIE

ALTSCHULER, another gambling hustler, who is currently

in Florida.

He stated he feels this

group may be banking

their bets at this poolroom, as it is only a short distance

below the Tropics. He also

stated he has heard that this

group is not using the upstairs of the Tropies for banking

their gambling operation.

CV 559-PC advised that the group hanging around

the Tropics is becoming very powerful in gambling operations

consisting of numbers, horses and sports bets.

He stated

that EUGENE MC NAMARA

has broken from his operation with

JOHN BURNICH and went into the gambling business for himself.

MC NAMARA came to the informant one day and asked him if he

wanted to be a

50 per cent partner with him inasmuch as he

has taken over

much of informant's former stops.

he told MC NAMARA that if he wanted to be in the business

he would be in it 100 per cent, and would split with no one,

and In view of this MC NAMARA could have any business he wanted

and should not even contact him regarding any problems as he

was out entirely.

CV 559-PC stated a few days later he was approached

by AIELLO and AIELLO asked him "if I would ask you some

questions, would you

give me a truthful answer?"

Informant

stated he

told AIELLO that if the questions were such that he

felt he could answer them he would answer truthfully, and

if they were such that he felt he could not answer truth-

fully, he would answer by telling AIELLO "I can't answer that.

AIELLO said that was fine and better than he expected. AlELLO

then asked the

informant if he was in the

gambling business

with EUGENE MC NAMARA, and informt stated he was not, has

not been, and has no intentions of doing same.

AIELLO stated

he was happy to learn this and happy that CV 559-PC spoke so

truthfully and then said that he and his group (which according

to CV 559-PC

consists of RONALD DAVID CARABBIA, DOMINIC P.

LOU TIBERLOS MARILLO VELIRIS aRa

"New York

TACK DId TANGS PETRELIA, aks "Dankers", and possibly others)

are considering taking MC NAMARA into their organization, but

CV 92-621

they wanted to know for sure whether or not CY 559-P0 is

connected with MC NAMARA.

He stated he also told AIELLO

that he doesn't want anyone coming to him complaining to

him about MC NAMARA, or how MC NAMARA does business,

or

that MC NAMARA is not paying his bills, because he has

nothing to do with MC NAMARA.

CV 559-PC stated this group is attempting to

monopolize the gambling business in Youngstown and apparently

He stated

they have apparent full police protection, and know the FBI

has the Tropies Lounge under surveillance and for tis reason,

Inasmuch as they congregate so in the open at the tropics,

they are not banking their business there, and that is

done elsewhere and they have nothing to fear at the Tropics

and would welcome a raid to further inflate themselves in the

eyes of the

public, and their associates, that they cannot

be touched.

CV 278-C-TE advised that JAMES PETRELIA, aka "Dankers",

has closed his 98

club in downtown Youngstown, and

placed his liquor license in escrow, inasmuch as the State

of onlo would have closed the place for non-payment of taxes.

him he would like to see him.

Informant agreed, and AIELLO,

accompanied by IEO MOCERI,

aka "Lips", (close associate of

JAMES dAVOL, aKa Jack white, of Cleveland, picked him up

wIth AlELLO driving MOCERI's Cadillac. He stated they drove

to a restaurant and drank coffee and

spent a good deal of time

MOCERI asked irformant about his partner (MICKEY SAFFRON,

owner oi Saliron Cigarette Service) and informant stated he

as no partners and he only works for SAFFRON. MOCERI ther

asked Informant if he minded if he, MOCERI and AIELLO would

a amartment

shake SAFFRON for a couple hundred dollars, and informant stated

he wouldn't mind as long as they gave him a

money, and MOCERI promised informant he would give him $50 If

successful. MOCERI also asked informant about the City of

Cut range rate

Campbell,

as he had heard that informant had all of the pool

tables in Campbell on location.

CV 278-C-TE stated this was

not true,

that he had none,

and he then mentioned to AIELLO

that he was not doing any of the talking, at which time AJELLO

CV 278-C-TE stated that both MOCERI and AIELLO in-

dicated they could work with the informant, and he then

stated they asked him about unionizing the pool table operators.

Inasmuch as they are not under union protection at the

present time, although the cigarette vendors and music box

operators area.

Informant stated he told them this would be

a good idea, and asked MOCERI how this would stand with JOE

FONTANA and

LOUIS "BABE" TRISCARO of the Vending Machine Union

in Cleveland, to which MOCERI replied, "they're with us."

CV 278-C-TE stated this is the same way that AJELLO

began his operation years ago when he started thé National

Cigarette Service in Youngstown,

AIELLO stole every cigarette

machine location he could and whenle developed a substantial

route, he used the Teamster's Union in Cleveland to come in

and organize

the vendors and in this way the Union told each

operator that he couldn't steal one location from another

operator, and they had to hold the locations they had as of

that date, and in this way AlEIIO was protected.

Both CV 278-C-Te and CV 544-0 expect there will be

some kind of trouble arising out of the activities of the

group at the Tropies.

The Bureau has been previously advised that ANTHONY

DELSANTER of Warren lost his position with the

"organization"

in Warren and Trumbull County because he used "organization"

funds for AlELLO's

bond after he was apprehended by Bureau.
