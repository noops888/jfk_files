MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
FROM : | John H. Waller
Inspector Genera]
SUBJECT :.. Mr. George de Mohrenschildt
REFERENCE : . Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter to you,

dated 5 September 1976

Action Required:

1. None. . This:memorandum is for your information.’ We have also
attached at'A a suggested draft reply to Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter.

Action Taken:

2. -We have reviewed DDO and IG files on Mr. de Mohrenschildt: In
addition, at our request, the CI Staff has run Agency traces on him and
has been in touch with the FBI as well.

Findings: . ae

3. There. is voluminous material on Mr. .de. Mohrenschildt in CIA
files, most of it dating from the post-Kennédy assassination period
when he testified before the Warren Commission on his acquaintance
with Mr. and Hrs. Lee Harvey Oswald.’ (A copy of the de Mohrenschildts’
testimony is attached at B.)

4. The bulk of the material ‘in our: files consists of FBI reports,
the.most recent of which is dated 1967. The FBI has informed CIA that
it has no traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt beyond that date; our files -
contain all of its previous material on him. .

5. Mr. Helms’ 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on
the de Mohrenschildts is attached at C. It describes the Agency's
interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now
Domestic Coliection Division - DCG) had its resident agent in Dallas,
Yr. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. © The
history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt from 1957
to 1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested
traces on fir. de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached at D) con-
tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive
contact with the de Nohrenschildts. (An 0S summary on fir. de Mohrenschildt
prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.

6. Our files show that a mail cover was ‘placed on letters addressed
to Mr. de Mohrenschiidt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to
1966: - (This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external. in-
vestigations.) This “included opening and photographing the contents of
some letters by the CIA Stat there) The results of this operation
were shared with the FBI.

7. Mr. de Mohrenschildt came, to the attention of this office during
the Rockefeller Commission investigations. We were asked to respond to a
memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA
Activities. and the Warren Commission Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for
an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and
asked what Mr. Moore knew about. Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de
Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is
attached at £. e

8. The most recent information we have on Mr. de.tiohrenschildt comes
from Mr.-J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and duly 1976 by writers
connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press:and the Dell
Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and
Mr. de Mohrenschildt.~ Kir, Moore's reports on these contacts are attached
at F.

Conclusions: :

9. Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous and
colorful life as a-petroleum engineer and businessman. He ‘is both well

and poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have
raised serious questions. Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has ‘caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this
Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy on him in the past

than was necessary.

10. . Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their
interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's: activities by the mid-to-late
1960's... We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could
either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-
tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination
of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond
Nir. Moore's reports attached at F. What we can say’is that we have
found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.

Dear George:

Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.
It ad time to explore thoroughly the matters you raised. r

Let me say first that I know it must have been “difficult for you
to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I
~ can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic
, death a few years ago and the.current poor state of your wife's health.
I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. *

In your situation, I can well imagine how the attentions you
described in your letter affect both you and your wife.. However, my
staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your
activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. The
flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren
Commission has long since subsided.: I can only speculate that you
may have becone “newsworthy” again in view of the renewed interest
in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may be attracting the atten-
tion of people in the media.

I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George,
although I realize I-am unable to answer your question completely.
Thank you for your good wishes on my new job. As you can iinagine,
I'm finding it interesting and challenging.

Very truly yours,

Swbjoct was investigated by Federal Agencies in 19h, Ihe,
195, 19:7, and 1957.. The investigation reports as well as the
files of other Federal Agencies reflect the following:

Between 19h0 and 1942 Subject was considered to be
pro-Gernan.and suspected of being a Cerman propagandist and
an espionage agent.

Several informants stated that Subject vas in sympathy
with the Conmmist form of governnent in Russia but lnew of no

advised in 19h? that, Subject had definite Commmistic tenden~ ’
cies. : : ; ;

Investigations failed to produce any legal compstent
evidence or witnesses to substantiate the reports that & Subject
had been pro-Coumunist or prolazi.

Vajority of infornants consider Subject to be eccentric,
Arresponsible, conceited, an adventurer fond of cvaggeration, ana
overly aggressive.

: Subject has been known to associate with persons cot
questionable loyalty, reputation, and moral character.

Subject, when interviewed, admitted that he tends to exag-
gerate and advised that he thought the Communist form of govern~
ment. of Soviet Russia was the better form of government on the -
European continent, and that he had a great adniretion for the
Communistic form of government, but that that did not prevent -..
him from having a stronger fecling of loyalty to the goverment

George DE MOHRENSCHILDT

From the Office of Security

CIA CONNECTION:

DE MOHRENSCHILDT was security disapproved for OSS employ-
ment on 18 July 1942 because he was suspected of being a Nazi

“agent. On 13 August 1958 derogatory information was furnished

the Contact Office who was interested in interrogating him as
an alien contact. His second wife, Phyllis who he married on
11 July 1948.and divorced 29 December 1949, was employed as a
receptionist by a.covert project (NCFE) from 1950 to 12 _January
1951 when her employment was terminated. (Reason not given.)

Subject's brother, Dimitri S. VON MOHRENSCHILDT, was
approved on. 11 ‘April 1950 for exploitation as.a contact. for
foreign intelligence purposes on a limited baSis; not -to receive
classified information above confidential. x

OS. INDICES: RESULTS:

OS Files on Subject, his second wife, and his brother
reflect use by the Agency as set out above. Subject was
investigated by the FBI.in 1941, 1942, 1945, 1947 and 1957.
Between 1940 and 1942 Subject was considered to be pro-German
and suspected.of being a German propagandist and an espionage

_ agent. Several informants stated that Subject was in sympathy

with the Communist form of government in Russia but knew of

no un-American activities on the part of Subject.~ One infor-
mant advised in 1947 that Subject had definite Communistic --
tendencies. However, investigations failed to produce any
legal competent evidence or witnesses to-substantiate the
reports that Subject had been pro-Communist or pro-Nazi. The
majority of informants consider Subject to-be eccentric,
irresponsible, conceited, an adventurer fond of exaggeration .
and overly aggressive. He has been known to. associate with
persons of questionable loyalty, reputation and moral character.
Subject has admitted that he tends to exaggerate and stated
that he thought the Communist form of government of Soviet
Russia was the better form of government on the European



continent; that he had a great admiration for the Communist
form of government but that this admiration did not prevent him
from having a stronger feeling of loyalty to the government of

the United States.

A New York Times item for 12 December 1966 mentioned that
George DE MOHRENSCHILDT has been acquainted with Jacqueline
KENNEDY'’s father, John. BOUVIER, and mother, Mrs. Hugh AUCHIN-
CLOSS, since Mrs. KENNEDY was a girl. The DE MOHRENSCHILDT's
were quoted as. saying they were perhaps the only persons in
the world to have known the families of both President KENNEDY

and OSWALD.

Mr. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division

with the Oswald easel prior to the assassination is recorded in
his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact
Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed version of the décument

1. On the evening of 13 July 1976, at about 2100, Mr- Richard
Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by
my house. He advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy
assassination and that he understood I was a friend of George
deHohrenschildt. He wanted to know if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald
or if detohrenschildt. had ever suggested that I should see Oswald.
I told him no on both counts and advised that.I have not seen ar
talked with George deHohrenschildt since the fall of 1961.

2. Mr. Russel] attempted to draw me into discussion of the
Kennedy assassination which I avoided and wanted to know if I could
give him the name of the chief of tha CIA office in Mexico City in

* 3963. I told him I could not, and he said he could probably get the

name from Mr. David Pail ips. I do not foresee any adverse publicity
as a result of. Hr. Russell's visit but felt that it should be made a.

Subject: W.L.OLTNANS (10 June 1925)

On 29 December 1971 OLTNAN§ invited the Cultural Attache of the
Russian Embassy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house. The invit-
ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representation,
At the same time OLTNANS was to invite some six important journalists
KUZNETSOV should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with him,
The date agreed’ on originally was 11 January 1972."It then was
changed, twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitablé, it was, agreed
on 7 January to make the date for 18.January “1972 at 20,00 hrs,
From the invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted
to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTMANS with
the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section,B is able to
report the following:

(This information comes from vulnerable source = OPPERBAAS.) |

1, In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-
ly received an invitation to a party at the Russian Embassy.
He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But
his thinking is along the lines of those people.

2. In October 1970 OLTMANS appears to be interested in an interview
with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly was connected
with. American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think-
ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a ‘role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the state committee for science
and technology and is suspected to be a highly. placed
Intelligence Officer. a

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV
from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an
interview with GVISHIANI.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate
with the Nos, (TV),

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very
extensive.

4, Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the
Club of Rome, OLTNANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-
ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris. «
Also present at this discussion was the former member-of the Russi:
Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee
for science and technology.

At this opportunity GVISHIANI immediately invited OLTMANS for a
visit to Noscow. .
FEDEROVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Embassy in The
Yegue about it.

GVISHIANI who. at the same time is chairman of the commission for
environment administration in the Soviet’ Union, asked OLTMANS to
make a film at the same time about the environment administration
in the Soviet Union to support the international, environment
conference to be held this year. 5

Begining May it becomes clear that since OLTNANS! discussion with
GVISHIANI, OPALEV's attitude towards. OLTNANS has greatly changed.
OPALEV is now all. willingness,

In May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI and receives an inv-
itatiom to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August
and the whole of September, where he could film ten scientific
institutes.

GVISHIANI told OLTMANS that he had complete trust in him.

In June 1971 OLTMANS again contacted GVISHIANI, this time in
Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of Rome.

Begining October 1971 OLTMANS again saw GVISHTANI in Paris, where,

among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The Netherlan|

in the second week of October.
OLTMANS did his begt to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-
erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for
instance with Philips).

. receweel
In November 1971 OLJMANS, from the Russian state television an
offer for a five year cohitract to make exclusive films in. the

Soviet Union, =

This offer was made to OLTMANS ers his visit to the Soviet
Union, It is concretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to
film a number of scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.

On 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further
with GVISHTANI in Geneva.

On 23 January 1972 OLTNANS will make another visit to Moscow to
discuss making the above mentioned films without the participation
of the NOS, At this opportunity OLTNANS will leave’ behind a memo
about LUNS in connection with OLTMANS! present agitation against.
the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTMANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to
visit Moscow.

Referring to the meeting in OLTNANS' house on 18 January 1972 it
can be reported that on 17 January 1972 OLTMANS stated that he
is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him on
18 January; their reaction in connection with OLTMANS' request
to the general prosecutor of the High Council to bring action
against LUNS.

In the morning on 18 January OLTNANS also stated that KUZNETSOV
said that OLTMANS' action against LUNS will not succeed because
the "bosses" stand behind LUNS.

It is not clear when KUZNETSOV said this ‘to OLTMANS, but it is
known that OLTNANS recently at tended a meeting where a number
of Russians were present.

(Possibly the meeting of the Association "Nederliid-USSR" with
the delegation from "USSR-Nederland" on 14 January 1972.

on 19 January 1972 it was reported that HOFLAND: (one of the guest
invited to the evening in OLTMANS' house) called before his
arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend..

Afterwards ‘this friend appeared to be Peter ZONNEVELD from De
Telegraaf.

OLTMANS said that at the press conference which he (oirans)
will give on 20 January 1972 several guests, Milo ANSTADT, Rob . '
KOPUIT and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against the attack on
him in "De Telegraaf" of this ‘morning. .

19 January 1972.
