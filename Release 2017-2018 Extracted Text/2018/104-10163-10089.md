é THis is UNEVALUATED INFORMATION.

Guban national, a medical doctor, who resides in exile in the US. Since $
1962, he has been aseocieted with active anti-Goc organizations in the .
US and throughout Latin America.

(rhis report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office 2
‘of preparation.)

cf
i

Late in 1965, General Anastacio Somoza, Director, Nattonsl Guard of Nicaragua,
was @ patient in Baltimore's John Hopkins Hospital for roximarely one
month. 1 vighted the General at the hospital in two occasions and was
appalled at appearance; he was @ very sick man, He was suffering

from hepatitie and had had @ nervous breakdown, As part of the treatment,

. he was placed on @ very strict diet, and advised to stop drinking. Presently,
“-\. Somoza fe following the diet rel igiously; he takes @ sugar gubstitute

with his coffee, and has drastically curtailed h drinking. Apparently

the diet hee been successful, for Somoza has lose much weight.

In February 1966, 1 visited Nicaragua and called on General Somoza on &
business matter. He appeared healty, strong and wae in jovial spirit.
We discussed politics ; and hie pret ential candidacy for next years elac+
“ehons. He ie confident about the outcome of th elections; there is no
doubt in hie mind that he will bs the next President of Nicaragua.

a eee

In my opinion, behind the confidence and optimism is the nagging fact
that the Somosa name is sutcc ically identified with dictatorships. He
would like to change the image the Somoza name has create’, throughout
.Zatin America, This his real motivation in seeking the presidency, and |
abandoning the directorship of the onal Guerd. He refoices in the
fact that President Shick, & duly elected president, WLEL serve his &ut?
term and will be succeeded by another elected president. Somoza has oll
intentions of stepping aside at the end of his ters in Zaver 7f the thea
“elected president. He izes the Somoza name’to ba synonyut of prosperity, -,
stabiiity end democracy in Nicaragua. a “
