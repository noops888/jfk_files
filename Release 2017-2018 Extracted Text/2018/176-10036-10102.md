VISIT TO THE MILITARY SCHOOL, THE ENTIRE TIME WAS. DEVOTED TO PRIVATE

TALKS. MEMBERS OF THE CHEN ENTOURAGE WERE NOT NOTIFIED: UNTIL THE

LAST MOMENT OF THE REVISED SCHEDULE NOR WERE THEY GIVEN ANY INDICATION

AS TO THE CONTENT OF THE DISCUSSIONS.

3. MEMBERS OF THE CHINAT DELEGATION AND OF THE CHINAT DIPLOMATIC

COMMUNITY SPECULATED THAT THE TWO MAIN TOPICS OF CONVERSATION WERE.

GREATLY INCREASED CHINAT MILITARY SUPPORT FOR SOUTH VIETNAM, AND THE

USE OF SOUTH VIETNAM AS A BASE FOR CHINAT MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST

THE CHINA MAINLAND. CHEN IS BELIEVED TO HAVE OFFERED DI EM UNRESTRICTED

MILITARY TRAINING. AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, PLUS UP TO ONE DIVISION OF

COMBAT TROOPS TO FIGHT IN VIETNAMESE ARMY UNIFORMS:: CHEN IS ALSO

THOUGHT TO HAVE ASKED DIEM TO CEASE DRAFTING OVERSEAS CHINESE IN

VIETNAM, WHICH IS CAUSING THE CHINATS EMBARASSMENT, 1.E., DEMONSTRATIONS

BY THESE LOCAL CHINESE AGAINST THE CHINAT EMBASSY IN SAIGON AND

APPEALS TO THE CHINAT AMBASSADOR.. CHEN PROBABLY ASKED DIEM TO PUB-

LICLY SUPPORT THE CHINAT MAINLAND COUNTERATTACK THEME AND TO GRANT AIR-

FIELD AND COASTAL BASES FOR CHINAT MILITARY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE

OPERATIONS AGAINST THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF CHINA.

OTHER LIKELY TOPICS OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO MEN WERE THE

CONDUCTING OF JOINT OPERATIONS INTO NORTH VIETNAM: AND LAOS, THE

MATTER OF THAILAND'S MOVEMENT TOWARDS NEUTRALITY, AND JOINT EFFORTS

TO UNSEAT CAMBODIA'S SIHANOUK, WHOM THE CHINATS FEEL IS: A LACKEY OF

PEIPING. CONCENSUS AMONG THE CHINAT COMMUNITY AND CHEN'S DELEGATION

WAS THAT SOME ACCORD WAS REACHED BY THE TWO LEADERS, AS CHEN WAS IN

EXCELLENT SPIRITS AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS VISIT.

4. -ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT SLOW IN GETTING STARTED, THE VISIT DID

RESULT IN BRINGING THE TWO GOVERNMENTS CLOSER TOGETHER, PARTICULARLY

THE COUNTERPARTS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. THE VISIT ALSO SERVED A

USEFUL PURPOSE IN EFFECTIVELY IMPRESSING THE LOCAL CHINESE POPULATION,

WHICH TURNED OUT MORE OR LESS SPONTANEOUSLY IN AN ESTIMATED ONE: HUNDRED

THE

THOUSAND ALONG THE

ROUTE TO/AIRPORT TO CHEER CHEN WHEN HE.

DEPARTED. THE APPARENTLY GENUINE ENTHUSIASM OF THE USUALLY APATHETIC

VIETNAMESE CHINESE CAME AS A SURPRISE EVEN TO THE LOCAL CHINAT

DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY.
