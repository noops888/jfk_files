"a punk" and never hai any heodlum connections or associations. One
person advised that he recalls that RUBY attempted to sneak into a
prize fight in Chicago, believed to be the second DEMPSEY - TUNNEY
fight, and was caught by a police officer who beat him over the head
with his night stick. As a result of this beating, RUBY now has e
plate in his head. Apparently this causes pressure when RUBY becomes
excited and causes RUBY to ect emotionally.
