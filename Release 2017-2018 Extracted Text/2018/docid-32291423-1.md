DL 94-55A-SUB

On 3/21/63, Bureau Agents noted that LITTLE's car was

gone from his Irving, Texas residence at 8:30 AM, which is a

departure from his usual routine. Efforts are being made to locate

his new place of operation.

On 3/21/63, PCI MICHAEL LESCHETSKO advised that recent

activity by Bureau Agents around the Redmen Club, 3109 West Davis,

had caused the members to become quite upset to the point where

they now had signs in the club room, demanding that members play

cards only, not discuss any bookmaking activities whatsoever, or

discuss any betting activity.

from Dallas gambler EDDIE TOM GREEN that COX and LITTLE were again

operating as bookmakers and had a place "out in the county", no.

The above information was furnished to Lt. JACK REVILL,

since 3/14/63 and was of the opinion that he was out of town on a
