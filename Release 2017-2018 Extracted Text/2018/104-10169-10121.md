LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTACE SY ASKING YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.

WE UNDERSTAND

FROM CARSON AND NEITH THAT AELADLE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE SURFACED 13

THE NEAR FUTURE AND THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON MOST NATO

COUNTRIES. DO YOU INTEND TO DISCUSS THE SURFACING WITH THE GERMANS

IF AND WHEN THEY COME TO WASHINGTON.

IF NOT, WOULD YOU BE KIND

ENOUGH TO GIVE US SUFFICIENT FORWARNING OF THE IMPENDING SURFACING

INCLUSIVE OF SCENARIO AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION. TO ENABLE US TO

IT WOULD ENHANCE OUR POSITION WITH OUR I

JIF WE NERE ABLE TO ANSWER MOST OF THE QUESTIONS

WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY AELADLE EVEN IF THE

CONCERN COUNTERES AND MATTERS NOT OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO WEST

GERMANY PER SE.

EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US

FOR INSTANCE

BY HIGH LEVEL DEFECTORS WILL PROMPT DESI AND EVEN CANCUSAREUR TO

THAT: PRESS UTORANCES

REQUEST BACKGROUND AND OTHER INFORMATION FROM CHIËF OF STATION

IF POSSIBLE WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT OUR

HEADQUARTERS IN A KNOWLEDGLABLE MANNER - USAREUR SELDOM RELIES ON
