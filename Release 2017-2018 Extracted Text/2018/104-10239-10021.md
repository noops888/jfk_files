We are aware that your worc requires certain commoddties,

such as a presentable hourse, capable of making personsy who"you
recelvey feel comfortable in the atmosphere they are in.

Now, you should have analyzed your econcmic possibilities
before incurring those debts. If you had done 50 you would have
realized that these were not within jour reach (budget), for

finding @ solution to that probleia.

loan with which you can get out of your present debts.

In the future you should consult us and in particular present
