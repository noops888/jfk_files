OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN

THURSDAY, NOV. 27, 1958

STATEMUNT OF THE AMBASSADOR
OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN

. Dr. Ibrahim Anis, Ambassador of the Republic of The Sudan, today
reaffirmed his country's friendship for the United States in a statement issued on
the eve of his departure for Khartoum, scheduled originally for early this month

but delayed until tomorrow because of the formation of a new government in The

Sudan earlier thie month, : a

- Dr. Anie' statement follows: - -
“| would like to thank the American public and especially the American
press for the thoughtful consideration with which they received and appraised the
news of the recent developments in my country. Thanks to your refusal to jump to
hasty conclusions and make comparisons with events in other countries which would
not apply to The Sudan, the relations between our countries have not béen strained
as they might have been through misunderstanding and we remain today good friends.

"The Government of my country was changed because partisan strife
between political parties threatened to bring about a demoralization of our people
and a loss of confidence in our ability ae a nation to preserve the principles of free-
dom and independence to which our people are determined to adhere.

“A government of stability, including both military and civil leaders.

“acting with the approval of the spiritual leaders of our country, has asaumed respons

sibility to the people to resolve our internal problems and to maintain cordial rela-
tions with-all other countries as befitting a free and independent, democratic Repub-
lic. It has assumed the responsibility in a peaceful and orderly manner without im-
pairing the rights of dissident elements or freedom of movement of any of our cit

or visitors to our country, It has assured complete freedom of the press. It ha
pledged itself to be bound by and give full effect to the agreements into which the
Republic of The Sudan has entered since our independence nearly three years ago.

” T give thanks for all the wonderful friends I have made here,

"In doing this my country hae not been moved by external pressures
or by any feeling of unfriendliness towards other countries, On the contrary, our
Prime Minister, El Ferik Ibrahim Pasha Abboud, and his Government will work
to improve these relations on the basis of mutual respect, friendship and mutual,
interest,
“Paramount among the probleme of relations with other countries

to which our Government will_addrens itscl{ will be to give expression to the con«
viction of every Sudanese that it is of utmost importance to bring about a fair

“division of the waters of the Nile which flow from our country into Egypt and which

are of great importance to the economic development of both nations,

"Our new Government has now been recognized by virtually every
other country, including your own, Aa iny nation’s representative in the United
States since our independence I have sccn the steady growth of closer relations
and greater understanding between our countries, I am made confident by the ro-
cent evente in my country and the sympathetic response to them by your country,
that these cordial relations will endure and, indeed, can now be made even more

strong, jai

"It 1a my pleasure that my diplomatic career began and ended with
my service as Ambassador to the United States, It is a happy coincidence that

my last day in the United States is Thanksgiving Day, For me it is a day on which
It is a day on which

I congratulate all Americans for the friendship they have extended to me and to my
country,. Although 1 am returning to private life, I want them all-to know I shall

In recent weeks we have been negotiating with the Guinean Ambassador to

for his government in the US.

2 During one of these meetings at the Guinean Eutiesay about 14 May 62,
dabassaor Conte received a telephone call from Houphouet-Boigny, Pres-
ident of the Ivory Coast, in New York City. The conversation was con-
ducted in French and was’ obviowly a continuation of previous talks
on the same subject. The two men were discussing ways, means, and desire

Week of 1 Oat &
Week of 1 Oct 60

THis 18 UNEVALUATED INFORMATION,
US citizen, public relations specialist.
Source's firm specialises in publicity for foreign governments and iadustries.

During the sessions at the United Nations {week of 1 Oct 60 7 I was in
frequent touch vith Komla Agbeli Gbedemh, the Finance Minister of Ghana,
and vas eble, I believe, to get the true reaction of President Kvere Worumsh |
to Becretary Herter's remark lumping Woumeh vith the Commmists. ~~

Ghedemsh told me that Nirumsh has no personal regard whatsoever for
lamuba of the Congo, but regards him merely ag en individual tossed up by
“political tides ~ basically “an empty head", dowever, Nkrumah’s badly -
phrased remsrks vere intended to convey his rvel views vhich are, according a
to Ghedamah, that the nev countries of Africa mst develop strong national
government, or else they will revert to regional or tribal chaos. Hirumh,
therefore, teels strongly that the United Retions has given ita support to
the anti-Lummba factions, just because it does not like him nor his actions,
thereby furthering a split around the duly iostalled Prime Minister.

Nkrumh's personal reaction to Secretary Herter's remark wes one of deep burt _
end anger. In effact, he nov feels that "if ‘the US does not understand what

I em trying to do, to hel with it"! During the past year Nkrumah ves coming
out of his sulk at the US over his bed press on arrests, etc in Ghana, but this
incident has set him back again and has played into the bands of the pro-
Soviet faction in his comtry. :

Bfforts were made to have Ncrumeh appear on the Dave Gerrovay television show,
with prepared questions approved by him, to clarify his views on the position
of the neutrals, It was also arranged for hia'‘to be in one of the future
Gebates. planned by NRC, -in ich he could expound on the future role of none
African states in Africa. This vould be filmed in Accre, or anyvbere he
wished, with on .>ponent.agreeable to him. Goedemah urged both rrospects to
Hikrumeh and vas rexused flatly, through generel annoyance and personal
frustration.

As a sidelight to this matter, I also talked to the prospective Foreign
Minister of Sierra Leone (upon attaining independence) and to several Infifans.

AL expressed shock at the spparent US misunderstending of what the Africans -
feel about the importance of strong central governments in the new states.

This office Has no other info; mt'on tending to support er confirm the rung
that Romo willbe renoved in euiiy 1960 as ambassador to the US, This re-
port is considered possibly true inasmoh as reports of this mture are re~
ceived from tize to-time. Romlo is not ocnsidered a personally popular~”

figure with the Philippine government or people, or partiowlarly with the

Garcia aéministration although his personal role in convincing Garaie to

expect much higher oconcmic ald in commotion with he president's vielt can-
not be given too moh weight, It is considered that Garcia ras given adequate.
information about aid possibilities and that inflated expectations were Gareia'a
own tactics to pressure the U3. Romlo's possible replacement by Romaldes
cannot be evaluated other than sagt th fa 7 tter {s in favor with Garcia, Appo:
ment of Cuaderno as Secretary of ems doubtful as ho is over retirement
ages his relief as Central Sank doverace is Proquently rumored and Romades en~
tioned as a possible successor. Roplacement of 0 would raise speculations
about strained US-PI relations, but would probably not actually be indicative

ef a loss friendly PI attitude.

Apelt Guedenahy the Finance Wnistar of Ghana, spent the woek of

have known each other vell for 5 long tim, yet he bas never before "let als
hair down" as he bas on thia sotter. He must report to Wkrussh on Friday
rorving, 19 dug 6, regarding the quccess or failure of his alasion. Ke talked
by telephone to the Fresident 11 Aug 60 but did not tell him about the

US$5 million shortage, merely saying that there vere still a few difficrit
detatls. Nkrumh replied that Ghana vould not be put into the position of
Deseeching the US for the loans ~ he vould rather give w the whole thing and
tum elsovbere. Grecsenah is cure that if he sust report to the Prosidant that
he hes retumed vitneat the sdditional (185 million, that lmuah will
immediately have his seeretary call the foviet Ambassador.

The Finsnce Minister teld me that there had been considerable unhappiness in -
Ghana vhen Nkrussh decided to become President rether then renainiag Prins
Minister. If the disesxteat over thio mong high party aexbers had been
allowed to break out, the opposition could have exploited the ochiom and the
government would have fallen. The conflict wes contained vithin the cabinst
and at the highest party levels, but the tenseness and danger remata. (dedemah
said that Nkresah is sx egotist end some poverful people do net Iike his
selr-glorification. Gedemah commented that "Nim's days ore mubered” bub

would not enlarge fimther.

Gbedemsh is convinced that 17 the US$5 million ie not committed, “it will be
the straw to break the camel's back". He does not know why the Di was so

adament in the satter, but says that "thie is a question of saving 6 country
for the cost of a B-i7 bomber". [krumah, he assured ma, 1s leaning more ond
more avay from the Rest, and feilure to.get the loon from the US will finally |
make the President tur to the UESR for the entire amount. Yhe Soviets vill
surely agree to such sa oyportimity, eo that the US position in Ghana is
“hanging im the balance" ia the next few days. Gbedeush ie still hopeful
be will have favorable word, before be has report to Nkrumah im Acero,
the US$5 million has been granted, but he does not think this will really

Anbansailor Telli had coms down from Nev Tork for-one day the week of
12 October 1959 with a public relations nen of Olin Hathieson, but
that Telli had not gone near tha Ghanaian Zalasey, 1 esovmind that
Olin Mathtecon waa performing tho sorvicen offered by the @hmaaiaa

that because of their extecsive alunimin project in Guinea they i
wore handling no publicity for the Toure violt, nor vere they arrnug-
ing for any atate functions in Washington. Olin Yathieson had supplied
6 Fronch-opouking secretary to asaiat Anhuasesor Telli during the 7
course of legal transactions involving, I an told, the purchase of
8 very fine butlding in New York -- this would tend to discredit
Obedemub's aicumption that Telli did not have fuots for purchase of
an embassy in Washington -- but Olin Mathieson had done no public
relations vurk for Toll, Telli, I was toformed, bad requested
fupls for public relations from Preaident Toure, but had received

no reply.

5, 1 then called caveral hotels in Washington to determina vbether or not
any arrangevents bad becn sede for receptions at veich Toure would”
be host. Tha Yayflower Hotel is baodling a Toure reception for #
thousand guests on 27 October 1959, I anked who was Laodling the /
arrangements fur the reception and was reforred to a Counséllor of
- the Literian Fubassy, Tho reason for Antaseador Telli ‘s disregard
for the repeated and frantic inquiries frou the Ginnaian Ezbassy in
regard to Toure's visit immediately became apparent. in my opinion,
this deliberate snub of the Ghanaian Eabazoy 1s indicative of very
atrained relations between the governmenturof Ghana ani Guinea.
Further, Ambassador Halm of Chana has tot, yet presented his creden~
. tials, so be ia atill in Washington in en unofficial cepacity, I.
am oure that he does not intend to present his credentials until
, after Toure's visit. -In thio vay, he successfully avoids being .
_ Montiffed in any official capacity vith ‘oure’s visit.

Indian goverment and business visitors to the US have been eghast in recent
Veeks ot the anti-08 statements of the new Yedion Ambassador Muhomed ALi ¢
Supe Tuese include charges aginst US shipments of arms to Pakistan. The

On 22 Nm 59, I talkad with an important Indian infustrialist, who formerly
hold a high post in the Indian Goverment and is quite close to ‘Javaharlal

he has tacit consent to proceed.

Anbassador to desist, Nehru is alvays inclined not to interfere vith his
diplomatic representatives unless they get campletely out of line.

My informant said that he thinks the real reason for the Ambassador's actions

During @ conference in the US on Indien ‘conomic developaant on 4-5 vay 59, I
beé several opportunities to talk dnfornally with the Indian gociulict Party
loader, A Hehta. UndeF questioning, te told me that the cocialist Party :
octually coincides almost 99 percent vith the beliefo of the Lehru Covernnent,
but disdgrees on aspects of yolicy ard aduinictration. In effect, hic 19
just enother “opposition” party. £ecialion in India :icano equality of
opportunity und not too grect a concentration of vealtfr-in anyone's hinds. He
pointed out thot he is for private enterprise and used GG an éxampie the fact
that he persuaded tho Indian Coverment to get out of the fertilizer business
and permit it to be handled by private enterprise. He believes thet business
should do the jobs for which it 1s cayable and the goverment handle those it

carnot,

At the time of the Tibetan revolt, he Genanded that + Rekry cuke a firm
policy eacainst Communist China. low, be is glad that Nehru aid ret do so
because the Prine Minister knew that any such move vould jeopardize tre flight
of the Dalat Lana, vhich he bad been privately inforned was then in progress.
Mehta added that the Mbetan incident has had more effect on Indien public
opinion then any event since Independence. ‘The people at all levele are deeply
shocked. He agrees that the Indien Goverment must naintein its position of
non-alignvent officially, but the people and public servants cen continue to
have strongly anti~commmist sentiments. India io at last aroused to the danger
of commniem, vhich it wes not at the tine of the distant Hungarian repression.

He felt-that the situation in Kerala Stete was prinarily because of a “botch”
by the Congress Party. He thought thet the communists von the initial election
because the people voted in protest against the Congress Party. ‘They were not
communist sympathizers but were cerely cisgusted vith the goverment. Coczunist
success the second time was traceable to mich the same situation - seccnd rate
Congress Party cord‘Cates and ineffective policies. He is certain that the
communists cannot long remain in power in Kerala if the Cosgress Party will put
‘up g00d people. During these statenents, it was obvious that, though on antie
camurist himself, Mehta was not particulerly concerned over Kerala. He
regarded it almost as en example thut elective democracy is ectually working in

Eas been informally corsulted by two friends concerned with developments
in the Philippires. One is a US bucinescran of many years standing in
the erea ond the otier ig a Filipino who was very close to President
Magsaysay ard his edninistration,

‘Two fricrds of mire, who are in close touch with developments in the
Philippines, are most concerned about the present straized relations
betveen that courtry and the US. (re is a US businescman with many

years' experience in the country ard the other is a Filipino who was
very close to President Nagsaycoy and still hes important political

connections with the Garcia regine.

‘They have told and feirly convinced me that the rain cause for the
rift betveen the countries is the Philippine Anbasecdor to the US,
Carlos Rorulo. I could not believe this at first because it seemed

to be so completely out of character.

The story is that prior to the arrival in the US in June 1958, of
President Carles Garcia, Rormlo had been forwardirg messages that a
substantial US loan was a foregone conclusion and he could pe
arrange it, in effect by a few telephone calls. After President
Garcia reached Washington, Romlo told him tact he had the commitment
for US$100 millicn, vhich vas not truce. Atc mecting with President
Eisenhover, President Garcia mentioned the reeds of the Philippines
‘Si aiseniover replied in general terms about the US desire to be
helpful. Tais Garcie interpreted as confirmation of Romilo's
statement about the loan. Garcia cabled his goverment to this
effect ond also made statements to the press at the tine of hia

When the loan vas not forthcoming, Garcia becane bitter and ves

his beliefs by further mislecding cables from Romlo
that the US vas not living up to its agreement, that_he was working
on it, etc. It vas not until Garcia went to Jopen /Decerber 19557
and tad ano.pportunity to talk to my Pilipino friccd that he got

but their view is the long one, There will be an election in tvo

against the “flags of conventea-e” of US-owned vesaels xegiatered under

Officor ef o UB public rolotions fisn, vbich opecialigzeo in publicity for
foreign goverzzents and industries.

During o conversation with Aubasnador Ibrahim Anis, Svdaneze Anbanandor to tha US,
vo speculated upon devolepmonto supporting the recent political eoup in bio
country. I gathered hat Dr Ante had not suspected such 3 fove, although ho
otated that tha Khalil Government had become jucressingly worried about contral
of the country vith the Parliament to convene cn 2h mov 58, his Purlisment

had no cloar majority, and Abdullah Khalil feared that thero vould be resulting
chaos yhich would havo o destructive affect on tha confidence of the citizens.

Bo vao afraid that theo would be carious desoralination becouse of political

anfighting. i

Aaioc personally feclo, vithout any.confirrition as yot, that Mhalil probably
called in Gorsral Tbrehin Abboud ‘Abboud to affect an apparent coup. ‘Both ora aro Ooch

Botwcan then.

Gq nov goverment opparently bas cm imternal sotup closely paralloling tho
mk-°4 goverment's. There aro the same political divisions, but now a military
faceds has been erectcd to insure centimation of the policies already
extablishe€. “There probably will be oo change in oxtornal or internal objectives.
Anis ctated that Muhomzed Kahjub, former Foreign Minioter, had planned to place
combers of bis party in important exbascies abrosd. fhe Ambassador felt that
shin would have been a mistake, although it would have been a method of
omtonding party control .tbdor tha precast government, Career appointments will
probebly be maintained, although it ic possible that El-Mehdi vill orrange for
oor of his relatives to obtain diplomatic stations,

Anis 10 eeavinced that General Abboud ic non-political and 6 patriotic Sudancie,
who will remain in pover only until present problems ore solved. hese consist
ef internal instability dve to the bickering in political factions

(asa tho Kile water negotiations vith Egypt, which mst be detormined without
“guson losing out to Egypt. ‘hen theoo probleus are. solved, Anis feels that
Abbosd will call for elections with the hope of forming o Parliament with a
majority party. In talking to Sudanese representatives at the UI during tho

1. I hed a chat with sy acquaintance, Dr Ibrahim Anis, Budanese Ambassador #0 the
US, on 1L Roy 54, I acked him whether the Sudan would object to Egypt's
‘Duilding the high Asvan Dom on its own territory. He replied that the Sudan
could not object, but that, of course, the dam size vould then have to be limited,
a3 would the water etorage area ani resulting electric pover mie avallable by
the dam, Such & development would sot cause real trouble with the Sudan so long
ag the whole operation vas kept well within the Egyptian border,

He eaid that the Zgyptians bad aduitted that if the tvo countries were one, they
would build a series of lov dams, and then some lover version of Acvan, He felt
that this was s telling argument against Egypt's present dam position, since that
plon is the suse a8 now advocated by. the Sudan, It.refutes the Heyptian line
that the Bulan 4s-s laviess nation vntch has abrogated the treaty on use of Iiile
Water. Monetheless, the Aubassador could not conceive any.set of circumstances
vhicl vould cause @ trily serious rupture betveon the two countries, though Zeypt
tries to promte propaganda crises. He is sure. that Gamal Abdul Nasir would
never resort to military force against the Sudan and rather naively added that
he id not think that there hed been any serious Yeyptien~inspired subversion
attenpts within the Budan. His opinion 1s thet Sudazese-Zgyptian relations will
paver reach 6 crisis in fact because both coumtries wish to maintain at least

the scublance of Arab brotherhood. oan . Moe

We then discussed the Peyptian propaganda assault on the Sudan over the Nile
vaters, and the fact that the.Suian had never publicly told ita version of the
Nile dispute. finere is ‘sone conaiferatioa by the Gulanese Goverinent of fez ring

1, I have had geveral conversations with Lillian Karika, a US citizen of
Creek descent, vio worked for Creex War Relicf and became friendly as a°*
result with many important Greeks. After World War II she Learned of
the Bank of Kioa, which had been en effective organisation but had been
caught in the postwar inflation and bad become inactive, though not
liquidated. By negotiation with its private Greek overs she acquired

: 99.6% of the stock, and thereby cecame tne first US citizen to control
@ Groek bank through the instrument of a Hew York City holding company,

2. The Bank of Kios owns, free and clear, two iron mines in Greoce (one
about worked eut and not now ecorcaieal, and the other rich in both iron
and nickel), an insurance company and some real.estate in Greece, Assets
are estimated to be between US%3-5 million, The iain problem is that
the bank owes the Greek Goverment US$1 million, but. is otherwise out of debt,

3. She attempted through various metiods and negotiations to reactivate the
good mine, She had surveys mede, indicating good quality ore, and at one
time had arranged with a Gernan ecncern to supply equiyment and technical
personnel in return for royalties om ore produced, She also had dealings
with the French Bane du Nord for further financing, but learned that it
vas fronting for a Communist organization vhich wanted to participate.
These attenpts have not succeeded to date because she could not conclude
any finel arrangenents until the debt to the Greek Goverment had been
eliminated, : :

4- Though many Middle East bisinesmen would welcome a US-owned bank operating
in Groece, she has been unable to obtain any mediun or long range develojment
loans without exorbitant interest rates. (ne offer she has been hesitant
to accept cane from a Canadian fim, which offered to advance ber US$650
thousand vhieh vould settle the Goverment clain for US? million, In
return she would have had to agree to buy US$3 million worth of gold
bullion owned by the Canadian firm in Mexico, The ters vere that she
would pay about US$31.50 per gold emit , bring it to Greece and then
resell it to the Canadians at US$32,5C. She does not know the reason for
the deal except that possibly the Canadians wanted to transfer the bullion
to Isracl on a percentage arrangment of the sales price.

5. At ono stage, a major US sospany _/ took tw’ thousand tons of iron
ore for testing in the US, and when it proved out well she thought she
would have a regular supply arrangexent. It turned out, however, that the
company bas a deal vith Niarchos to cupply Greek-made steel plate for his
new Greek shipyard, vith the help of another important US technical firm

. These companies vere not interested in vorking vith her but
had other plans, She learned that they bad hopes of acquiring her mining
property through the Greek Goverment. The syndicate officials did meet

pe" orescer of a US public relations firm, vaich specializes in publicity for
foreign governments end industries.

Tas negotiated with the Sudanese for soma time about the possibility of
handling sone of their public relations work in the US.

For some tine I have made overtures to the Budanese chout conducting public
relations vork in the US for their country. They regularly stated that they
vould like such assistance but 414 not have the funds to support s proper
progrem, Early in September 1958 the tadasese Aubassador to the US,

Tbrabim Anis, received @ cable from Khartous ordering him to do Lt y-ray f
possible to inform the UB public in favor of the election of Mohammed Abmed }é
the Sudanene Foreign Minister, to the presidency of the 13th United Nations”
Generel Assembly. In thie, the Budlanese Coverment had two objectives - to
obtain this honor for Mabgoub and te call attention to the Sudan and ite position

in world affaire.

The Butan has endeavored to autntets a position of strict neutrality since
obtaining its independence and has tried to avoid any foreign e:

The main reason has been that the Sodanese Govermuont reccssited the gravity
of the task of vital doseatic ecasomic development and felt that all energies
must be spent in that direction. It. joined the Arab League primarily from the
standpoint of "brotherhood" but has still tried to renain completely neutral as
aoation, The fact that the Counci' of the Arab League decided to support
Mahgoubd in the UN vas based mostly on the fact that the Arabs considered
Charles Malik of Lebanon, the other major candidate, too pro-vest and anti-Areb
in his Views and orfentation, _

In @ meeting with Mahgoub before the UN election, he commented that he was,
puzeled by the phobia of the US people over pan-Areb nationalism, Gamal Abdul
end communism, He said that the US today equates Arab nationalism ard pride with
Nasirism, when in fact, Arab nationalism has been s fact for years before Pasir.
He added that the Sudan bag had its Se crtag' areal pista! tonrarteor een

nat Nasir had ee

als6 :
t year, es tealtaee us nat sersenniysbeasene-aieus
Soviet enbaseader to ve nore € oncrete and had alvays been given some sort of
excuse. The ambassador recently said unier a simicar attack that he wes going to
Moscow and would have something definite to say on his return.

During the period leading up to thedection, the majority of the Asian, Arab and
independent African states backed Mahgoub's candidacy because they considered bis
to be am unencumbered positon, while Mlik has become identified with the W.

In addition, thie support vas given to preva, by his election, the emergence

of the influence of small nations in the UN, as differentiated from the current
leadership of the giants. Until Sunday, 14 Sep 58, the Mahgoub group had

pledges enough to make it belicve he wol win. But at that point the US started
actively to cempaign for Malik, This move vas resented by Mabgoub. Although he

sod the US need to honor its pledge to support Malik, he believed that
US activities far excceded the commituent to Malik, The xarese, hovever;

influence then to desert the man of their choice in favor of the US selection,
They considered this directly contrary to President Bisennover's suggestion that
the Arabs should do everything povsible to solve their om problems,

Mahgoubd told me he vas sure of thirty-nine votes, with five sore probables end
some additional possibilities an hour before the olection. fhe Scand inavien
countries informed him the day before that they would not vote for Malik.
South America had divided in opinion and would vot vote as a bloc. Of these,
Mahgoud hed six pledges of support but in the final count, he ended without a
single voto from Latin Americas as a result of vhat he called “threato" from
the US. The Ghana delegate felt. that he had a higher duty than to support

tho UX, as a menber of the Conmonvealth, in voting for Mlik, Liboria had

~ been the first nation in Africa to back the Kieenhover Doctrine and to support

the US landings in Lebanon, but it too felt that a neutrel uoderatar should be
elocted, :

‘The Sudarese were upset by the anti-Mahgoub mmors, which they are convinced
vere fostered by the US, that the Sudan is pro-communist and pro-Arab. These
tories were common in fe UN in the final days before the vote and went so far
ao to say that Mahgoub himsel? was @ pro-Nasir stooge, despite his record.

Fhe Sudanose do not consider themselves "neutral on the side of the USSR", and
in fact bove an effective anti-commnist liv. They feel that their country's
reputation was blackened unjustly by these rumors and the resulting election,
Tt may nov be hard to combat Soviet propaganda opportunities in the Sudan,

such ag claims that the US opposed a black Moelem in favor of a white Christian
and that the USSR backed the Sudan vhile the US supported the other side to
4ts ovn national interest. Mahgoub fears that it will be bard for the Sudanese
people to resist such propaganda in their disappointment at the outcome of the
election, He is certain that the Sudanese papers will be full of Soviet-inatigated .

Mabgoud believes that: the Arab nations will be most irritated at Malik's elect; oa :
Dut that it will take some time to determine actual effects. He asked me whe’ t

Mahgoub wes certain that General Shehab did not endorse Malik, as was repotted

in the US press. Sheheb alvays issues public statements as written cambmiques, —
which did not occur in this instance, A US correspondent had telephoned Shehab
for a story and in conversation Shehab had casually mentioned that Malik wes a
Lebdaness ani he wished him well. ‘The ultimate story did aot appear in the a
Lebanese press because Shehabd himself controls cen vorship in that country,

In fact, the Lebanese press endorsed Mahgoub even more than did the Sudanese ©

papers. H

gbould be supported by the Areb-states. This did not come about and my impression

, but nov fear that its carefully fostered

Mahgoud told me that he now plans to stay through the early part of tha UN

session and thep will do what be can to keep Sudan public opinion on an even
keel. He added that there might be another chance for him to te elected
President of the Assexbiy.

foreign govermments ond industries.

4. Whea Kwame Nkmmab, Primo Minister of Ghana, planned to visit the US
(July-August 1958), I vas interested to see that Kole Agbeli Goodemah was not
dneluded in the party. Be waa left at home to “tend the store”. fowever, on
@rrival in Washington, Nkrwash foud that the arrangements for US financial
assistance were not so far advanced #3 he hed thought and requested that Gbedemah
fly over to attend meatings as Minister of Finance for Ghana,

2. I have koovn Gbedemsh for sowe time and understend that he is really the "right
““hand”-or Iikrumah. The two man are completely differext types vho need ond
complemcnt each other, There is no real love lost between them but both have a
great respect for the other, The other ministers dislike Gbedemah for his
influence over the Prime Minister. Ghedemah admitted to m2 that he can push
matters just so far in the other ministries end then must be extremely careful
not to Lave his colleagues think he ie trying to intrude in their spheres of
influence. Hikrwumah, too, is conustious of this jealousy and tries to conceal the
extent of the Finance Minister's importance. It 1a very.comeon for Hkrumah to
Aiecusc a matter with a Hinistérand then turn to Gbedemah for bis advice as weil,
At the conclusion of the visit to Washington, Mkrumsh asked Coedemah to
accompeny him far the rest of the trip, but the minister refused, eaying that
Nerumab could do the hand shaking, but he thought it would be a waste of time

would dere to refuse a Mcrumah request.

3. Gbedenah is an interesting personality, Be is very wi-Africen and is almost an
amalgam of Africa, the US ani Europe. He is truly an imtellect by African or
almost any standards, with wide ranging interests in many fields. ‘he Minister
is extrenely vell-resi, spending tvo to four hours nightly with a book. Eo .
Scoops up material of all kinds vherwver he goes ani his powers ef retention are |
excellent. His preferences are for information of a practicsl rather than
‘theoretical nature, and his thinking tends to be tovards the possible rather

will not be a unffixd nation initially, but ectually three political units of
the West, South and North, with a loose single goverment structure on tep. The
central government will be weak and ineffective for sone time for lack of
experienced personnel and because of area rivalries. However, because of
Rigeria's future potential, Gbedemah already makes a point of going out of his
way to cultivate Bigerians,
