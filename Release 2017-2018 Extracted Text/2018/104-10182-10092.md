Action: Paragraphs 1 and 8, Postar ne Use

1. In response to the Station's request contained in
reference for information on Mitchell Livingston WER-SELL, IIT,
this is to provide the Station with sone pertinent personal data
on him, and to recommend that the Station, i.e., Theodore R, KETTNE: °
avoid contact with him in operational matters but, to the extent
securely possible, monitor his activities in the area.

: 2. WER-BELL, born on 8 March 1918 in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, was married in 1942 to Ji Idegarde Elizabeth
HEMMERICH, and has six children. He was an Army first lieutenant
when recruited by KUTWIN, ith which service he saw duty with some
distinction in the China Theater during the second half of 1945,

i 3. In 1953 he: established his own business, Mitchell werbell
Public Relations and Advertising Company, in Atlanta, Ceorgia,
which went out of business in 1959, due to insolvency caused
priadrily by his injudicious and unorthodox trade practices.

@ Subject is well-known to KUBARK, whose officers have
categorized him variously as unscrupGlous, a "whealer-dealer",
and a promoter of grandiose schemes; as a man who lives beyond
his means; and as a high-pressure advertising and promotion

man,

‘Ss In the summer of 1959 Subject offered his services to
KUBARK, claiming knowledge of Cuban and Uosinican affairs.
Although a POA was granted on 4 August 1959 for his use as a
source of information on revolutionary activities in the
Caribbean area, it evolved that the information he provided was
of little value, It was further judged that Subject wished to

use KU3ARK funds to promote his personal interests and
consequently, he was terminated in Uctober of 1959.

6. «ith regard to Subject's assertions as reported in
reference, we wish to corment that:

a. Although we cannot confirm gy controvert nis
status as vice-president of FINA, in Aprid cf 1963 he allowed
\to ODENVY at Atianta that he was presidéat of Communications
International, Inc. GUENVY pad cdhtacted Subject to determine H
his possible connection with Dr. Elmer Henry LOUGHLIx, who
has recently been indited as an unregistered agent of the
Haitian Government.

b. while his claim of past KUTWIN service is true,
_the degree of his friendship with that service's well-known
director remains open to speculation, ior there are no
indications that the two were even acquainted.

c. The nature and extent of his relationship with
many important Central American officials is scored by an
episode which occurred in August-September 1962, when he tried
to secure the recognition by several Central Anerican countries
of a Cuban government in exile. In this undortaking, for
example, he offered a Nicaraguan government spokesman
$100,000 to secure that country's recognition. And, in
October of 1962,he reportedly tried, through an intermediary,
to purchase used military aircraft in PBPRIME ostensibly for }
use in the Dominican Republic to train Latin American pilots
for a thrust against Cuba. /Yn this October report, Subject
is cited as being a forner public relations representative
here tor the Trujillo regincy?

7, Further to the above, in Cctober of 1962 Subject was
being investigated vy OvENVY For his possible involvosent in
1959 in the shipping of arms tu Ecuador.

8. ‘The above salient features as to Subject's background,
should be sufficient to discourage any operational use o
subject, and to indicate the need for caution on Ke TIniK's
part should he have any further contact with hin. At the sane
tine, deadquarters considers that information on Subject'«
local activities and contacts, as could affect OOYOKc interests,
should be reported as such becones known to the Station.
