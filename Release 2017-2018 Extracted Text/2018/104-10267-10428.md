MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: "American Defectors to the USSR"

• The attached material was part of a soft file entitl

American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR.

(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components

until ca. 1963.

The compilations were derived from a varlety

of sources, and contain both classifled and overt data,

the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,

incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with

a copy of this memorandum,

It is suggested that any dissemination of this data should

be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in

view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that

disseminations have already been made through the US Defector

Machine Program.
