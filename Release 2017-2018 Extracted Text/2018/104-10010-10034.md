Jim, herewith is

copy of Congressman Fords re-

hash of the Oswald case. Stiles sat with him during much of the

Hearings period.

I had this from Walter Pforzheimer for an advanced look, 1t

must be returned to him without fail Friday morning.

The first chapter, "The Commission Gets its First Shock", centers

on the allegation that

Oswald was an FBI agent. Neither the chapter

nor the rest of the book sustain the cargo.

I'm afraid however that

the pesentation if it is quoted out of context could be utilized

by the Lefties tux (Mark lane, et al) to continue their pxa campaign.

Perhaps you will want to call this matter to Sam's attention.

I do not regard any of the treatment of CIA--which is minimal--

to be objectionable. (However, I haven't read evry page.)
