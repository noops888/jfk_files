and in the process, you obviously work up
some people who are able to do this kind of work, which is
quite different from the normal life style of most of us.

Mr. Harvey had been a very venturesome officer in the
past. He was responsible for the Berlin tunnel.. And he was
sent down to take this job. And he assumed as part of it the
capability of -- he was given by Mr. Bissel this chore of
earrying on this particular operation as well.

Mr. Schwarz. Had he been the person who had, in
connection with the abortive effort to kill Mr. Lmumba,

hired an agent for that purpose?

Mr. Colby. I have forgotten whether hehired him. He t(B)

references that an additional assignment was to look into the

possible assassination of Mr. Lmumba. The evidence is

that he went down to what is now Kinshasa, Elizabethvi in
1960, stayed there a few weeks, and left in October, I

believe. And then Mr. Lmumba was killed thereafter in a totally
separate set of circumstances in which we had nothing te do. |
There is some indication that a CIA officer who was asked

to have something to do with this particular job said he did H

not want to do it.

Also, I believed that there was a undue degree of compart>

mentation of that staff, that it needed more interchange with

our other divisions. We debated this and discussed it and T
set as my time limit for this discussion the end of December
because there were some very substantial retirement benefits
that people would loose if they stayed after that point. Then

unfortunately the Seymour Hirsh article of December 22nd came

to our attention before it was actually publishes

Chinese Communists subsequently blamed the Chinese Nationalis

had fled to Taiwan. We had nothing to do with that incident

Chairman Church, Senator Hart.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with
ZR Rifle, I think you testified or your associate said this was

a multi-purpose operation

development of the capability of what euphemistically is called
executive action.

In your professional judgment, and with your history of
your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you

a major operation, a major intelligence gathering operation Gy

about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of

something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,
I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?

Does it not suggest to you that AEE) g ' Cosas, was in A{@)
fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination
operation with unlimited, non-voucher financial capability?

Mr. Colby. No, not that it is purely a cover.

In the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour
in Berlin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was

one of our major successful intelligence operations.

Mr. Harvey was a very colorful figure who had his lifestyle,

| which is different than some others, but he had been very

as well as this other activity.
Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second
one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been
discussing. It was not to be put on the record although to be
done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,

but to say that as only a cover I think is 4

“igi

probably an unwarranted conclusion.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding |

of $7,500 to $10,000?

Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of
an operation.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too

Little.

Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is

largely a staff operation. In other words, you use your own

Staff officers, You may hire an agent or something, but I don

think you can draw much conclusion from the actual number on

the figure one way or the other.

“ @his might not have been the only such project. You knew,

an assassination project would cost you more money than that,
too.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Absolutely.

Mr. Colby. I find it hard to say that that is the only

uation

where additional money would be put into either of those kinds
