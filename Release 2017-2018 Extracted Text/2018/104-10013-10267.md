CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECTS: LIROBBIN-1 and -2 2.) 665

| DATE OF MEETING: 14 December 1967

1, LIROBBIN-2 called on 13 December and asked to see me. I
conseuently met her and LIROBBIN-1 at their apartment from 1035-1140
on 14 December, The next meeting will be arranged by telephone.

2. Pearl GONZALEZ. It turned out that the number one topic
Subjects wit wished to discuss was Pearl GONZALEZ, who recently
interviewed New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and

+4 reported the interview in a front-page article in the 11 December
edition of The NEWS. In the arbitle, which is attached, Pearl
quoted GARRISON as attacking the CIA as the U.S.'s "fascist alter
ego.” LIROBBIN-1 said that the article was evidently only a
prelude to a major campaign against CIA and the Warren Commission
involving Pearl, District Attorney GARRISON, and RAMPARTS magazine.
LIROBBIN-1 said that Pearl had only returned to Mexico about a week
ago and she wasn't saying too much about the whole business, but

that from talking with her he had learned the following facts

2)

and fragments:
Vs (a) That Pearl is presently collaborating with RAMPARTS
vagazine on the Joel David KAPLAN case. LIROBBIN-1 said he was

_S-

certain that Pearl's relationship. with RAMPARTS began in May of

on

4 this year when RAMPARTS: reporter John RAMSEY (pen name of John

a RAYMOND) waw in Mexico to cover the KAPLAN case. LIROBBIN-1

my said that Pearl and RAMSEY were quite friendly when RAMSEY was, iy NEW?

here and recalled that Pearl had done a series of articles’ “on the

COPIES MADE

for FOIA Review on vec



KAPLAN case after RAMSEY's sudden and involuntary departure from
Mexico. In these articles Pearl repeatedly cited the possibility
that the CIA might well be involved in the KAPLAN case because of
KAPLAN's uncle's connection”the Agency (ise. the KAPLAN Fund).
(There was considerable correspondence with Headquarters on RAMSEY's
visit. LIROBBIN-1's previous reporting on RAMSEY, who according
to Pearl has since been fired by RAMPARTS$ is contained in a
Memorandum for the ‘Record dated 3 May 1967.)

(>) "hat RAMPARTS arranged Pearl's interview with GARRISON
ané paid for her trip to New Orleans, ‘The reason for this is
that RAMPARTS is trying to put together evidence that the KAPLAN
case is directly connected with the assassination of President
Kennedy. Although Pearl was not at all clear about this, one
element in RAMPARTS theory is evidently that KAPLAN was the person
who tipped off Castro on the timing of the Bay of Pigs invasion,
Because of this, RAMPARTS theory runs, Senator Robert Kennedy has
been exerting (presumably a#&é* either directly or through the
U.S. Government--and ultimately the U.S. Embassy in Mexico) pressure
on the Mexican Government to keep KAPLAN imprisoned.

(c) That RAMPARTS has about six staff reporters working on
the story and that one of these reporters sat in on Pearl's
interview of GARRISON{

(d) That GARRISON was so impressed by Pearl that he asked
her to join his staff (which she declined to do).

(e) That Pearl went on to New York from New Orleans and
talked to a famous trial lawyer there about the KAPLAN case.

3. The LIROBBINS' opinion of Pearl is somewhat ambivalent.

On the one hand, they consider her a friend and enjoy her company.
On the other, however, they recognize that she is a very impression-
able, left-leaning, and irresponsible person and are concerned
about the harm she is doing to her own government. While I am
certain they would not want to be responsible for the U.S. Government
taking any action against Pearl--such as trying to have her thrown
out of Mexico--they nevertheless both suggested that the U.S.
Embassy at least protest to Publicaciones Herrerias about her
provocative stories appearing on the front page of The NWS.
LIROBBIN-1 added that he understood that. either Romulo O'Farrill
Sr. or Jr. had considered Peqrl's GARRISON article to be too
muckrakish to print in NOVEDADES/ Yet he permitted it to appear
on the front page of The NEWS.

4s SARATOV and SYCHEV. Subjects said they had seen SARATOV
and SYCHEV together at the Press Glub ‘twice in the past two weeks.
SYCHEV was introducing SARATOV around on both occasions and
introduced him to Subjects on the first. Subjects chatted with
SARATOV both times and found him very friendly and outgoing, but
much less aggressive than SYCHEV. Subjects explained that SYCHEV
is "outgoing" to the point that he will zero in on someone he has
just been introduced to and ask the person so many questions as
to literally debrief him on his whole life. SARATOV's English
grammar and American accent, according to Subjects, are a little
better than SYCHEV's, although SYCHEV uses more American slang
and colloquialisms than SARATOV. SARATOV asked Subjects to call
him "Ed."

5. Subjects said they were very impressed by SARATOV's seemingly



genuine liking for the United States. While he said nothing about
having attended Yale, he spoke enthusiastically of his tour in
Washington, of how much he and his wife had liked it there, and of
how they had hated to leave. In fact, his wife, he said, had come
to like the U.S. so much and become so used to the modern conveniences
of life in the United States, that she was having a hard time
adjusting to Mexico. SARATOV went on to say that he had traveled
all over the United States. When one of Subjects asked him if

he had been in Chicago, he replied that he had and he thought it
was a great city. Had he been in San Francisco, someone asked.
Oh, Sqn Francisco, he answered--he loved San Francisco and wokld
love to live there, New Orleans? Yes, he had had the est time
of his life in New Orleans and thought it was a great place.
Shortly thereafter, someone asked a question about Moscow (if it
had changed much in the last ten years or something similar).

In sharp contrast to his enthusiatic commnts onthe United States,
SARATOV brushed off the question by replying uninterestedly that
he hadn't been back to Moscow for two and a half years and in
the last ten years really hadn't seen much of Moscow at all.
Subjects noted that SARATOV made only one other reference to the
USSR in the two times they talked with him (see next paragraph)
and that he avoided political topics completely.

6. SARAPOV mentioned that he had specialized in languages in
school andhad worked as a guide in the USSR "for Americans and
Latin Americans," because "those two languages" were his "specialty."
(Since Subjects spoke W&SBWRATO¥ with SARATOV in English, they
have not heard him speak Spanish.)



7. Subjects said that Kathy MANJARREZ (P-12800) had mentioned
to them that SARATOV had come into the Press Club\alone on the
evening of (12 December,

8. PRIKHODKO. Sub jects had PRIKHODKO to dinner with a small

crowd of other guests on the evening of Monday,\11 December}
i PRIKHODKO didn't arrive until 2130 or 2200 and explained that he
had had to attend a "reception”™ (no mention of where) beforehand.
Although LIROBBIN-2 specifically asked him to bring his wife, he
as usual, showed up without her. When LIROBBIN-2 asked where his

wife was, he smiled blandly and said, "She's at home. She likes it
there." The only guest PRIKHODKO showed any particular interest in

was a Brit by the name of. Denny JACOBSON. JACOBSON, according to
————

|
! ' LIROBBIN-2,came to Mexico about 6=8 months ago and works for IBM here.
| LIROBBIN-2 said that JACOBSON is a friend of Jose (Pepe) “ncuo,
and like ANGULO, is a homosexual, Subjects said that PRIKHODKO

i

|

ne spent a good hour and a half or more talking with JACOBSON off
HF to one side, After PRIKHODKO left (about 0130), JACOBSON told
LIROBBIN-1 that PRIKHODKO had asked him to demonstrate some IBM
H . machines for him. JACOBSON implied to LIROBBIN-1 that he had

| agreed to demonstrate the machines. (The 1967-68 Anglo-American

‘ 9- Subjects also saw PRIKHODKO on two other occasions since -

I last talked with them:
earl GONZALEZ's home on Thanksgiving evening

ibe. 2
af ‘
6] ‘(23 November), As she did last year,'Pearl/had a big’ Thanksgiving

4 . dinner to which she invited PRIKHODKO, the LIROBBINS, and a number
i of people from the Bress Club. Subjects said the evening was

uneventful.

(b) At Benno LIEBERMANN's Folkloric Association on the

evening of 9 December. This was Russian (or Ukrainian) night at

the Association and PRIKHODKO was there with various members of

the Ukrainian Ice Ballet troupe. Subjects recalled that about a year
ago LIEBERMANN had tried to get Soviet Embassy cooperation for

a Russian night, but had always been put off (see CR report of

i - "9 Jan 1967). Subjects said they didn't know how LIEBERMANN and

I! the Soviets had finally managed to get together.

| : 10. Although not previously reported, LIROBBIN-1 told me in

| November that he and LIROBBIN-2 had attended the celebration of
the October Revolution at ‘the Soviet Embassy on'7 November. i

LIROBBIN-1 had told me that nothing of any special interest had :

occurred and LIROBBIN-2 onfirmed this on 14 December,

ll. I told Subjects to take advantage of any opportunities
te to become friendly with SYCHEV and especially SARATOV, since it
looks as though they may be seeing these two Soviets at the Press

7 Club from time to time. I specifically suggested that they invite
SYCHEV and SARATOV the next time they invite PRIKHODKO to a party.
I told them that while they obviously could not drop PRIKHODKO,

we were nonetheless mre interested in SYCHEV and SARATOV and
would like to have them at least be on good terms with either

or both of these Soviets when the time came for PRIKHODKO to leave
Mexico (which Mrs. PRIKHODKO has said they will do sometime in
1968).
