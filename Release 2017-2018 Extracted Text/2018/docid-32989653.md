A briefing for Senators Church and Tower has been provided
covering warrantless electronic surveillances { surreptitious entry for
recovery of eryptogranhic material, teletype coverage requested by the
National Security Agency and electronic penctration of coxnwnications
equipment requested by the National Security Agency. The White House
asked that agencies of the intelligence coumaunity not éSsgond to any
requests from the SSC covering these matiers until the briefing had been
given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowledge of these matters
to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information
throughout the &3C staff. In view of this, it is recouamended that the
enclosed iasterial not be rade available to the SSC staff until it ig dis-
cussed with the \:hite House. I further urge that it be made clear to the
White House that if this material is to be made available to the SSC that
access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower,
and $5C €tatf Director William iiiller only.

On September 17, 1975, Mary Wagner, an attorney in the office a
of the Deputy Attorney General, accompanied by Bruce Baird, an attorney SS
recently appointed to the Deputy's office, met with me in my office and NY
advised that they have been assigned the responsibility of drafting guidelines WS
for the Attorney: General's approval concerning legal representation of ~
Department employees. She explained that they view the problem of 9
legal advice to employees as larger than the request made by the FBI NS
concerning Bureau employees, and that the guidelines would address the
larger problem. She asked for my suggestions concerning the proposed a
guidelines. ZI

. i

I told Miss Wagner that in the beginning of the inquiries received
from the Senate and House Select Committees, we had been advised by the
Department that a conflict of interest would prohibit Department attorneys, &
including lawyers in the FBI, from providing - legal representation individuallyg
to the employees of the Fi in matters relating to the Senate and House o-
inquiries. As a consequence we have been advising our employees of the
procedures involved in Congressional committee interviews: and appearances
for testimony; the limitations imposed on the employees in regard to sensitive
areas of testimony which might require special approval; their right to
counsel and of the limitation imposed on us that personal counsel would have
to be privately employed. {told Miss Wagner that my reading of the
Attorney General's memorandum for the Director dated September 12, 1975,
was that the Attorney General intended to make personal legal advice available
to employees requesting it and that we would Like for the guidelines to be
written broadly enough for employees to receive effective assistance of legal

counsel. v on £2. I]b3 9s=

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

I suggested to her that the Attorney General might approve the
appointment of a special counsel within the Department whose responsibilities
would be somewhat similar to those imposed on the Special Counsel for
| Intelligence Coordination in that he would be relieved of other Department
responsibilities and his allegiance would be only to discharging the obligations
of personal counsel when requested by an employee. I suggested that such
special designation would permit the Department lawyer so assigned to
avoid the conflict of interest problem and at the same time it would impose
on him the obligations of the attorney-client privilege.

Miss Wagner commented that she understood that in some cases
handled by the Civil Division of the Department, Government attorneys
represent employees in civil suits, but require that the employee waive
the attorney-client privilege to the extent that should the Government employee
become aware of information that should be communicated to another division
of the Department, the attorney would furnish such information to the other
division. If the attorney learned of criminal conduct on the part of the
employee, he would not be prohibited by the attorney-client privilege from
making such conduct known to the Department.

T told Miss Wagner that an essential element of the relationship
between the special counsel for furnishing advice to employees would be
that the attorney-client privilege would apply and it would not be possible
for such a waiver to be required in exchange for providing legal advice.
She agreed.

I suggested to Miss Wagner that the Department special counsel
could be available for consultation concerning such matters as appearances
before Congressional committees and for such preliminary advice as would be
useful to employees called to testify. At the point where the special counsel
determined that the employee required more in-depth legal assistance in order
to protect his legal rights, the special counsel could recommend to the
Deputy Attorney General that the employee should be afforded an opportunity
to have private counsel whose fees would be paid by the Department of
Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams i
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

In regard to the question of security clearance for such outside
counsel and the possibility that an employee might seek to employ an
attorney whose background would suggest that he would not be approved
for security clearance; I told Miss Wagner that the provision of private
counsel to an employee would be done in the discretion of the Department
and that. 2 reasonable limitation could well be imposed by the Department
as to those attorneys in private practice who would be eligible for appoint- .
ment to represent individual employees. Such limitation would permit
the Department and the employee to agree upon an attorney who hiaial be
qualified for security clearance.

Miss Wagner inquired as to when the Department's responsibility
for furnishing legal counsel to an employee should terminate. I told her
that an. appropriate time would be when the Department advised the
employee that a decision had been made to prosecute the employee. Up
to that point the inquiries would have been directed toward the determination
of the circumstances and that the employer-employee relationship would
justify protecting the legal rights of the employee, but at the point at
which the Government determines and so advises the employee that the
employee would be prosecuted, the Government and the employee would
become adversaries.

We discussed the provision in Federal law for the appointment of
counsel for Federal defendants in cases where the defendant is indigent.
I suggested that they consider the possibility that even in those cases
where an employee is to be prosecuted, the Department consider the
possibility of employing existing law to provide counsel to employees
who may become defendants in criminal cases.

As to the scope of the representation of the employee, I told
Miss Wagner that the initial need is for legal advice in situations where
an employee is called for au interview or testimony by Members,
committees, subcommittees, or other units of the Congress. However, I
explained that due to the publicity of the Congressional inquiries, others may
well be interested in pursuing independent inquiries concerning the same
matters or other matters and that employees may well request legal
advice when they are callec for interview or testimony by the Criminal

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

Division of the Department, the Civil Rights Division of the Department,

or other Federal Government entities including Federal Grand Juries.
Further, state and local prosecutors and grand juries may seek to inquire
concerning matters within their jurisdiction arising out of the employee's
Federal activities and the employee would require the assistance of counsel.
Therefore, Iasked Miss Wagner to include in the guidelines a provision
that legal counsel would be available through the Department for employees
in all circumstances where the employee is being questioned concerning
matters arising out of his employment in the FBI.

I told Miss Wagner that the concluding paragraph in the Attorney
General’s memorandum for the Director indicated the possibility that a
determination would be made in some cases that the employee's activities
were beyond the scope of his duties and in such cases legal counsel would
not be provided. I told her that such a determination would be critical
and the policy followed in making such decisions would color the entire
program of providing legal assistance to employees. Therefore, I
requested Miss Wagner to address the question of scope of duties in the
guidelines by expressing a presumption that the employee's activities
were within the scope cf his duties and that such presumption would be
overcome only by a showing of facts clearly indicating to the contrary,
and that such determination would be made at least by the Deputy Attorney
General himself.

TFtold Miss Wagner that this matter was most urgent and that the
Special Agents of the FEI throughout the field are anxiously awaiting the
announcement of the Attorney General's policy in regard to availability
of legal advice to employees concerning matters arising out of their
employment. She advised me that wo. k would begin immediately and that
she would be in touch with me concerning its progress, and to discuss
the guidelines as they are developed.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

i: On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike
Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He
said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day
weekend and asked whether I would be available for
interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. ZI told him I would.
Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed
to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,
August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between
3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in
amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked
during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge
in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to
December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before
that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta
(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau
career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps
maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware.of certain taps placed and
removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there
were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told
him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and
that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information
..which might answer his questions...I told him that every-
thing that was done was properly recorded, that the
records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs
from the record, he should rely on the record to determine
what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to
your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed

outside your agency.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King
coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. told
him I did not recall, but that in any case it was
approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in
which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He
asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I
do not now recall whether I was told why they were
discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the
reason. He asked whether we had a bug oh King as opposed
to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were
possible there were taps and ‘bugs placed and maintained
without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible
because of the size of the office and the relationship
I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was
done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any
Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled
none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent
King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere
with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a
banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director
William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him
Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional
conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the
Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan
and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met
with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,
that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,
but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked
the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a
meeting took place it was in the nature of a social

call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a
public: relations~type of meeting. He asked whether there
was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding
any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked
whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta
and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry
made by the Bureau into the handling of the King
investigation either through the Inspection Staff or
otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked
whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King
investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I
told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not
recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.
I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was
still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had
supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor
Charles Harding.

U, S,. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J, CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 20, 1975, Mir. Loch Johnson of the Senate
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect
to Intelligence Activities (SSC) staff interviewed me in ny
office, Room 4821, JEH Building, concerning my knowledge of,
and participation in, the so-called "Huston Plan."

Mr. Johnson did not place me under oath or advise me
of my rights.

life asked about my background which I provided y including
the fact that I have been a Special Agent of the FBI since
August 7, 1950,

With regard to the extent of my participation in the
Huston Plan, I advised Mr. Johnson that I was selected by former
Assistant Director Willian C, Sullivan to act as the liaison
officer for the plan, probably because of my experience in the
FBI Domestic Liaison Section and my extensive Liaison contacts
through my participation in the various United States Intelligence
Board (USIB) Committees. My duties with regard to the Huston Plan
were to insure that appropriate notification of meetings was made
and that the various papers prepared as the result of meetings
held were delivered to the proper individuals in the other agencies
participating in the plan, Some of the papers were delivered
personally by me, others were sent by courier.

I advised Mr. Johnson that I was generally aware of
the contents of the papers prepared through my attendance at the
meetings of the working group and discussions with participating
personnel; however, I porsonally made no input nor did I participate
in the preparation of the workpapers or the finished product.

U. S, SENATE SELECT COMMITTER
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECTAL AGENT (5A)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Me. Johnson asked if I had met Tom Charles Huston
prior to the initial meeting of the Huston Plan working group.
I advised hin that I had never heard of Huston prior to the
mentioning of his name by VW. C. Sullivan at the initial uecting
of FBI personnel involved in the Huston Plan, which meeting
occurred early in June, 1970, and had never seen him until the
first meeting of the working group held at CIA Headquarters,
Langley, Virginia, shortly thereafter.

Me, Johnson asked about the initial meeting of FBI
personnel concerning the Huston Plan. i told him it was held
in Me. Sullivan's conference room in the Federal Triangle
Building and that as best as I could recall it was attended by
Mr, Sullivan and the branch Inspectors of the Intelligence
Division as well as the Section Chiefs, Sullivan told us of

' the plan and as I recall indicated this was a golden opportunity

to regain the coverage afforded by techniques, which had been
denied us for the most part, since 1967, [ told him that in ny
view Sullivan was going to mike this one last effort to regain
the coverage and if this effort failed was prepared to retire.

Me. Johnson asked if former Inspector T. J, Smith was
at this meeting. I told him I could not recall,

The initial meeting of the Ad Hoc group at CIA was
discussed and I advised him that, as I vecalled, at that meeting
it was decided that cach participating agency would submit a
paper listing the restraints on theiv particular agency which
were hampering them in doing their job. f pointed out that the
FBI subnitted an extensive list of vestraints and that this paper
was circulated to the other participating agencies without being
Cleared through Mr. Hoover.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J, CASSIDY BY SSC START MEMBER

Me. Johnson asked if I was aware of who was the
instigator of the Huston Plan, If told hin I had no direct
knowledge put would suspect it was W. C, Sullivan, Huston, or
possibly formor Assistant Attorney General Robort Meardian;
however, the answer to his question would have to be obtained
pharm individuals or such records as he may be able to

OCB EC,

He asked my impression of Tom Charles Huston. I told
him I felt Tuston was a very bright young man who saw this plan
aS an opportunity to become the Henry Kissinger of domestic
security and thereby enhance himself and his political career,

Mc. Johnson stated that bis investigation had developed
that Sullivan at the outset of the plan appeared to want to push
through the plan; however, he scened to take a direct turnabout
and began to advise Hr. Hoover against adopting some of the
proposals being made by the vavious participating agencics. He
said it was his improssion that this turnabout oceurred at the
tine Sullivan was promoted to Number Three Man in the Bureau.

He asked if I could shed any light on this turn of events.

I told Mr. Johnson that I could not speak for Sullivan
and could only give him my impression of what occurred, that being
at the outset of the pian Sullivan truly felt this was a golden
opportunity to get the coverage back, and decided to lay his job
on the line to accomplish this. When he was moved up to the
Number Three job, I felt he saw the opportunity te someday become
the Director of the FBI. Furthor, as the drafts of the plan were
being written, Sullivan realized that sooner or later Mr. Hoover
would see them and at that time realize that Sullivan had dissem-
inated to the intelligence commmity ali of the restraints
Mr. Hoover had imposed on the FBI.

Sullivan then tried to have the other agencies
Listed as the agenejéswhich submitted the restraints. Having
accomplished this, he was then in a position to advise Hr. Hoover
that this or that was not wise or necestary. When the final
voport was prepared, the FBI then footnoted most of the recon
nendations as opposing then,

Me, Johnson said he had boen advised by My. Helms and
Adniral Gaylor that the final draft which they reviewed prior to
going to te, Hoover's office to sign it did not contain the
footnotes and that they were not aware that the FBI was objecting
to the recommendations until they saw the final vergion of the
report in Hr. Hoover's office,

i told him that I cannot specifically recall what was_
ain the final draft; hovever, I wan aware that all of tho working
croup was ayare of the FBI position as it was so stated at the
necting in which the draft was hammercd out. I told hin I
specifically recalled this as it had put tr. Sullivan in a most
enbarrassing position, At one point when asked why 2 change was
to be made or why the FBI was going to object, Sullivan responded
with words to the effect that because lie. Hoover raid so.

Ur. Johnson asked why covert mil coverage was listed
ag a restraint as CIA was engaged in such coverage in 1970. I
told him I was not in a position to discuss CIA operations with
hin, He aigso asked about the removal of restrictions or use of
purreptitious entries to obtain cryptographic materials. I told
him I wag not free to discuss such activity vith hin,

In respect to Items 14 and 15, we axe delivering

"@ document dated December 17,°1964.. As indicated on page 2

of this document, it was epproved for Mr. Sullivan by

someone whose initials appear to the right of "HCS/."

Although we cannot say with absolute certainty vho. thet person
might have been, the initiale appear to be those of former

FBI Special Agent (8A) Daniel J. Brennan, Foxmer SA &. R.
Cleyton approved the communication for Mr. Tolson., Notations .
on page 2 indicate that Mr. Belmont a it and also
advised FBI Director Hopver of ite contents on December 18,
presumably 1964. No written approval by Mr. Hoover ig noted.

to Item 21, we are delivering e document

. ; In respect
dated August 24, 1967, We have previously furnished the
- $96, by memorendum dated June 24, 1975, and subtitled "Request

Perteining to.Rlectroni¢ Surveillance," an excised ‘copy of

the August. 24, 1967, document. The copy which is now being
delivered conteina certein adm{nistrative date which had been
excised on previous delivery. However, those excisions
remaining relete to the substance of the memorendum and vere
made to protest the identity of a representative of a friendly
foreign intelligence service, the name of that service and

the name of the country fnvolved. -

- With respect to the excisions in meterials being

delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason

for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic survelliances of King. In some
eases, it can be ascertained precisely what information in
FBI £4les come from electronic surveillances of Dr. King;
however, there exist areas where documentation of the
informetion fs not precise and no accurate determination can
be made. Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions
of the materiel being furnished do not contain information
developed as a result of electronic surveillances of King.

The enclosed article, captioned as above, is the
one we have been preparing in line with approval of our
recommendation to disseminate it on a select basis at a
very high level to show current communist activities in
relation to the Negro movement. It incorporates up-to-date ~ 1
material just received from our New York Office relating 1
to the recent meeting of the Communist Party's National
Executive Committee. Discussion of racial matters was a
primary topic at the week-long meeting. 4 f

The enclosed article is a factual, documented

;| analysis of the over-all current situation. We believe :
t¢that it would be of interest not only to the Attorney General fl
but also to Mr. O'Donnell, at the White House; Mr. McGone, at
the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Department 7

of States; as well as to Mr. McNamara and the three Armed Forces

if the article as prepared is approved, we propose to dis-

Enclosed is a paper, captioned as above, which depicts the communist
influence in the Negro movement with emphasis on Martin Luther King, Jr.
This paper is an up~to-date revision of the one by the same title prepared
under the date of October 16, 1963. In updating it we emphasized three
main areas: (1) the continued dependence of King upon former Communist
Party, USA members, current and former Party sympathizers_and his continued
reliance on the long-time communist!Staniey David Levison;/ (2) facts
relating to the moral degeneracy of King; and (3) the recent and current
Party aims and activities: relative to the racial_movement.

RECOMMENDATION:

Upon approval, consideration will be given to appropriate dissemina~
tion; When approved, the paper should be returned to the Domestic 7
Intelligence Division for printing. and the preparation of appropriat
letters if disseminated. : a FORMATION CONTAINED

From F. J. Baumgardner

RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF
’ SOUTHERN taal LEADERSHIP CORFERENCE

Laie

“U. S, Government are involved, The Atlanta Office has

recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D. Georgia) be
advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable
since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only aggravate the racial stuation that exists in the
South. A

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,
NSF, should be,furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCIC and King. In this regard
we recently disseminated to the White House and the
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret
summary entitled "Communism and the Negz le
Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the
SCIC and King, This summary deals with ng's communist
connections and his personal gjgmorai 2 ties, With the
receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCLC would
undoubtedly pe removed ti SF prograw to obtain quat
Negro students for southern schools,

ut2258
Lan eGa

The information concerning the SCIC participation ~
in the NSF prograin is being separately disseminated to the
Department and interested intelligence agencies. °- . .

RECO AT TON s

r There is attached for approval a Letter to

Dr, Ieland J, Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy
of the recently prepared summary entitled ommunism and

Mr. Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed, 9, \
that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought pais}
up to date,

This is an excellent suggestion and we have already
started the necessary research, Bringing this monograph up to
date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Wash-
ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level
officials in Government of the wholly disreputable character
of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was
originally scheduled for early April, 1968, However, our
Washington Field Office has developed information that King's
group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals
to participatein the demonstration and the date for the project
has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968,

Because of the importance of doing a thorough. job on “J
this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring togethe}’
the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it 7
in a hard-hitting manner, To make the brief timely, we will
have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968,

The Attorney General

NOTE:

Issue raised by the SSC here is that they have
detected in their investigation of the Internal Revenue
Service and through review of Cointelpro documents furnished
to them by the FBI instances relating to FBI use of tax
return information, Included in this material were a
number of cases in which the FBI locally requested and,
according to the documents, recéived tax returns or tax
return information from Internal Revenue Service employees,
Earlier the SSC had sought to interview individuals who
assisted us in several of our Cointelpro operations, We
successfully resisted these attempts to obtain the identities
of such individuals and our assent to such interview by the
SSC. We were sustained in our position by the Attorney
General, Our position was based on the fact that we considered
that we had an obligation, expressed or implied, of confi-
dentiality toward such sources who had acted on our behalf,

The SSC now raises a question as to whether our
position concerning contacts with and identities of employees
of the Internai Revenue Service is the same as with the
"confidential sources," For the reasons cited in our letter
we do not believe it would be possible to sustain such an
argunent,

SUBJECT:“Senate Select Committee Request Et ea

The attached letter is self-explanatory and, put in distilled
form, asks the following question:

Are employees of the IRS who supplied tax returns or tax
return information to agents of the FBI in response to formal or
informal requests made by Bureau agents to be characterized as -
"confidential sources" and, as such, to be spared being interviewed
by the Select Committee?

Because the Attorney General and the Bureau have previously
addressed the Bureau's position on the nondisclosure of its sources
for interview purposes by the SSC staff, and because the issue raised
in the attached letter may represent a clear exception to the earlier
resolution of the Bureau's COINIELPRO-sources problem, I am forwarding
this to you for your prompt attention and views for early transmittal
to the Attorney General. I shall appreciate the receipt of your

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Esq.
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination
Office of the Deputy Attorney General

U. S. Department of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mike:

In connection with our investigation of the
Internal Revenue Service, we have received a number of FBI
COINTELPRO documents relating to FBI use of tax return
information. Included in this material are a number of !
cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according
to the documents, received tax returns or tax return in-
formation from IRS employees, such as the local Chief of
Audit or Chief of Intelligence. 7

We wish to determine whether these requests
were tréated by the IRS as official requests and pre-
scribed procedures thus followed for disclosure of the
information, or whether the requests were treated as
informal requests and prescribed procedures ignored. We
cannot make this determination solely on the basis of the
FBI documents we have reviewed. In many cases, the only ~
way to determine how the requests were treated will be to
interview the IRS employees who handled the requests.

Since these requests were directed to a federal
agency, we are proceeding on the basis of a presumption
that the responses were properly cleared. If so, we do
not believe there is any basis for characterizing.the IRS
employees in question as “confidential sources". They
would then be in essentially the same position as the Com-.
missioner of Internal Revenue is ‘where the request is
directed through normal channels to the National Office

Eh oa dats,



— e e

« ¢ Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Esq.
Page Two September 5, 1975

and responded to officially. In the event it should turn
out that the responses were not officially approved, they
were nonetheless made by federal employees who should
have been acting within the scope of their official duties
and who, if they were not so acting, should certainly be
subject to interrogation regarding the circumstances of
their acting outside their authority.

: In what is perhaps an excess of ‘caution in view
of the pending discussions regarding the questioning of
“confidential sources", we are submitting this situation
for your review lest you should disagree with our analysis
that these individuals cannot properly be so characterized.
Because IRS hearings are scheduled for the last week in
September, our need to question the people who released
the returns is very urgent, and we would appreciate your
‘advising us of your view on the subject at the earliest.
possible moment -- hopefully no later than Monday, Septem-
ber 8th. : .

On 9/9/75, John E1L1iff, Domestic Task Force Head of
the Senate Select Committee, telephonically contacted SA Paul V.
Daly and requested that SA_Douglas Ma gall be released for
purposes of submitting to a Staff interview concerning mail
openings.

E1lif£ stated that he was currently being: interviewed
by Senate Select Committee Staff Members on mail covers; however,
he indicated there is an apparent misunderstanding as the Senaté: ti
Select Committee also requested that he be made available for ;
Staff interview on mail openings at the same time. EJlLiff was [/
advised that this was not true and that James Dick of the Senate.
Select Committee had requested only a release insofar as mail
covers was concerned for purposes of an interview with MacDougall
and that this particular topic had been confirmed with Dick on a
separate occasion to insure that their intent insofar as MacDougall
was. concerned was to interview him on mail covers. E1Liff then
requested that MacDougall be released for mail openings and in-
quired as to how long this particular procedure might take. He
was informed that prior to MacDougall's being made available for
such an interview the Bureau would brief MacDougall concerning
his Fifth Amendment rights and would want MacDougall to. have
sufficient time to consider whether he might want to retain
private counsel or whatever other steps he feels necessary to
protect his rights.

E11if£ subsequently recontacted SA Paul V. Daly
telephonically and stated he had checked with James Dick,

Senate Select Committee Staff Member, and determined that
Dick had only asked that MacDougall be made, available for

interview concerning mail covers. El11Liff£ ree that since #743

purposes of the mail openings interview. He also informed
SA Daly that after the mail covers interview, MacDougall
will return to the Bureau so that he can be appropriately
briefed by the Legal Counsel Division concerning his Fifth
Amendment rights’

RECOMMENDATION:
That SA MacDougall be released from existing

‘employment agreement for purposes of interview by the
Senate Select Committee concerning mail openings.

Labor Day weekend to suit his personal convenience

or to fit his personal travel plans. He was pleasant,
low-keyed, and not at all aggressive or probing and I
had the impression that he learned nothing during the
interview that he had not known before. I told him

on several occasions during the interview that my memory
i of this ten year old matter is very poor, that he should
i rely on the records made at the time for a more accurate
account.

"I also had the impression that he is pursuing
leads based on material furnished to him by Sullivan." \

DATE 12 BY He
U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike
Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He
said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day
weekend and asked whether I would be available for
interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.
Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed
to meét me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,
August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between
3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in
amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked
during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge
in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to
December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before
that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta
(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau
career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps
maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and
removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there
were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told
him I was not aware of any. In response to these and
other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and
that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information
which might answer his questions. I told him that every-
thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs
from the record, he should rely on the record to determine
what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to
your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King
coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told
him I did not recall, but that in any case it was
approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in

which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He
} asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I
1 do not now recall whether I was told why they were
: discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the
reason. He asked whether we had a bug on King as opposed
to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were
possible there were taps and bugs placed and maintained
without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible
because of the size of the office and the relationship
I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was
done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any
Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled
none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent
King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere
with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a
banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director
William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him

Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional
conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the
Klan. Hé wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan
and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met
with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,
that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,
but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked
the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a
meeting took place it was in the nature of a social

call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a
public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there
was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding
any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked
whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta
and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry
made by the Bureau into the handling of the King
investigation either through the Inspection Staff or
otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked
whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King
investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I
told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not
recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.
I told him Sehtinella was there when I arrived and was
still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had
supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor
Charles Harding.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE Z

RE: ‘Senate Select Committee () \ a
: ’senstu hy) lace 2 ve i
[ .)

On the afternoon of August 19, 1975, fin Ellif of the
SSC staff, telephoned me to report that the Committee has
decided to defer on its pending request for the identity of
various so-called "recipient-source" witnesses in the COINTEL

program. - 7A ft
. zi har
pesesdiaast (

Mr. El1lif also emphasized that he wished to apologize Wy:
to the Attorney General for possibly misstating the grounds Desi fe
as to why the Committee and the staff had decided to reject
the proposals apparently agreed upon by Senator Church and me

the Attorney General.

Finally, I noted to John Ellif that I continue to have Z A escisaete
difficulty in understanding why the staff insists that they

need further witnesses to establish any possible "damage" to

the targets of the COINTEL program. Ellif-finally agreed

that since they do know the names and identities of the targets, :
the latter probably would be the best witnesses on this issue ‘fi
in any event. Nonetheless, Ellif did stress that it.is possible VA
that later on in the fall, the Committee and its staff may choose °*
to come back and press its demands for the right to interview

the recipient-source witnesses.

Senator Howard Baker had reviewed the information con-
tained in Bureau files pertaining to him per instructions
of the Attorney General and in response to the letter from
Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee,

be made available for review by his designee on the Senate
Select Committee, James Madigan. This file is titled ALLEGED
TAPPING OF TELEPHONE OF UNITED STATES SENATOR HOWARD BAKER,
WASHINGTON, D. C. (Bufile 139-4744). Shaheen was asked what
the Department position was. concerning this particular requesi
inasmuch as. the file had been made available to the Senator
pursuant to the instructions of the, Attorney General.

Shaheen advised that inasmuch‘as the initial request
was from the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee for access
to files for Senators that any modification of that request
_giving access to Senate Select Committee Staff Members should
also be pursuant to a communication from the Chairman of that
Committee. Shaheen indicated that making sane file available pea

By a prior oral arrangement between Mr. Mark ae
Gitenstein, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee (SSC), a: ee
Me. W. B. Wannall, Assistant Director, Intelligence Division (INTD),

a briefing was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on 8/28/75. This
briefing was to consist of a discussion of the various indices
maintained, and.operated-by the FBI. Information pertaining
to these indices had previously been submitted the SSC by
letterhead memorandum dated July 17, 1975, and documents
pertaining to the indices were made available for review by
appropriately cleared SSC Staff Members at FBI Headquarters.

This briefing was held in the conference room of
the INTD, JEH Building, on 8/28/75 during the approximate
period 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Present at this meeting were
Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Settion Chief J. G. Deegan
Unit Chief E,. P, Grigalus, SA K. A. Mendenhall, all of the
INTD, Mark Gitenstein, Michael Epstein, and Martha Talley,
Staff Members of the SSC.

Main items of discussion during this briefing ee
centered around the Rabble Rouser x (RRI), later known as
the Agitator Index (AI); the Key_A Program (KAP), the
Security I dex (SI), and the Admini ‘Index (ADEX). The
origin and implementation of the ab oned indices and
the KAP were discussed and Mr. Wannall offered background
information and historical reasoning as to the necessity for
implementing these indices and the KAP. Mr. Deegan answered
questions pertaining to the AI and Messts Grigalus and
Mendenhall answered questions pertaining to the KAP, the “4

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

were advised there is no plan of action in the FBI for the
apprehension of the individuals so listed. The SSC Staff
Members were advised individuals currently listed on the
ADEX would merely be afforded priority investigative attention
during any national emergency which should occur; however,
they would not be apprehended. SSC Staff Members also
indicated they felt criteria for inclusion on the ADEX
when first established were the same as the criteria for
inclusion on the old SI. They were advised when the ADEX
Program was initiated the criteria were basically the same;
however, after closely following the matter for a period
of approximately 8 months, the criteria were reevaluated
and revised so only individuals who were considered
currently dangerous were to be included on the ADEX.

SSC Staff Members were also advised that the SI was

stored "off-line" in the Bureau's computers and as such
was utilized in a strictly in-house operation. Informa-
tion was therefore not available to outside agencies or
terminals tied in with the Bureau's computer system.

Staff Members also indicated from a review of material
made available to them it appeared as though there was
friction between the Bureau and the Department during the
late 1940s and early 1950s with respect to establishing
guidelines and policy in connection with the SI and they
desired to know what the cause of this friction was. INTD
representatives present advised they were unaware of the
cause of any such friction.

Other questions similar to those above were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and were answered by INTD personnel
present. In addition the following nine questions were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and Mr. Wannall indimted answers
would be obtained and orally furnished:

1. Was there a memorandum which established the
RRI and does it indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before the
Civil Unrest Commission? (A memorandum dated 3/67, from
Cc. D. Brennan to Mr. W. C, Sullivan indicates + Hoover
instructed an index be compiled of racial agitators; however,
the memorandum does not indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before
the Civil Unrest Commission.)

2. Was there a memorandum concerning the
expansion of the AI to include individuals of local
prominence? (Memorandum of G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C.
Sullivan dated 11/22/67 requested approval of an SAC
letter for expanding the AI to include local leaders as
well as national leaders involved in racial disorders.)

3. Were individuals included on both the AI and
the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?
(Individuals were included on both the AI and the SI;
however, this was not necessarily a duplication of effort
inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized in the apprehension
and detention of individuals considered dangerous and the
AI was an administrative aid to follow the activities and
movement of individuals attempting to cause racial
disorders.)

4, When did the SI become automated and was the
Reserve Index (RI) ever automated? (The SI became automated
during the early 1950s and was updated throughout the years
with the advancement of computer technology and purchase
by the Bureau of more advanced computers, Following
discontinuance of the SI the ADEX was continued in the
computer systems in an "off-line" manner. The RI-A-
was placed on automatic data processing (ADP) equipment
the same as the SI. RI-B was maintained at the field
level only and was never placed in the ADP equipment.)

5. Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's

portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)
been returned? (One copy of the Attorney General's
portfolio concerning the EDP has been located and is
currently maintained in the Security Informant Unit of
the IS-2 Section, INTD.)

6. Who were the Bureau individuals who
(a) maintained the Attorney General's portfolio during
1968 and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?
(The following individuals were identified through
review of pertinent communications during time pexryod
in question: (a) 1968 - C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow,
T. P. Rosack; (b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J. C. Strickland;
1948-Lish Whitson, W. H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

Re: Senstudy 75

7. When did the Department start reviewing and
approving the SI list? (Matters pertaining to the old
Custodial Detention List were first referred to the
Department during March, 1941. Copies of the SI were
submitted to the Department during 1951 and the Department,
on a continuing basis, reviewed matters pertaining to the
SI except for brief periods of time when funds and manpower
were not available until the SI was discontinued in 1971.)

8. Was there a form used by the Department
concerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals
on the SI and, if so, what does the form look like?
(Forms were utilized and copies have been obtained to
exhibit to SSC Staff Members.)

9. Do we have a copy of the form for including
or deleting an individual from the AI? (FD-397 was
utilized with the AI. A copy of this form will be
exhibited to SSC Staff Members.)

At the closure of this briefing SSC Staff Members
expressed their appreciation to the Bureau personnel present
and indicated the briefing had furnished them a better
understanding of the Bureau's utilization of the above
indices and the KAP.

ACTION:

With your approval and in accordance with your
previous instructions the Senstudy Unit will initiate contact
with Mr. Gitenstein so answers relating to the above nine
questions may be orally provided to the above-named SSC
Staff Members.

by Bureau officials before the Senate Select Committee that
the Committee tentatively scheduled hearings for mid-October.
He cited October 16th as being the approximate date. Ini-
tially, according to E1liff£, hearings. concerning the Bureau
were to have been initiated in the first week of October but
the Staff Members did not have the necessary background in-
formation to conduct the hearings at that time and instead
scheduled hearings. concerning IRS for early October.

these hearings would be to furnish the Bureau an outline of j~“‘

or a series of questions pertaining to the area to be covered
in testimony prior to our appearance. He indicated that the \«
hearings would cover a narrow topic on any given day so that

ELLiff indicated that it was the Committee's intent

they are initiated with the Bureau testifying at least once
a week during that period. He advised they also envisioned
the initial hearing as setting forth what the scope of the
Senate Select Committee inquiry had been into the FBI and of

On 8/25/75, SA Daly determined from Michael
Epstein of the Senate Select Committee that this
particular interview was not considered an "abuse"
interview and if the Bureau so desired, they could have
a representative present during the interview. Accord-

Dear Mr. Daly:

Enclosed is a list of documents which the Senate Select
pommittee, on Intelligence Activities may decide to declassify
‘or its public hearings on the Huston Plan. We invite your
opinion on any sections which you think ought to be sanitized
before declassification. Of course, the great majority of
key documents on the Huston Plan are already a matter of public
record,

Since these hearings may be held as early as September 23rd
and certainly by early October, your quick response would be
most helpful. Zs

Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Mike: DED

sy

The following two documents, which relate to the Martin
Luther King, Jr. matter, are the subject of a pending Committee
‘request for documents:

A. Airtel dated 2/12/62 from SAC, New York, to
Director, FBI, subject "Dr. Martin Luther KIng,
dr., SM-C (00:Atlanta) ;"and

B. Airtel dated 8/15/66 from SAC, New York, to
Director, FBI, subject "Communist Party, USA,
Counterintelligence Program, Internal Security
- C (Stanley David Levison)."

: These two documents had been previously provided to the
Committee in heavily or almost completely excised form.
Virtually the entire contents of Item A. (a 3-page airtel)
were excised because "it could. result in identification of an
FBI informant," and more than 12 pages of Item B. (a 29-page
airtel) were excised because such portions contained information
which “tends to identify highly sensitive sources of continuing
value. A third document which is needed by the Committee, and
which would presumably also be provided by the Bureau only in
excised form is a New York field office letter to the Bureau
dated 6/21/62 as “cited in the last paragraph of page 9 of the
10/11/62 memorandum from the SAC, Atlanta, to ppulegrax,

FBI, subject "Communist Infiltration of the So Lesi
Leadership Conference, IS-C (00: Atlanta) ."

The Bureau's position with respect to the excised portions
of Items A. and B. above was reiterated by FBI representatives
at our September 9 meeting, notwithstanding our position that
these materials were deemed to be absolutely essential to our
complete understanding of the King investigation. As you are
aware, several other documents previously provided to the
Committee contain conclusionary statements about Stanley Levison
as predicates for many of the actions taken with respect to
King, and it would appear that the withheld portions of
Items A. and B. above, as well as the 6/21/62 New York letter
described above, would contain the detailed bases for such
conclusions.

I am sure you would agree that the underlying facts
concerning Levison are vital in order that we can meet our
responsibilities to fully assess the propriety of the FBI's
activities with respect to this case. Accordingly, I would

_ appreciate your personal attention to this matter, including
your own examination of the three documents in question, and
hopefully, a determination by you that these documents should
be provided to the Committee in unexcised form (except for the
names of so-called “live" informants).

An early resolution of this matter is essential, and I
would hope you can respond by the end of the week.

Sincerely,

Senate Select Committee (SSC) convened public
hearings 9-16-75, at which Chairman Frank Church an-
nounced the chief purpose of the inquiry was. to examine
the role of CIA disobeying direct orders of President
Nixon who had ordered the destruction of biological/
bacteriological agents and weapons of war by Presidential
Order, 11-25-69. Chairman Church referred to previous
executive testimony of Director Colby which established
that CIA had maintained a supply of approximately 6 grams
of shellfish toxin, a lethal agent, until June, 1975, in
apparent contravention of the Presidential Order of 1969. f
The retention of the toxin had been ordered by a midlevel La
employee without the knowledge of former Director Richard oo

Helms.
Pall

While Chairman Church stressed it is not the
purpose of SSC to denigrate the importance of the FBI
and the CIA of their contribution to the welfare of the
United States, he stated subsequent SSC hegyings would
highlight the necessity that Federal law his ment and
intelligence agencies operate in a manner whi¢hywill not ]

infringe upon the rights of American citizens,

Re: SENSTUDY 75

CIA directive to destroy or impinge on his d@cision to
maintain the toxins and, further, the Presidential Order
was directed toward offensive biological weapons of war
in possession of the Department of Defense. Additionally,
Dr. Gordon pointed out that the shellfish toxin over
which he had custody was a chemical substance and could
not be classified as a biological weapon.

Former Director Helms will appear before SSC in

SUBJECT: ~ Senate Select Committee Request for IRS Information

Reference is made to my memoranda of September 9, and
September 11, 1975 (copies of which are attached), by which I
forwarded to you copies of the September 4, 1975, letter from
SSC Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General and the letter
of "modification" dated September 10, 1975s from John Elliff to
me.

I have been orally adviséd (and will be in receipt of a
confirming letter today) that the very long list of names and
organizations about whom tax information was and is sought by
Schwarz's September 4, letter was intended to apply as well to
the Bureau for its response.

The Bureau is, therefore, requested to provide relevant
materials_and documents pertaining to Bureau :
‘returns and tax retumn information, on on the individuals and “|
organizations listed in Mr. Schwarz’s letter ‘of September 4. |
Tn other words, the request made in the September 4, letter is
for Bureau response except as Elliff's letter of modification
exempts | the raw files of the Bureau from inclusion in this
“Yequest. eee

The SSC staff requests that materials be assembled on the
named individuals and organizations in the same order as they
are listed ,in the letter and that when a response for a given

name or organization involves B) volume of materials or

Merk Gitenstein or Art Harrigan of the SSC staff that response, in
such an instance, will be voluminous and should be refined by
consultation.

I am advised, as usual, that because the SSC anticipates
early hearings on the materials specifically sought by this request,
this request enjoys urgent priority. Please prepare as prompt a
response as possible. 7

(I am attaching the letter confirming the oral advise that
the September 4, letter applies to the Bureau; that letter was

Dear Mike:

As Mark and you discussed today.on the phone,
it was the Committee's intent in Fritz Schwarz' letter to
you of September 4, 1975, that the FBI, as well as the
Internal Security Division, provide information pertaining
to the individuals and organizations listed in that letter.
Of course this letter and the August 29 letter are modified
by my letter of September 10. Furthermore, this request is
of the highest priority and therefore we want to be kept
informed of its progress on a daily basis. Perhaps the
: " best approach would be to have Bureau representatives con-
awison! tact either Mark Gitenstein or Art Harrigan immediately so
al that we might prioritize the names listed in the September
4 letter.

SUBJECT:

VYodification of SSC Request :

" Attached is a letter from John ELUff of the SSC staff
which modifies the lancuage of the August 29, letter fron the SSCs
Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General. The last sentence
of the first paragraph of the August 29, letter read as follows:

5 “Where an Internal Security Division request was
made with respect to a person or organization on whom
- the Internal Security Division or the FSI maintained
or maintains a file, we would appreciate the opportu-
nity to review the entire file. (emhasis mine)

The modification of the first paragraph effected by the attached
letter deletes the words “or the FBI" as underlined above. Such
a modification exempts the raw files of the Bureau from inclusion
in this request. The request still requires response by the
Bureau for "all documents" in its possession as requested of the
entire Department generally by the modified first paragraph.

listing for Post Office Box 515 in Rancho, Santa Fe, California.
Bushong indicated that the fact he was attached to the Senate
Select Committee could be verified by inquiry with Staff Director
Bill Miller or Security Officer Ben Marshall of that Committee.

Mark Gitenstein of the Senate Select Committee was
telephonically contacted by SA Paul V. Daly and advised of the
request received from David Bushong. He was informed that the
Bureau did not have authority to conduct an investigation for
the Senate Select Committee in the absence of instructions from
the Attorney General and that the Bureau would not conduct
an investigation in the absence of same. Gitenstein agreed that
the Bureau should not conduct the investigation and indicated he
would bring this to the attention of Bushong.

Subsequently, ASAC Arthur Barger of the San Diego

Bushong and asked to make available to him information he had
requested the Bureau to furnish. Barger was informed that the

mittee. He indicated that this request. had been discussed with
the Deputy Attorney General's Office and was an investigation
being. conducted by Senate Tower and Kurt Smothers, Minority
Counsel. He requested that SA Daly contact Michael E. Shaheen,
Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the De-
partment, to verify that arrangements have been made for the
Bureau to conduct this investigation.

: SA Daly contacted Shaheen and Shaheen advised that
he knew nothing of this request. Shaheen was informed that
absent specific instructions from the Attorney General the
Bureau would not conduct the requested investigation and
Shaheen agreed that this was the proper position for the
Bureau. Shaheen was informed that the Senate Select Com-
mittee Staff Member conducting the investigation was David
Bushong and Shaheen stated that he knew Bushong and Bushong
had formerly been the Administrative Assistant to former
Attorney General William Saxbe.

Subsequently, John Bayley, Assistant Minority
Counsel for the Senate Select Committee, telephonically con-
tacted SA Daly and apologized for the request that the Bureau
conduct an investigation for the Senate Select Committee and
he indicated that he thought arrangements had been made for
this investigation through the Deputy Attorney General's Office.
Bushong advised that Senator Tower was currently attempting to
locate the Attorney General to straighten out this particular
problem and apparently arrange for the Bureau to conduct such
an investigation.
