A brieting for Senators Church and Tower has been provided

covering warrantless electronic surveillances. surreptitious entry for

recovery ot cryptographic material, teletype covcrage requested by the

National Security Agency and electronic penetration of communications

equipment requested by the National Eecurity Agency. «The White House

asked that agencies of the intelligence community not respond to any

requests from the SSC covering these matters until the briefing had been

given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowledge of these matters

to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information

throughout the SaC staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the

enclosed material not ke made available to the SSC staff until it is dis-

cussed with the White House. I further urge that it be made clear to the

White Flouse that it this material is to be made available to the SSc that

access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower,

and SSC Stalf Director William Miller only.

A copy of the memorandum is enclosed for your records.

Diractor Sec'y -

On September 17, 1975, Mary Wagner, an attorney in the office

of the Deputy Attorney General, accompanied by Bruce Baird, an attorney

recently appointed to the Deputy's office, met with me in my office and

advised that they have been assigned the responsibility of drafting guidelines

for the Attorney General's approval concerning legal representation of

Department employees. She explained that they view the problem of

legal advice to employees as larger than the request made by the FBI

concerning Bureau employees, and that the guidelines would address the

larger problem. She asked for my suggestions concerning the proposed

guidelines.

I told Miss Wagner that in the beginning of the inquiries received

from the Senate and House Select Committees, we had been advised bý the

Department that a conflict of interest would prohibit Department attorneys,

including lawyers in the FBi, from providing legal representation individually

to the employees of the FBi in inatters relating to the Senate and House

inquiries. As a consequence we have been advising our employees of the

procedures involved in Congressional committee interviews and appearances

for testimony; the limitations imposed on the employees in regard to sensitive

areas of testimony which might require special approval; their right to

counsel and of the limitation imposed on us that personal counsel would have

to be privately employed. I told Miss Wagner that my reading of the

Attorney General's memorandum for the Director dated September 12, 1975,

was that the Attorney General intended to make personal legal advice available

to employees requesting it and that we would like for the guidelines io be

written broadly enough for employees to receive effective assistance of legal

counsel.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

I suggested to her that the Attorney General might approve the

appointment of a special counsel within the Department whose responsibilities

would be somewhat similar to those imposed on the Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination in that he would be relieved of other Department

responsibilities and his allegiance would be only to discharging the obligations

of personal counsel when requested by an employee. I suggested that such

special designation would permit the Department lawyer so assigned to

avoid the conflict of interest problem and at the same time it would impose

on him the obligations of the attorney-client privilege.

Miss Wagner commented that she understood that in some cases

handled by the Civil Division of the Department, Government attorneys

represent employees in civil suits, but require that the employee waive

the attorney-client privilege to the extent that should the Government employee

become aware of information that should be communicated to another division

of the Department, the attorney would furnish such information to the other

division. If the attorney learned of criminal conduct on the part of the

employee, he would not be prohibited by the attorney client privilege from

making such conduct known to the Department.

I told Miss Wagner that an essential element of the relationship

between the special counsel for furnishing advice to employees would be

that the attorney-client privilege would apply and it would not be possible

for such a waiver to be required in exchange for providing legal advice.

She agreed.

I suggested to Miss Wagner that the Department special counsel

could be available for consultation concerning such matters as appearances

before Congressional committees and for such preliminary advice as would be

useful to employees called to testify. At the point where the special counsel

determined that the employee required more in-depth legal assistance in order

to protect his legal rights, the special counsel could recommend to the

Deputy Attorney General that the employee should be afforded an opportunity

to have private counsel whose fees would be paid by the Department of

Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

In regard to the question of security clearance for such outside

counsel and the possibility that an employee might seek to employ an

attorney whose background would suggest that he would not be approved

for security clearance, I told Miss Wagner that the provision of private

counsel to an employee would be done in the discretion of the Department

and

I that a reasonable limitation could well be imposed by the Department

as to those attorneys in private practice who would be eligible for appoint-

ment to represent individual employees. Such limitation would permit

the Department and the employee to agree upon an attorney who would be

qualified for security clearance.

Miss Wagner inquired as to when the Department's responsibility

for furnishing legal counsel to an employee should terminate. I told her

that an appropriate time would be when the Department advised the

employee that a decision had been made to prosecute the employee. Up

to that point the inquiries would have been directed toward the determination

of the circumstances and that the employer-employee relationship would

justify protecting the legal rights of the employee, but at the point at

which the Government determines and so advises the employee that the

employee would be prosecuted, the Government and the employee would

become adversaries.

We discussed the provision in Federal law for the appointment of

counsel for Federal defendants in cases where the defendant is indigent.

I suggested that they consider the possibility that even in those cases

where an employee is to be prosecuted, the Department consider the

possibility of employing existing law to provide counsel to employees

who may become defendants in criminal cases.

As to the scope of the representation of the employee, I told

Miss Wagner that the initial need is for legal advice in situations where

an employee is called for au interview or testimony by Members,

committees, subcommittees, or other units of the Congress. However, I

explained that due to the publicity oi the Congressional inquiries, others may

well be interested in pursuing independent inquiries concerning the same

matters or other matters and that employees may well request legal

advice when they are called for interview or testimony by the Criminal

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employces

Division of the Department, the Civil Rights Division of the Department,

or other Federal Government entities including Federal Grand Juries.

Further, state and local prosecutors and grand juries may seek to inquire

concerning matters within their jurisdiction arising out of the employee's

Federal activities and the employee would require the assistance of counsel.

Therefore, I asked Miss Wagner to include in the guidelines a provision

that legal counsel would be available through the Department for employees

in all circumstances where the employee is being questioned concerning

matters arising out of his employment in the FBI.

I told Miss Wagner that the concluding paragraph in the Attorney

General's memorandum for the Director indicated the possibility that a

determination would be made in some cases that the employee's activities

were beyond the scope of his duties and in such cases legal counsel would

not be provided. I told her that such a determination would be critical

and the policy followed in making such decisions would color the entire

program of providing legal assistance to employees. Therefore, I

requested Miss Wagner to address the question of scope of duties

in the

guidelines by expressing a presumption that the employee's activities

were within the scope of his duties and that such presumption would be

overcome only by a showing of facts clearly indicating to the contrary,

and that such determination would be made at least by the Deputy Attorney

General himself.

I told Miss Waguer that this matter was most urgent and that the

Special Agents of the FBI throughout the field are anxiously awaiting the

announcement of the Attorney General's policy in regard to availability

of legal advice to employees concerning matters arising out of their

employment. She advised me that wo. is would begin immediately and that

she would be in touch with me concerning its progress, and to discuss

the guidelines as they are developed.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFE MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike

Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He

said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day

weekend and asked whether I would be available for

interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.

Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed

to meet me at my

home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,

August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between

3:40 pm and 4:05 pm.

This included the time spent in

amenities ana general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked

during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge

in Atlanta.

I told him from April or May 1964 to

December 1966.

He asked

where I had been assigned before

that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta

(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau

He asked if I were aware of telephone taps

maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware. of certain taps placed and

He asked if there

were such coverage before 1 arrived In Atlanta and 1 told

him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other

subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and

that after ten years I cannot now clearly

recall information

which might answer his questions...I told him that every

thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs

from the record, he should rely on the recora to determine

what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the king

coverage originated

at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told

him I did not recall, but that in any case it was

approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored

and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment

rented for that purpose.

He asked if I knew the name in

which the apartment was

rented and I said I did not. He

asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I

do not now recall whether I was told why they were

discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the

reason.

He asked whether we

had a bug on King

as opposed

to a tap and I told him, "no."

He asked whether it were

possible there were taps and 'bugs placed and maintained

without my knowledge.

I told him that was not possible

because of the size of the office and the relationship

I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was

done without my

knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any

Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled

He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent

King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere

with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a

banquet to honor king for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director

William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him

Sullivan haã been to Atlanta in connection with a regional

conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the

Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan

and I told him I thought so.

He asked who else had

accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had

accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose

name

I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met

but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

made by the Bureau into the handling of the King

otherwise.

I told him I was not aware of any.

He asked.

whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King

investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I

IRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFE MEMBER

On August 20, 1975, Ir. Loch Johnson of the Senate

Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect

to inteligence Activities lost stari interviewed me in my

office,

Roon 4821, JEH Building, concerning my knowledge of,

and participation in, the so-called "Huston Plan."

Mr. Johnson did not place me under oath or advise me

of my rights.

le asked about my background which I provided, including

the fact that I have been a Special Agent of the FBI since

August 7, 1050.

With regard to the extent of my participation in the

Huston Plan, I advised Mc. Johnson that I vas selected by former

Assistant Dircctor Willian C. Sullivan to act as the liaison

officer for the plan, probably because of ny experience in the

FBI Domestic Liaison

Section and my extensive liaison contacts

through my participation in the various United States Intelligence

Board (USIB) Committees.

My duties with regard to the Huston Plan

were to insure that appropriate notification of meetings vas made

and that the various papers prepared as the result of meetings

held were delivered to the proper indivicuals in the other agencies

participating in the plan.

Some of the papers were delivered

personally by me, others were sent by courier.

I advised Ir. Johnson that I was generally aware of

the contents oi the papers prepared through my attendance at the

meetings of the working group and discussions with participating

personnel; hovever, I porsonally made no input nor did I participate

in the preparation of the workpapers or the finished product.

Ik. Johnson asked if I had not Tom Charles Huston

prior to the initial mooting of the Huston Plan working group.

I advised him that I had never heard of lluston prior to the

mentioning of his name by W. C. Sullivan at the initial necting

of FBI personnel involved in the Huston Plan, which meeting

occurred early in June, 1970, and had never seen him until the

first neting of the working group held at CIA Headquarters,

Langloy, Virginia, shortly thereaiter.

personnel concerning the Huston Plan. I told him it was held

in Mr. Sullivan's conference room in the Federal Triangle

Building and that as best as I could recall it was attended by

hr. Sullivan and the branch Inspectors of the Intelligenco

Division as well as the Section Chiefs. Sullivan told us of

the plan and as I recall indicated this was & golden opportunity

to regain the coverage afforded by techniques, which had been

denied us for the most part, since 1957.

I told hin that in my

viev Sullivan vas going to make this one last effort to regain

the coverage and if this effort failed was prepared to retiro.

Mr. Johnson asked if former Inspector I. J. Smith was

at this meeting. I told him I could not recall.

The initial meeting of the Ad Hoc group at CIA was

discussed and I advised him that, as I recalled, at that meeting

it was decided that cach participating agency would submit a

paper listing the restraints on their particular agency which

were hampering them in doing their job. I pointed out that the

FBI subritted an extensive list of restraints and that this paper

was circulated to the other participating agencies without being

cleared through ir. Hoover.

Ir. Johnson asked ii I was avare of who was tho

instigator of the Huston Plan.

I told hin I had no direet

fluston, ox

however, the answer to his question would have to be obtained

from those individuals or such records as he nay be able to

Locate.

He asked my impression of Ion Charles Huston. I told

hin I felt luston vas a vory bright young nan who saw this plan

as an opportunity to become the llenry Kissinger of domestic

security and thereby enhance hinself and his political career.

Mr'. Johnson stated that his investigation had developed

that Sullivan at the outset of the plan appeared to want to push

through the plan; hovover, he scened to take a direct turnabout

and began to advise It. Hoover against adopting some oi the

proposals being made by the various participating agencies.

Fle

said it was his inpression that this turnabout occurred at the

time Sullivan was promoted to Number Three Man in the Burcau.

He asked if I could shed any light on this turn of events.

I told Mr. Johnson that I could not speak for Sullivan

and could only give him my impression of what occurred, that being

at the outset of the plan Sullivan truly felt this was a golden

opportunity to get the coverage back,

and docided to lay his job

on the line to accomplish this.

When he was moved up to the

Number Three job, I felt he saw the opportunity to someday beconc

the Director on the 11sl.

Furthcr, as the drafts of the plan were

being written, Sullivan realized that sooner or later Mr. Hoover

would see then and at that time realizo that Sullivan had

disser-

inated to the Intelligence community all of

the restraints

Mx. Hoover had imposed on the IBI.

Mr. Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed,

that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought

Runc

up to date.

This is an excellent

suggestion and we have already

started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to

date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Wash-

ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level

officials in Government of the wholly disreputable character

of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was

originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our

Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals

to participatein the demonstration and the date for the project

has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough, job on

the nose in condu are date a fine to en ten the

the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it

even to bring togethe

To make the brief timely, we will

have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

The Attorney General

NOTE:

Issue raised by the SSC here is that they have

detected in their investigation of the Internal Revenue

Service and through review of Cointelpro documents furnished

to them by the FBI instances relating to FBI use of tax

return information. Included in this material vere a

number of cases in which the fBi locally requested and,

according to the documents, received tax returns or tax

return information from Internal Revenue Service employees.

Earlier the SSC had sought to interview individuals who

assisted us in several of our Cointelpro operations. We

successfully resisted these attempts to obtain the identities

of such individuals and our assent to such interview by the

SSC. We were sustained in our position by the Attorney

General,

Our position was based on the fact that we considered

that we

had an obligation, expressed or implied, of confi-

dentiality toward such sources who had acted on our behalf.

The SSC now raises a question as to whether our

position concerning contacts with and identities of employees

of the Internal Revenue Service is the same as with the

"confidential sources."

For the reasons cited in our letter

ve do not believe it would be possible to sustain such an

argument.

Dear Mike:

ALL FBI INTORMAHION CONTAINED

FREEN IN CHAGSINISHO

In connection with our investigation of the

Internal Revenue Service, we have received a number of FBI

COINTELPRO documents relating to FBI use of tax return

information. Included in this material are a number of

cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according

to the documents, received tax returns or tax return in-

formation from IRS employees, such as the local Chief of|

We wish to determine whether these requests

were treated by the IRS as official requests and pre-

scribed procedures thus followed for disclosure of the

information, or whether the requests were treated as

informal requests and prescribed procedures ignored.

We

cannot make this determination solely on the basis of the

FBI documents

we have reviewed. In many cases, the only

way to determine how the requests were treated will be to

interview the IRS employees who handled the requests.

Since these requests were directed to a federal

agency, we are proceeding on the basis of a presumption

that the responses were properly cleared. If so, we do

not believe there is any basis for characterizing. the IRS

employees in question as "confidential sources".

They

would then be in essentially the same position as the com-.

missioner of Internal Revenue is where the request is

directed through normal channels to the National Office

and responded to officially. In the event it should turn

out that the responses were

not officially approved, they

were nonetheless made by feceral employees who should

have been acting within the scope of their official auties

and who, if they were not so acting, should certainly be

subject to interrogation regarding the circumstances of

their acting outside their authority.

In what is perhaps an excess of caution in view

of the pending discussions regarding the questioning of

"confidential sources"

", we are submitting this situation

for your review lest you should disagree with our analysis

that these individuals cannot properly be so characterized.

Because IRS hearings are scheduled for the last week in

September, our need to question the people who released

the returns is very urgent, and we would appreciate your

advising us of your view on the subject at the earliest.

Elliff stated that he was currently being interviewed

he indicated there is an apparent misunderstanding as the Senate

Select Committee also requested that he be made available for

Staff interview on mail openings at the same time. Elliff was

advised that this was not true and that James Dick of the Senate

Select Committee had requested only a release insofar as mail

covers was concerned for purposes of an interview with MacDougall

and that this particular topic had been confirmed with Dick on a

separate occasion to insure that their intent insofar as MacDougall

was concerned was to interview him on mail covers.

Elliff then

requested that MacDougall be released for mail openings and in-

quired as to how. long this particular procedure might take.

was informed that prior to MacDougall's being made available for

such an interview the Bureau would briet MacDougall concerning

his Fifth Amendment rights and would want MacDougall to have

sufficient time to consider whether he might want to retain

private counsel or whatever other steps he leels necessary to

protect his rights.

Elliff subsequently recontacted SA Paul V. Daly

Dick had only asked that MacDougall be made, available Ior

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike

Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He

said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day

weekend and asked whether I would be available for

interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.

Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed

to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,

August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between

3:40 pm and 4:05 pm.

This included the time spent in

amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked

during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge

in Atlanta.

I told him from April or May 1964 to

December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before

that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta

(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau

career.

He asked if I were aware of telephone taps

maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and

removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there

were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told

him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and

that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information

which might answer his questions. I told him that every-

thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs

from the record, he should rely on the record to determine

what happened.

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King

coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta.

I told

him I did not recall, but that in any case it was

approved by the Bureau.

He asked where it was monitored

and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment

rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in

which the apartment was

rented and I said I did not.

He

asked why the taps were discontinued and 1 told him 1

do not now recall whether I was told why they were

discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the

reason.

He asked whether we

had a bug on King as opposed

to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were

possible there were taps and bugs placed and maintained

without my knowledge.

I told him that was not possible

because of the size of the office and the relationship

I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was

done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any

Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled

none.

King

He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent

• from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere

with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a

banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director

William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him

Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional

conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the

Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan

I told him I thought so. He asked who else had

accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had

accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name

I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had

with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta

Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,

that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,

but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

meeting took place it was in the nature of a social

call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a

public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there

was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding

any anti-King activities and I told him, "no."

He asked

whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta

and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry

made by the Bureau into the handling of the King

investigation either through the Inspection Staff or

otherwise.

I told him I was not aware of any.

He asked

whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King

investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I

told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not

recall him.

He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.

I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was

Honorable Clarence E. Kelley

Federal Bureau of Investigation

washington, D.C.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Mr. Kelley:

In accordance with instructions received from

the Bureau, I am enclosing a bill in the amount of $750.00

from the law firm of Kantor, Shaw & Davidoff.

Kantor is an attorney who afted as my counsel during an

appearance by me before the senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Operations in Washington, Doc, on August 12,

1975.

After notification by the Committee and the Bureau

that my appearance had been requested, I was advised by the

Legal Department of the Bureau that I had the right to have

an attorney accompany me during my appearance. I was also

advised by the Bureau that neither they nor the Department

of Justice could provide me with counsel due to a possible

conflict oi interest on their part.

The matters to be discussed before the Committee

involved only my prior official duties in the counter-

intelligence field.

At this point, i strongly believea

that to best protect both my constitutional privileges and

the Bureau's overriding interest, the most prudent course

of action would indicate the retention of an attorney. I

would like to advise you that much

thought was paid to the

selection oi an attorney since confidential Bureau activities

would have to be discussed with him and it was felt that the

person selected would, in effect, be representing the Bureau

in addition to

myself,

19/665-

speczlic legal tees incurred,

as

itemized in

the enclosed

bill, are only in connection with the preparation..a

for and attendánce at my appearance before the Committee..

RE:

Senate Select Committee

ösenstude

1975

On the afternoon of August 19, 1975, John Ellif of the

SSC staff, telephoned me to report that the Committee has

decided to defer on its pending request for the identity of

various so-called "recipient-source" witnesses in the COINTEL

progran.

Mr. Ellif also emphasized that he wished to apologize

to the

Attorney General for possibly misstating the grounds

as to why the Committee and the staff had decided to reject

the proposals apparently agreed upon by Senator Church and

the Attorney General.

Finally, I noted to John Ellif that I continue to have

difficulty in understanding why the staff insists that they

need further witnesses to establish any possiole "damage"

the targets of the COINTEL program.

Ellif finally agreed

that since they do know the names and identities of the

targets,

the latter probably would be the best witnesses on this issue

in any event.

Nonetheless, Ellif did stress that it is possible

that later on in the fall, the Committee and its staff may choose

to come back and press its demands for the right to interview

Ithe recipient-source witnesses.

On 9/10//5, SA Daniel A. Flynn of the New York

Office (NYO) was interviewed by a Staff Member of the U. s.

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) in

its offices in Washington, D. C., on the subject of mail

openings. The interview was recorded by an SSC stenographer.

On the morning of 9/26/75, SAC Robert Denz, NYO,

telephonically contacted Supervisor

S. F. Phillips of the

Senstudy 75 Project and advised that Flynn had been contacted

9/166/21

by James Dick, the SSC Staff Member who had interviewed him.

Dick informed Flynn that the transcript of the interview

is available for review by Flynn but that the review must

Yet. ad.

be done in SSC offices, pursuant to SSC rules. The deadline

3:30 pro

for Flynn's review is 9/30/75.

Also according to SSC rules,

Flynn's review will not permit any substantive changes but

only changes as to grammar, and the like. Flynn desires

the opportunity to review the transcript and authority was

sought for his coming to Washington, D. C., the morning of

9/30/75.

In addition to seeking authority for the trip

SAC Denz inquired as to the position Flynn should take in

the event he reviews the transcript and finds the recording

as inaccurate from a substantive standpoint. Phillips told

Denz that, before coming to Washington, D. C., Flynn ought

to review any notes hehas, as well as the LHM which Flynn

prepared and submitted to the Bureau after the interview.

If Flynn finds that in his opinion the transcript is inaccurate

By a prior oral arrangement between Mr. Mark

Gitenstein, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee (SSC), and

Mc. W. B. Wannall, Assistant Director, Intelligence Division (INTD),

a briefing was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on 8/28/75. This

briefing was to consist of a discussion of the various indices

maintained. and operated..by the FBI.

Information pertaining

to these indices had previously been submitted the SSC by

letterhead memorandum

dated July 17, 1975, and documents

pertaining to the indices were made

available for review by

appropriately cleared SSC Staff Members at FBI Headquarters!

This briefing was held in the conference room of

the INTD, JEH Building, on 8/28/75 during the approximate

period 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.

Present at this meeting were

Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Section Chief J. G. Deegan,

Unit Chief E. P. Grigalus, SA K. A. Mendenhall, all of the

INTD, Mark Gitenstein, Michael Epstein, and Martha Talley,

Staff Members of the SSC.

Main items of discussion during this briefing

no 2225235793

centered around the Rabble Rouser Index (RRI), later known as

the Agitator Index (AI),

the Key Activist program (KAP), the

Security Index (sI), and the Administrative

origin and implementation of the abovê-mentioned indices ande

the KAP were discussed

and Mr. Wannall offered background

information and historical reasoning as to the necessity for

and the KAP.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE :

Senstudy 75

62-116395

were advised there is no plan of action in the FBI for the

apprehension of the individuals so listed. The SSC Staff

Members were advised individuals currently listed on the

ADEX would merely be afforded priority investigative attention

during any

national emergency which should occur; however,

SSC Staff Members also

indicated they telt criteria for inclusion on the ADEX

when first established were the same as the criteria for

inclusion on the old SI. They were advised when the ADEX

Program was initiated the criteria were basically the same;

however, after closely following the matter for a period

of approximately 8 months, the criteria were reevaluated

and revised so only individuals who were considered

currently dangerous were to be included on the ADEX.

SSC Staft Members

were also advised that the sI was

stored "off-line" in the Bureau's computers and as such

was utilized in a strictly in-house operation. Informa-

tion was therefore not available to outside agencies or

terminals tied in with the Bureau's computer system.

Staff Members also indicated from a review of material

made available to them it appeared as though there was

friction between the Bureau and the Department during the

late 1940s and early 1950s with respect to establishing

guidelines and policy in connection with the SI and they

desired to know what

the cause of this friction was. INTD

representatives present advised they were unaware of the

cause of any such friction.

Other questions similar to those above were asked

present. In addition the following nine questions were asked

SSC Staff Members and Mx. Wannall indicated answers

would be obtained and orally furnished:

1. Was there a memorandum which established the

RRI and does it indicate MI. Hoover appeared berore the

Civil Unrest Commission? (A memorandum dated 8/ 3/67 from

C. D. Brennan to vr. W. C. Sullivan indicates Mr. Hoover

instructed an index be compiled ot racial agitators; however,

the memorandum does not indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before

the Civil Unrest Commission.)

Memorandum to Mr.

Re :

Senstudy 75

62-116395

R. Wannall

Was there a memorandum concerning the

expansion of the AI to include individuals of local

prominence? (Memorandum of G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C.

Sullivan dated 11/22/67 requested approval of an SAC

letter for expanding the AI to include local leaders as

well as national leaders involved in racial disorders.)

3.

Were individuals included on both the AI and

the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?

(Individuals were

included on both the AI and the SI;

nowever, this was not necessarily a duplication of effort

inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized

in the apprehension

and detention of individuals considered dangerous and the

AI was an administrative aid to follow the activities and

movement of individuals attempting to cause racial

disorders.)

4. When did the SI become automated and was the

Reserve Index (RI) ever automated? (The SI became automated

during the early 1950s and was updated throughout the years

with the advancement of computer technology and purchase

by the Bureau of more advanced computers.

Following

discontinuance of the SI the ADEX was continued in the

computer systems in an "off-line" manner. The RI-A-

was placed on automatic data processing (ADP) equipment

the same as the SI. RI-B was maintained at the field

level only and was never placed in the ADP equipment.)

5. Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's

portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)

been returned?

(One copy of the Attorney General's

portfolio concerning the EDP has been located and is

currently maintained in the Security Informant Unit of

the IS-2 Section, INTD.)

6. Who were the Bureau individuals who

(a) maintained the Attorney General's portfolio during

1968 and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?

(The following individuals were identified through

review of pertinent communications during time period

in question: (a) 1968 - C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow,

(2) 1966-5.

T. P. Rosack; (b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J. C. Strickland;

1948-Lish Whitson, W. H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

Memorandum to Mr.

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

7. When did the Department start reviewing and

approving the sI list?

Matters pertaining to the old

Custodial Detention List were first referred to the

Department during March, 1941. Copies of the SI were

submitted to the Department during 1951 and the Department,

on a continuing basis, reviewed matters pertaining to the

SI except for brief periods of time when funds and manpower

were not available until the SI was discontinued in 1971.)

8. Was there a form used by the Department

concerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals

on the SI and, if so, what does the form look like?

(Forms were utilized

and copies have been obtained to

exhibit to SSC Staff Members.)

9. Do we have a copy of the form for including

or deleting an individual fxom the AI? (FD-397 was

utilized with the AI. A copy of this form will be

exhibited to SSC Staff Members.)

At the closure of this briefing SSC Staff Members

expressed their appreciation to the Bureau personnel present

and indicated the briefing had furnished them a better

understanding of the Bureau's utilization of the above

indices and the KAP.

ACTION:

With your approval and in accordance with your

revious instructions the Senstudy Unit will initiate contac

ith Mr. Gitenstein so answers relating to the above nin

questions may be orally provided to the above-named SSC

Staff Members.

On 8/22/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director foror S'y-

the Domestic Intelligence Task Force of the Senate Select Com-

mittee, advised that regarding proposed plans Ior testimony

Dy bureau officials before the Senate Select Committee that

the Committee tentatively scheduled hearings for mid-October.

He cited October 16th as

being the approximate date.

Iní-

tially, according to Elliff,

hearings concerning the. Bureau

were to have been initiated in the first week of October but

the Staff Members did not have the necessary background in-

formation to conduct the hearings at that time and instead

scheduled hearings concerning IRS for early October.

Elliff indicated that the tentative format for

these hearings would be to furnish the Bureau an outline of

or a series of questions pertaining to the area to be covered

in testimony prior to our appearance. He indicated that the

hearings would cover a narrow topic on any given day so that

a Bureau official could be briefed and respond to questions

raised concerning the particular subject matter.

Elliff indicated that typical subjects of hearings

concerning the FBI would be a one-day hearing on political

abuse or

series of hearings on COINEd 9: 02116315-774

Elliff indicated that it was the Committee's intent

to continue hearings regarding the FBI into mid-December once

they are initiated with the Bureau testifying at least once

a week during that period. He advised they also envisioned

the initial hearing as setting forth what the scope of the

Senate Select Committee inquiry had been into the FBI and of

topics to be covered by hearings.

Elliff felt this would

inform the House Select Committee of what areas the Senate

Select Committee had delved into.

It is the Committee's intention to insert in some of the

blanks in the documents an identifying description of IRS

personnel who assisted the FBI in' certain instances, such

as

"an IRS Special Agent" or "an IRS Inspector".

We will

make these identifications based upon our notes from the

documents, and will supply you with copies of the documents

In which such descriptions have been typed in order that

you may check the accuracy of the descriptions. In this

way, we will avoid public identification of the IRS per-

sonnel even though Bureau agreement has previously been

obtained that these individuals are not "sources"

Reference is made to letter dated September 19, 1975,

from Senator Frank Church, Chairman, SSG, to Mr. Paul V. Daly,

Office of Legal Counsel, FBI. This commnication enclosed

a list of documents which the SSC may decide to declassify

for public hearings on the Huston Plan. The FBI was requested

to advise whether any of the documents required appropriate

excisions prior to the declassification.

On September 21, 1975, Messrs. William 0. Gregar

and Elmer W. Larson of the FBI met with Hir. John Elliff of the

SSC Staft.

During this meeting, the documents, which were

enclosed with the September 19, 1975, letter, were carefully

reviewed and excisions were made and mutually agreed to.

This is to advise that the FBI has no objection

to the declassification and use of the documents for public

hearings providing the excisions mutually agreed to on

September 21, 1975, are in effect.

Dear Mike:

The following two documents, which relate to the Martin

: request for documents:

A. Airtel dated 2/12/62 from SAC, New York, to

B. Airtel dated 8/15/66 from SAC, New York, to

Director, FBI, subject "Communist Party, USA,

- C (Stanley David Levison)."

These two documents had been previously provided to the

Virtually the entire contents of Item A. (a 3-page airtel)

were excised because "it could result in identification of an

FBI informant," and more than 12 pages of Item B. la 29-page.

airtel) were excised because such portions contained information

which

"tends to identify highly sensitive sources of continuing

value." A third document which is needed by the Committee, and

which would presumably also be provided by the Bureau only in

excised form is a New York field office letter to the Bureau

dated 6/21/62 as cited in the last paragraph of page 2 of the

10/11/62 memorandum from the SAC, Atlanta,

to the Diresto,

FBI, subject "Communist Infiltration of the sougern chra

The Bureau's

position with respect to the excised portions

of Items A. and B. above was reiterated by FBI representatives

at our September 9 meeting, notwithstanding our position that

these materials were deemed to be absolutely essential to our

complete understanding of the King investigation.

As you are

aware, several other documents previously providea to the

Committee contain conclusionary statements about Stanley Levison

as predicates for many of the actions taken with respect to

King, and it would appear that the withheld portions of

Items A. and B. above, as well as the 6/21/62 New York letter

described above, would contain the detailed bases for such

conclusions.

I am sure you would agree that the underlying facts

concerning Levison are vital in order that we can meet our

responsibilities to fully assess the propriety of the FBI's

activities with respect to this case. Accordingly, I would

appreciate your personal attention to this matter, including

your own examination of the three documents in question, and

hopefully, a determination by you that these documents should

be provided to the Committee in unexcised form (except for the

names of so-called "live" informants) .

An early resolution of this matter is essential, and I

would hope you can respond by the end of the week.

Sincerely,

Chu Elaft
