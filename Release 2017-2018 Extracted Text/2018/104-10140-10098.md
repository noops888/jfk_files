8. (Confidential - GLC) LIAISON I called Bob Blakey, Chief
Counsel, House Select Committec oeimansainations, to advise him of a
call I had received from a former Committee employee who was calling
on behalf of a current employee who is concerned about action taken
regarding security clearances, (See Memorandum for the Record.)

9. (Secret - GLC) LIAISON Mr, Blake, A/DDCI, called to
advise me that we might expect a call from Jerry Schecter, NSC staff,
asking us to set up a meefing with Chairman Daniel K, Inouye (D,, Hawaii)
and Chairman Edward Boland (D., Mass.) for the DCI, Assistant Secretary
of Defense Duncan and Ambassador Frank Press to brief the two Chairmen
on the President's decision on telecommunications as contained in PRM-22.

10. (Internal Use Only ~ GLC) LIAISON Received a call from
Dick Fischer, Standard Oil Company of Indiana, indicating that the Director
had attended a lunch on his recent visit to Chicago which was attended by
Al Monk, a Standard Oil representative who spoke with Bob Hepworth,
NFAC/CSS and myself sometime ago about access to intelligence information.
Fischer said he just wanted to alert me to the fact of the Director's meeting
with Monk in the event the Director brings the matter up with us. I thanked
Fischer for his call and told him that if there are any significant developments
on this from this end, I would be in touch with him,
