Apaticio comuents:. Then there's "date" -- "engagenent" is used in

Albert says to leave that and start working on something more importent.
Aparicio dictates to Rojas:

Aparicio continues dictating to Rojas: ...

"Conpafiero" Editor -- I acknowledge your kind note No. 83,
of Harch 23rd last, inforaing that you have not received
the magazine "Siempre", at the Casa de las Americas,

which had a subscriptton and the remittance of which
magazine was taken care of by Compafiera Teresa Proenza.

In this connection I transcribe below reply frou Compafiero
Raul Aparicio, Cultural Advisor: weeetho Zagagine "Siempre"
vag elvays remitted to Compafiera Marta "Tzeta" (way it sounded)
by Spita., Neus Expresotti (or something lika that) of the._
Publishing House “Erano" (way it sounded) but she stopped
sending it in view that the books they sold to Cuba havo
never been paidy in spite of the fact that they accepted
payment in Cuban currency which did not involve any exchange
charges, This coincided with the discharge of Hiss Proenza
from her job.

Some man interrupts Aparicio'a dictation and tells Aparicio peed |
abovt theatrical activities which vere carried on in Cuban before 1961,

and that afterwards they did not do anything nore. Aparicio remarks that
they sxst have had a premonttion of what was coning...(evidently refer-

ring to Comsunism). Hoar laughter. (They keep talking but in lower voice
and cannot understand).

Man is heard remarking: This already was the participation of the 0.6.

Alberu interrupts and asks Aparicig about some film which is
going to be shown and vhether he can come to the Enbassy ot

Aparicio continues dictation:

Oh no, the minimum for any play ts about one month..
otherwise it's not worth prosenting {t,

The cther point is, in what theatre?

There are two fundamental theatres for such reprosonta-

As the Seguro Soctal has a certain general way of behavior,

T doubt if they would be willifg...

Because it is "Coquet" (sounded like it) -(Coquet is the
Director General of tho Seguro Social

Apariaio asks Rojas what does it mean in Mexico when they say
“escuincle". Rojas explains the the word was usod by the Mexicans
before the Spaniards came to conquer Mexico, as the nama for a special
breed of dogs which they use to eat, and then later the people started
to call smsli children “escuincle" (equivalent to our calling them
"brats". Then Rojaa goes on to explain that in Monterrey and other
parts of northern Mexico they call small children "nuercos".
