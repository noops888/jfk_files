reiayed to Fl/Livision D, regarding lossible Access to the Recordings
Alleged to Have Been tiade of the Speech at the Latin American Youth
Congress om 4 Auguat 1966 in ifavana by Bernon Ferguson SITCHELL.

Reference: CS~-3/450,465, disseminated on 21 September 1960. i

1, Keferenced report, based on HZP-3852 cated 23 August i960, wae
disseminated on 21 Septembsr 1960 as Ci-3/456, 465 to various U.S. Agencies,
including NSA. Separately illen M. Hanna of the Panama Station prepared
a dispatch forwarded as HZ PA-10437 under date of 14 September 1560, referencing
above report and calling attention to the fact that MITCHLLi had been reported
present at the LAYG Mee’ing according to disseminated report, HZPA-10437
was routed to various WH Livision Leake, none of which broasht the contents
to the aftention of appropriate \.H Division officials who might have been expected
to have had sure knowlede of or reaponsinility for follow-ap of such information,
and latter dispatch, therefore did not ch this office until 7 Uc le
through the good affices of eran flee Mex. as the
individual who noted on the cov. Livision, when phons,
had advised that no attempt had been uads to follow-up this lead or to determine
who in the Agency might have responsibility for reporting such information directly

to NSA or other U.S. Government agencies,

2. (Ca or about 28 September 1960, tr. Be D. Noell of O/S/SRS received
a a telephone call from NSA officials, calling his attention to the existence of a
report CS-3/450, 465 of 21 September 1960, which indicated that CLA hud either
had an observer or had contact with someone who had attencd the LAYG, which
individual had reported per refermnce that ternog i’, MITCH: LL had made a
speech in Havana on 4 August 1960 which specch “had been recorded”. Ergo,

|. NSA was most anos to ootain elther the originale or a copy of the “tapes” :

or “recoré" mentioaed in the report, im order that persone familiar with MITCHZLL .
and his manner of speaking mizht listen to same to check the identification

made in referenced report. ir. Noell relayed this request to the writer immediate
ly upon recelt, whereupon within the space of two days or so, the writer in tura
checked with the Cfifice of Chief, WH/ Uperations, Mr. J. ~sterline, who in turm
referred the writer to the Panamanian Desk, / fter a succession of referrals,

the writer ended up talking witi a young Laay in ranama Reports Section, whose same



unfortunately escape me at this ime. Notes made at the time of this
Conversation nave either been mislaid or temporarily lost, and therefore

are not available for referral at this writing. After several minutes of discussion |
back and forth with reference to the report itself, attempts to locate emact passage,

ete. the writer finally arrived at a point where the request for acceés to the
"recording" mentioned by NSA officials could be relayed to the Fanama Desk

Referenced Report actually said, was intended to say, etc., how the information

was probably obtained, and finally a virtual refutztion of the statement that the

gratuitously that "if e recording actually w:

made, undoubtedly this was ander~

taken by the Cuban authorities theinselves as tne hosts for the meeting..... and
therefore would be in Havana in the hands of the Castro authorities, and not in

the possession of CLA either in the field or at Headquarter:

ree Ake ae

potest

6fficer, Reaction received amounted to a re-interpolation of what Para 3,k, of
“gpeech was recorded" aa reported in ciasemination, I was thereupon advised

that above statement was mere assum tion on her part, obviously was not based
on any factual information she had first-hand or had ceveloped through research
into other papeze available on this conference, wherefore CLA could not relay

such a reply to NSA, Additional argument engued, ard the Panama Desk officer
recollected that "someone eise recently mentioned tapes brought up either from
Cuba or Panama which someone had been looking for, out in a different connection.
She was thereupon requested by the writer to check into such separate inquiry,

and advise the writer of the results. Another telephone call within about 24 hours
resuited in agreemeni vy Fansma Reports Section either to initiate necessary
pouch themselves, or else to take.up with the appropriate Operations Desk Officer

the initiation of a formal inquiry to Panama Station, by pouch, the entire matter
of existence of a tape or record-platter of the speech reported in reference,

availability of such "recording" at-or to the Station or the Agent who had brought
in the original report, and request that if available, such recording be forwarded

with whom I had talked had accepted this request as official, and that I had received

a firm commitment that appropriate correspondence would be initiated to cover

this point, allowing for “crash priorities" which might develop unexpectedly, 80

that.a reply could bs expected by late October or early November. I reiterated
insietance by this office that without regard to any knowledge possessed by Hqs.
Desk Officers of the circumstances of the reported LAYG meeting, at least a
pro-forma written query to the field was required on basis of the NSA requeet

that they be allowed to listed to the reported "recording"

in order that a factual

answer could be given their inquiry and the disseminated report be clarified in
event the wording used therein had led to erroneous conclusions an part of the

cra recipient.

3. At the time of these discussions the writer gained the impression that
i a relatively irge amount of confusion reigned in the Cuban and Ranamanian Desks

of WH Division, based upon crash-priorities resulting from the U.N, meeting .
in New York, Mr. Castro's antics in New York, absence of various responsible

desk officers on other business, wherefore there might be some delay in getting
the actual pouch written and out to the Leld, Mention also was made of « large
4moont of material recentiy sent back to Headquarters from the field in conection
with the LAYG and from the Panama Station, which would also have to be checked
prior to preparation of the outgoing dispatch, etc. However, the writer was assured
that we would be kept advised of the progress made and specifically would be
imexediately alerted, when field reply on this point was received.

4. Above information was relayed to sir. Noell upon completion if these
arrangements, and he in tarn advised NSA that we were checking with our field
representatives in an effort to locate the actual recordings, tape or platter as the
case might be, to which they desired access.

5. As of this morning writer was advised by Mr. Noell that NSA had

again inquired of him last week, and again this week the status af oar efforts to

locate the requested recording of the MITCHELL speech on 4 Aagust 1960, ae they

still desired to listen to the voice to verify the identification of the speaker ag

actually the former NSA employee, Sermon F. MITCHELL, as reported in reference.

‘The writer thereapon retraced the ertire performance, as related in paras 2 and 3,

only to discover anew that no-one had the faintest inkling,of what I was talxing about,

nor could anyone recollect that any reqvest had been made by this office or the

writer with reference to CS-3/450, 465, para. 3,k. After initlally calling mr.

ESTERLINE's secretary on this problem, the writer was referred by her

to Mr. Phillips, who apparently is head of the Fanama Desk. After a ‘Jolly

chat well into the subject, Mr. Phillips, who had Hstened politely for a brief tim,

asked whether the writer realized that he knew nothing about the whole affair, and
rily responsible for PP activities. He suggested I call a Mr.

a Ext, 2031, who suggested that I might have been talking at ime
or original query with Mise Barbara cdmuni s, Reports Officer, or ‘the other girl
who works in thet ame office". However, wr got down to specifics right
away. Alter obtaining the necessary coples of both the disseminated report and the
HSPA-10437 dispatch referencing same, he agreed that there was some urgency in

" getting a definitive report from the field as to whether or not a “recording” had
been made of the speech itself, who made it, who heldit, and whether or not the
original or a copy thereof could be obtained on a priority basis by Havana Station
and forwarded to Headquarters for the purposes requested by NSA. He thereapon
suggested that he could send oat a routine cable to the field, text of which he :
virtually read to me over the phone, and asked whether in the interests of expediting
8 same I could coordinate {t for FI/D by phone in draft-form, which I did,
He was advised that the indicater "ZRGRAC. should be included in the heading,
and we shall: therefore receive a copy of the cable when it fe finally sent out. we
will «160, obviously be included on the reply or replies {ron both Haysna and
Panama City, when available. 1 gained the impression that Mr,|
reasonably impressed by the urgency of getting a straight-forward answer alter
much anneceasary delay, and the spot we were now in vinea-vis NSA's original
request oi over a conth ago. 1am certain that we aball not get any run-around from

6 242. Noell was advised by phone this morning of the iatest developments.

Mr. Noell advised that since the most recent query on this amtter came ‘rom

Jerry Brastow, Deputy to i Grooms, he was of the dpi-uon that this wae merely
a fobbw-up of some loose-ends concerning which sor.eone on General Carroll's

etaff may have made inquiry to Brastow, in connecsion with the Carroll Investig:

tion of this case. Gennral Carroll's sta‘f, apparcntly, keep digging up such litte
unfinished pleces of business, and reminding va.ious people at NSA, probably
on a “tickler system baie" that such and such a lead has not been checked out in

its entirety, anc that status of such r
that in light of his original report to }

wests should be checked. Ar. Noell advised
that CLA was working on attemfte to iccete

the “recordings” elther in the field or at headquarters, he would make no further

7. So far the situation seems to be under control once again. It is most
enfortunate that sach unnecessary delay in complying with the original request
was caused by a variety of factors ubich in distilled fashion can be termed
“lack of cooperation” by WH/Panama Cesk officers with whom the original
request was discussed. it is also unfortunate that {rom the outset, namely
receipt of HZi--3652, thia entire matter has been given obviously reatine

treatment by people vno either iack the initiative to check on sho might heave

responsibility within C1, for follow-up of this type of case, or who were not
sufficiently “ag courant" with the overt news to recognize the name Bernon
F. Mitchell, Iam not certain that you wish to take thia matter any further,

uniess there sre reasons af which | am anaware, Biy own impression is that
perbapa the best thing would be to let the whole matter drop for the moment,

at least until each time as we can again r:
