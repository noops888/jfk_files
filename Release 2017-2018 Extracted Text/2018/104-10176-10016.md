had advised thai no attempt had been tade to follow ap this lead or to determine

who in the Agency might have responsiblity for reporting such information directly

to NSA of other U.S. Goverument agencles.

8o Ca or abou: 28 September 1960, MI. J. Do Noell of 015/SRS received

« telephone call from NSA ollicials, calling his attention to the existence of a

report CS-3/450,465 o1 of septenber septenber which which indicated that CLA had either

lund an observer or had contact with sompose who had attended the LAYG, walch

Individual had reported per referance that sernon t MlTCH.IL bad made a

speech in Harana on & August 1960 which speoch "had been recorded"- Esgo..

NSA was most andoss to obtain either the origianla or a copy al the "raped"

or "record" mentioned is the report, la order that persons famillar with MItcHe

and his mnnnes of speaking might linsen to same to check the identification

made in referenced reports li?. Noell relayed this request to sae writer immediasa-

ly upon receipe, whereupon wilhis the space of two jays or no, the wrltor la tura

checked with the Cilice of Chief, HHI perallons, Air. Jo interline, who la tura

reforred the writer to the Panamanian Lenk, /fir a succession of referrals,

unfortunately escape me at thia time. Notes made at the dime of this

conversation save either been mislaid or temporarily lost, and therefore

are not avallable for referral at this vriting. Aíter several minutea of discassion

back and forth with reference to the report itsell, attempts to licate enact passage,

etc, the writer finally arrived at a point were the request for access to tbe

"recording" mentioned by NSA officials could be relayed to the Fanama Desk

officer. Reaction received amounted to a re-interpolation of what Para 3, 1, Of

Referenced Report actually said, was intended to say, elc., how the informa don

was prokably obtained, and finally a virtual refutztion of the statement inat the

"speech was recorded" an reported in cissemination. I was thereupon advised

gratuitously that "1l a recording actually was made, undoubtedly this was under-

taken by the Cuban authorided thernaelted as le hosts for the meeting.... and

therefore would be in Havana in the hands of the Cosiro authorities, and not in

the possession of CLA either in the field or al Headguarters." A few more rounde

that above statement was mere assumption on her part, obvioudly was not ased

on any factual informadon she had dirst-hand or had ceveloped through research

into other pape=s available on this conierence, wherefore CLA could not relay

such a reply to NSA.

Additional argument ensued, ard the Panama Deak officer

recollected that "someone eise recently mentioned tapes brought up eitber from

Cuba or Panama which someone had been looking for, out in a different connection. •"

She was thereupon requested by the writer to chech into such separate inguiry,

ald advise the writer of the results: Another telephone call within about 24 hours

resuited in agreemeni by Fanama Reporis Section either to initiate necessary feid

pouch therselves, or else to lake up with the appropriate Operationa Dest Officer

the initiation of a formal inquiry to Panama Station, by pouch, the entire matter

of existence of a tape or record-platter of the speech reported in reference.

avallability of such "secording" at or to the Station or le Agent who had arougat

in the original report, and request that if available, such

•recording be forwarded

to Headquarters soonest.

I was under the impresdos s. the time that the party

with whom I had talked had accepted this request as official, and that I had received

« firm commitment that appropriate correspondence would be initiated to cover

thia point, allowing for "crash priorities" which might develop unexpecgaly so

that a reply could be expected by late October or eazly November. I reiterated

Insistance by this office that without regard to any knowledge possessed by Hga.

Demi. Officers of the circumstances of the reported LAYE meeting, at least a

pro-forma wiltten query to the field vas required on basis of the NSA requert

that they be allowed lo listed to the reported "recording", in order that a factuml

annwer could be given their inquiry and the dinseminated report be claritied in

event the wording uned the rein had led to erroneous conclusiona on part of tie

recipient.

3. At the time of the se discunniona the writer gainad the impresaion that

a relatively lage amount of confusion reigned in the Cuban and Paramanian Deake

of WH Division, based upon cranh-priorities resuldng from the U.N. meeting .

desis officers on other business, wherefore there might be some delay in getting

the actual pouch written and out to the neid. Mention also vas made of a large

amoons of material recentiy sent back to Headquarters from the field la connection

with the LAYC and from the Panama Station, which would also have to be checited

prior to preparation dl the outgoing dispatch, elt. however, the writer val assared

that we would be kept advised a the progress made and spechically would be

incediately alerted, wben field reply on this point was received.

4 Above information was relayed to sir. Noell upon completion d these

arrangements, and be in tarn advined NSA that we were checking with our field

representatives in an effort to locate the actual recordings, lape or platter as the

case might be, to which they desired access.

5. As of this morring writer was advised by Mr. Noell that NSA bad

again inquired of him last weet, and again this weez the status of our efforts la

locate the requested recording of the NIICHELL speech on & jagust 1966, as thay

atill jesired to listen to the voice to verify the identification of the speaker as

actually lbe former NSA employee, Bernon f• MITCHELL, as reported in relerence.

The writer thereupon retraced the ertire performance, as related in paras 2 and 3,

only to discover anew that no-one had the faintest inkling.of what I sas talicing about.

nor could anyone recolleet that any request bad been made by this afice or the

writer with reference to CS-31450, 465 para. 3 1. After initially calling Mi.

ESTERLINE's secretary on this problera, the writer was refer-ed by her

He suggested I call a dr.

HSPA-10437 dispatch referencing same.

he agreed that there was some urgency is

getting a definitive report from the field as to whether or not a "recording" had

been made of the mpeech itsell, who made it, who held it, and whether or not the

origiond or a copy thereof could be obtained on a priority basis by Havan Station

and forwarded to Headquartera for the purposes requented by NSA. He thereupon

suggested that he could send out a routine cable to the field, text as ubich be

virtoally read to me over the phone, and anted whether in the interests of expediding

• name I could coordinate it for FI/D by phone in draft-lorm, which I did.

He was adviied that the indicates "ZRGRACE" abould be included in the heading.

6. Mr. Noell was advised by phone this morning of the incest developenta.

MI. Noell adriaed thal since the most recent query on thie mtter came ¿romo

Jerry Brantow, Leputy 1o di Groms, he was of the bp-son that this was merely

a fobbw-up of some loose-ends concerning which sor.sone on General Carroll's

staff may have made loquiry to brastow, in conneciion with the Carroll laventiga

tion of this case. General Carroll's stail, apparently, keep digging up such little

unfleished pleces al buiness, and reminding vaiious people at lisa, probably

On s"'tickler ayorem basis" that such and such a lead bas not been checked out la

its entirety, and that status d such requests should be checked. Air. Noell advised

that in light of his original report to NiA tial ClA was norking on atteraßta to lscare

the "recording»" elther in the field or at headquarters, he woulá make no further

froto the field.

%. So far the ritualion seems to be under control once again. It is most

mortunate that such unnecessary delay in complying with the original requess

mas caused by a rariety of factors which in distilled fashion can be termed

"'lach of cooperation" by HH/Parama Lent officers with whore the original

request was discused. " is also unfortunate that from the outset, namely

receipt of HZI -3652, this estire matter has been given obviousiy reatine

treatment by people uno eimer inch ine inlinlive to chech on van right here

responsibility witha ChA for lollow-up ol this sype aí case, or to were not

sufficiently "as courant' with the overt news to recognize the name Bernon

F. dischell. I am not certain lhas you wish to take this master any furtber.

miea? there are reasons of which I am unaware. May own lopression is that

perhapa the best thing rould be to let she whole matter drop for the moment.

at least until noch time as we can again raise ile say by sest Tuesday or 80.

La event we do not have a reply to dir.
