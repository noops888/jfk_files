PHASE I (CLA)

ACTIVITY

INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

1. * Dispatch one intelligence

agent operation to key area

selected by ClA.

PURPOSE

CONSIDERATIONS

Collect and report intelligence on anti-

regime attitudee, on potential resist.

ance, and on vulnerabilities and

strengths of Communist security

system.

intelligence

stall officers in place in

Havana,

To collect intelligence.

There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.

intelligence activity within Cuba.

Selected personnel

are being intensively trained.

This firet team has 2

agents. An area in which resistance has been reported

has been selected.

Agent operations must stay alive,

make useful contacts, and report securely to CIA.

Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack

of intelligence. First reports from first team are

expected by the end of March, while reporta from the

second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex-

pected to start in April.

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained

for paramilitary skille as well as intelligence collection,

with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba

and ready to act whenever paramilitary operatione are

decided upon. However,. ClA has noted that, once the

agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled

effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort

will be made to attempt such control.

These stall intelligence officere may also be used in the

future for communications or agent handling, if lulure

developments warrant.

and to provide security against Com-

munist agent operatione.

5. it

..Periodic intelligence esti

mates, ad required by progress

of operations.

To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current

estimates can be considered at national

policy levels.

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendation

as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at

utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with

a new building completed and occupied,

and with a

staff of 43 al work.

Operationa commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.

(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State, USIA.)

As the operations develop, there will be both increased

intelligence collection and a need for as current an In

telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully.

It is likely that a more informal method of producing an

Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than

now governing the issuance of NIE's) mày have to be

To collect intelligence in a Latin

atmosphere, at different levele thai

now seem possible in the continental

U.S., to spot additional intelligence

assete and to provide security

against Communiat agent operatione.

Ellectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose

of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions

controlling these factors.

If the recruitment and train-

ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-

ment and training will be much less difficult than if

they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes

only.

There are "colonies in Washington, D.C., and other

U.S. cities which are "little Cubas," Family, Church,

PURPOSE

To overtly engage the U.S. prestige in aup.

port of a Cuban revolt to an extent that would

require the U.S, to become involved in aBsur

ing the ultimate victory of a Cuban revolution;

thie involvement must include the commitment

of U.S. military forces as necessary to achieve

such victory.

Indicate policy and commit prestige of U.S.

government to appropriate support of the

tion of the legal and moral factors, assessed

in the perspective of world opinion and U. S.

accurity interests.

ers in Cuba who have been

in accordance with contingency

plans.

PURPOSE

To assure that Cuban "[reedom-lighters"

are fully equipped to attack the Commun

ist regime' a military and police forces;

as part of the assurance, the U.S. support

must include the immediate commitment

of U.S. leadership personnel in combat

operations.

To intervene as required to achieve victory

for the revolutionary forces.

CONSIDERATIONS

DOD support planning, stock piling, readying o

equipment and personnel for commitment must

be developed with maximum lead time.

Close

coordination with ClA is required to insure maxi

mum readiness to meet the immediate needa of

the revolutionary forces.

The hazard of visibility

in preparing for these support activities makes

security a paramount consideration.

Consistent with security aspect, U.S. milit

forces are placed in a state of readinese to

accomplish the assigned mission.

The military

forces must be prepared to assiat in the mainte

nance of order until the revolutionary government

is in control.

established after the April 196l failure in Cuba.

CONSIDERATIONS

These activities will have some negative impact

on the Cuban people, who are part of the largel, but

are consistent with an overt policy of isolating Castro

and neutralizing his influence in the Western Hemis-

phere.

PURPOSE

To develop increased "hard" intelligence.

To add to the U.S. intelligence coverage

on Cuba and possibly to atrengthen the

concern of Latin American states for

security.

To ensure optimum implementation of the

intelligence plan.

To overthrow the Communist government

of Cuba.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

CONSIDERATIONS

Use of cays near Cuba entail unacceptable security

riska when vulnerable to Cuban landing parties.

(Defense, in collaboration with CLA.)

Sensitivity of using this multi-national organiza-

tion clearly restricts potential use by USA.

Visi

bility of operational interest is an acceptable risk

here.

The intelligence plan requires support by U.S.

military manpower and equipment.

The U.S, military intervention inust be conducted

as quickly as possible and with sufficient force

so that the Communist Bloc's ability to take

effective counter measures is reduced to a

minimum.
