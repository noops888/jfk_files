af Frelininiry assessment:

ahe reported in tho following vara-
eraphs havebecn zystenatized 20 9% to be rendabdlo. actual-
ly,the initial debvier. conducted under academe cover
showed already that interviewing and laterronatins xgaiiore.
is a rather disvicult tisk. Sinco he is at tines an alnost
coanitisive tulker and indulses in lon parcnthetical re-
marks and soeculative co:entc,it is almost inpossiblo
to keop him on a steedy course. iie ia an intelligent
and observant youns mn but does not seen to be canable
of sustained concentration. He wants to show that he is
a@ bright and alort man,that he grasps all inovlications
quickly,and he wants to imprezs ond please. .ils intellec-
tual ambitions are preater than his actual caoabilities.
lie wants to be"ynderstood"and hence becomes often a
long-winded "explainer". “ie sees himself in a far more
flattering lisht than other people see hin and because
he is vanuely aware of ti:is,he becones overzealous and
vorbase. io dees not produce.a favorable inpression at
the first a@ance;his aypearanee is not oncaging;his
small end weak nands are outright reputsive. rrobably
due to Ais ba vound /Jevish lover niddle-class/, he
seers to havo developed ccrtain inferiority feelings
and resentments. se has acquired sone political pre=
judices which are feé¢ more by cmotion than by reason.

“Se ig quite likely to deceive himselr into believing

that what he imows and weat he has experienced hes a
general validity and he is therefore inclined to evade
self-analysis and self-criticiem., ~e is sometines
arrozant and overly colf-assurcd,sometinzes quite self~
conscious and timigd.

When xeney switched fron acadenic
cover to the role of an ..IS revresentative, swe dis~
played-a pronounced sucoiciousness,anxicty,fear and
a whole nacwt of reelincs which all indicate that he
is not a very stron vercsonality. <ven thouzh he pro~

the soviet nbassy in Corenhagon to ask for another vini-
tor’s visa vor a longer stay vith his rolatives in sunnor

about 9 months,he thouzht that he should start early,
Though he had not been favorabdly impressed by the con=
ditions in the USsR,he ruated to return for a longer
stay to study the languace which,as ho figured, he i
would Inow better in a year fron the tine of his appli-

to recuest another stay in tho USSR. At this visit Sub-

passport himself. At the same ocersion,when he gave
back the nassvort to subject,he inverted 360 Danish
ervons into the pansnort,but Subject returned the
money. as to tho destruction of -the passport ,subject
said to NMARYACHKOV that he would think it over,but

2/ Subject claims to have no preciso recollec-
tion about two other meetings during sumuer 1960,one
of which could havo taken place anvrox.Auguat 1960.

At those meetings GEONGIY asked amain if Subject had
conmlied with his request for a vrittea statemont,if
ho had been at the Embassy,if he had become acquainted
with anyone fron the Danish nersonnel ‘of the American

-Babassy. In the meantine, Subject had revealed to his

mother his involvements ~ late swxrier 1960 - and the
latter had inploreé hin not to continue his contacts
and not speak with anybody anymore, inxsubjoct was
therciore even nore reluctant thun before and pro-
JuxS1Y at either neeting.
Subject moved to his present address
and heard nothing from GrunGIY. In the bexinning of
January. 1961 subject received a letter rroa his uncle
in ..insk,who asked hin ir Subject could visit him again,
allecedly,subdject felt that since he was soing back to
the inited states in septenber,anotner onvoxtunity to

and cultivated by 3A V, he allevsdly " smelled che-se",

explanation Por what hannened next in Cooeaharen,wken

: V obviously teok on a clan-
destine character. rhe only more or less acceptable

theory adxuenced by Subjeet is that since he wanted to
visit his uncle again,he did not want to lose his
“connection” with KESYACIIKCY gad the latter's assistance
for his vica matters. Subject’s account of his contacts
with SAZOUOV and KAHN and his -allesed refusal to accept
the recruitment sound rairly plausible and consistent
with 318 nethods,but we have only subject’s om word

for: it, It is clear,however,that he did not revéal the
recruitnent attenvt to anyone at that time and hence

it can be well essuned that he was nledged to secrecy =
and for a longs time complied with this pledge. In the
linht of Subject*s ovm account,his further contacts

With KRARYACHNOV end later on with GECRGIY in Covonhacen
from Xovenber 1939 to sebruary 1961 are more than fa-
plaugible. if he was so disrusted ani go unvillins to

elicit some duta fron his relatives. an epprepriate
VBe2 vriefin, would be necessary nnd,as stated
above,a Flevéewzy exirination prior to any assign-

mont.

b/ CE valne : “heoretically speaking, Subject
is ina fairly good good nosition to become a double arent,
but he does.not appear to be a nerson who is capable
of cerrying this role off in a sustained manner. His
current contact with the «IS represontatives in Conen-
hagen is,i1 we accept subject’s rccount,ceni-dormant,
but can ho revived with little orfort. whis seems to
be the imiediatoly nost productive line of continuing
tho iwme caso during subject’s stay in Cononhagen.

If Subject should obtein a third visa,it is quite
likely that G:CXGIY will attach seme strings to it
and it is not impossible that oubject will be subjoctcd
to another recruitment attempt in icinsk,osvecially
since he is niannins to return to the USA in Septenber.
fhe RIS hes been in touch with subject vor aore than
three years,has exposed to hin three representatives

not writton orf subject es a honeless ense. It is
therefore reco:rzenéeti that the gyuiti2 case be conti~
nued alonz these lines with oO yrriaeds exaaination
