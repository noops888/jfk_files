Dear

As you might surmise, your organization is well

known to the Agency. Following the receipt of your

letter of 31 March 1976, a more definitive search for

information pertaining to your request was conducted.

No information was located which would indicate that

CIA has ever provided funds

either directly

or indirectly. I trust this letter will allay any

apprehensions your organization has had in this

matter.

If I. can be of further assistance, do not

I have just roturned from Berlin. I an reporting to you as

one of many obsorvery who are agreed that the neaponleso men and women

of Eastern Germany stand as the Mi'st line of defense botwoen us and

the tyranny of Sovlet Pover. The entire world is nor awaro of what has

been happening 1n East Berlin and East Germany since Juro 17, 1953.

But do you know why this most remarkablo revolution occurred -

hois these peoplo just like the goung couple next door, the truck

driver do the streat, the band lesder - have baon abin to rebel

against overwholning odds?. It is not only out of shear dosperation

beesuso of the insufferable conditiors under indich thoy have been

Jiving. People in the other satellites are suffering.

Thöse are

peoplo who are desperatoly weary of tyrants of all political shades

Through the windor of Nest Berlin te savo then hope for

a botter world and they have become our allies. He cannot let them

When we do we have lowered the first defense in the battle

against tyranny over the minds, hearts and bodies of mon.

The enclosed personal accounts of the Junu 17th robellions

are dramatic proof of man's invincible desire for froedom. The Inter-

national Rescue Committee 1s doing evorything rossiblo to aid these

brave men and women including some of the resistance loadors and pro-

scriked members of their fanilies. No need your bely to continue this

vital work.

We are asking you to send us your contribution so that we may

continue to sustain tho bodies of these brave men and women in whom

the flame of freedom is burning.

The aid me are extonding to them is

a message the whole world understands. A message which says that we

hellave in the dignity and goodness of people enougi to help them sur-

vive their norst times so that thay can flght for botter times.
