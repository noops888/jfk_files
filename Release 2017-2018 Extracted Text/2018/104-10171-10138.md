The Eacazae Progres veo originally outlined tn CEPCIRTEL 676,
January 29, 1952 (Top Sacret) which indfoated that the Progras would
be undortaken through oontracte with voluntary agencies to provide
certain supplies and services to escapacs of recent date. Inacguch
ap the largeot end oat important voluntary agonctes cporating in
Durope are of religious nature ani endeavor to etay clear of unter~

Eacapoo Progres would euppresa vo the oxtunt posetble tne porttical
nature of its operations in order to oecure and saintain the “good

DRAFT

Dear : 4

As you might surmise, your organizatton is well
known to the Agency. Following the receipt. of your
letter of 31 March 1976, a more definitive search for
information pertaining to your request was conducted,

No information was located which would indicate that

‘CIA has ever provided funds either directly

or indirectly. -I trust this letter will allay any

apprehensions your organization has had in this

matter,

If I. can be of further assistance, do not

hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

George Bush
Director
