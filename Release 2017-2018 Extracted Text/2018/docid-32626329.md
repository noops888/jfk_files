Nemorandum on

General, Joseph MOBUTU

Goneral Mobutu is young (32) end personable but.

sonerhat imature and vain. He responds well to flattery

and expecto recognition of the close and confidentlol

relationhip he bes enjoyed vith US officiels. He shoved

courage in neutralizing extremist politicans, expelliag

coumniat Aiplorate in 1960, and, more recently; in quelling

a police mutiny by talking into the mutiseers cemp and

ortering then to lay down their orus.

Although be was once deeply involved in politiea

Robutu now prides hinself on being a soldtes, aloof from

politica.

He is nevertheless & etsunch eupporter of Ascula

and & nether of the pro-lesters

"Biaza" political group

thich advices Adorla: Hobutu te olso proud of hie entir

comminien.

Nobuta does not a√ªnit the AlC is as bad es it ie. He

thinka that its "godernisation" ahould be eccomplished by

the asaignment of Belgian officers to the AlC who would vear

e Congolese untforn and be under hts command.

He reluctantly

secepts the political reusoning for & multi-national training

effort and bas been delighted with Ioraeli prontees of rapid

assistance. He blanily envianges the Us partleipation. in the

retraining progrom as & mind of getting new equipment for

bie forcos, and does not yet recognize the respontbality the

AIC will bave under the progran to repair and restore esteting

egalpment.

In the ourse of his vialt ve hope Mobuta can be made to

reallac that:

1) It ta conential to the econoute otability of the

Congo that the ANC be reducod raptaly to 25,000 men.

Mobutu

Bocepte tads cetling but my stall on actual demobtlieution.

2) Tho future sell being of the Congo dependa on an

Intentre effort to restore discigline and bring an end to the

outragon perpetrated by his men.

3) While the national troining contingente sill operate

under the authority of the GOC and v11l cooratnate with Mobutu,

they cannot be made an integral part of the AlC.
