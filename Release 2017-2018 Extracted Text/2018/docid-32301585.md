From the outset, EVELIO ALPIZAR PEREZ waS

requested to obtain the identity of the bank on whom

the checks in this case were drawn.

Unfortunately, he

was unable to recall the specific name of the bank on

which the two checks observed by him were drawn, or

the signature of the maker.

He did recall that

the bank

had the word "National" in the name, but he was not

absolutely positive about this.

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

on the basis of his information,

It is believed that ORLANDO BOSCH and the

treasurer of the MIRR may have a special checking account

In the name of some relative, friend, or other member

of the MIRR

but that most likely, in any event, the

address would be the same as one of those listed on the

FD-227's dated March 3, 1964, submitted to the Bureau

by this office.

ALPIZAR has been on the alert to obtain more

information concerning the identity of the bank in question

is very unlikely that BOSCH would disclose such

information to any other source or informant who might

be developed for this specific purpose.

It is also to

be noted that BOSCH is very security conscious, which

makes it more difficult for ALPIZAR to ask specific

questions which might arouse BOSCH's suspicions.

In view of the foregoing; it is requested that

the Bureau reconsider the FD-227's

submitted by this

office.
