ReBulet, 3/10/64, denying Miami request for
appropriate mail covers in this case.

From the outset, EVELIO ALPIZAR PEREZ was
requested to obtain the identity of the bank on whom
the checks in this case were drawn. Unfortunately, he
was unable to recall the specific name of the bank on
which the two checks observed by him were drawn, or
the signature of the maker. He did recall that the bank
had the word "National" in the name, but he was not
absolutely positive about this.

On the basis of his information, the records
of all logical banks in Miami were checked with negative
results. It is believed that ORLANDO BOSCH and the
treasurer of the MIRR may have a special checking account
in the name of some relative, friend, or other member
of the MIRR, but that most likely, in any event, the A
address would be the same as one of those listed on the
FD-227's dated March 3, 1964, submitted to the Bureau
by this office.
