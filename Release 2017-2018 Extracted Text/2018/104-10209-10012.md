The OS ALD CASE

NOSE!KO's knowledge of the KGB's interost in

Osinin stented from his clained Tourist Department

assignrents.

He asserted that while Deputy Chief

of the imerican Section in 1959 he participated an

the iSB determination that OSSAID was

of no operational

interest.

In September 1963, When NOSTiKO was Deputy

Chief of the Tourist Depart-ent, he was informed of

OStPiD's visit to rhe Soviet Erbassy in "exico City to

apply to scturn to the l'SSR. Immediately following

President Kennedy's assassination, NOSENKO,

as

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, reviewed KG3

records of OSWALD'S stay in the Soviet

Union including

the Second Chief Directorate file on OSWALD.

For concinulty of presentation, both periods of

NOSE:XO's alleged involverent with the OSWALD case

(1959-69 and 1963) are discussed here.

The infornation NOSENio provided on the OSWALD

case is significant if it substantiates NOSENKO's

claired positions

the KG3 and

confirms the validity

of his clain that he knew the extent of KGB involverent

with OSKALD.

NOSENKO's Information

Residence in the USSR

PIiOI tO OSWALD's arrival in the USSR, he was

completely unknown to the KGB.

Horeover,

upon

receipt of his visa application, the KGB

Second Chief

Directcrate determined that he was not of sufficient

importance to justify any special interest by the

Sevcht: Departrent.

Not until

about October 1959,

when OSWALD expressed a desire to remain in the USSR

did he come to the attention of HOSENKO, Who was, at

that tine, Deputy Chier of the imerican Section of

the Seventh Department.

All available materials on

him sere thereupon collected and examined -

the visa

application, Inturist reports, interpreters' reports,

reports fron. hotel agents, and the results of a check

of KGS Archives.

VOSENKO's subordinate, KRUPNOV

intervicwed the interpreter to whom OSWALD had stated

his wish to stay in the USSP.

Although the KGB considered it possible that OScALD

might be an anerican agent, the kGb did sothing to

investigate this

possibility because

"this would be

done after the porson is allored to staj in the soviet

Union. "

Surveillance of OSWALD was not increased after

his request, and OSALD was not interviewed by the KGB

in an attempt to establish his intentions.

KRUP:OV

sent NOSENKO, his chief, a memorandum on inforration

which had been received

concerning OSWALD.

The razorandun

cated reports by rG3 informants at the liotel Berlin,

where

OSKALD was staying in accordance, with an Inturist atancrary

and a two-page report by the Inturist Interprcier to whom

OSWALD rade his initial request to renain in the soviet

Union.

A file inco-porating all information thich KRuPtoV

had collected was thereupon opened in KOSEio's section.

From this inforration NOSENKO and KRUPNOV concluded

that OSWALD was of no interest to

the KGB, and both agreed

that OSWALD appeared sonerhat "abnorma!."

For thes reason

NOSEUKO Instructed KPUPHOV to advise OSwALD through

the

Inturist interpreter that he would not be permitted to

rerain permanently in the USSR and that he must depart on

the expiration of his visa, then seek re-entry as a

permanent rusident through normal channels at the Soviet

Embassy in Washington.

KRUPROV folloied HOSANKO's orders,

and

either that day or the noxt Hostiko icarned that OSHALD

faled to appear for a scheduled tour arranged by his

Inturist guide.

This prompted a scarch, and after several

hours,

OSWALD was found in his hotel room, blending heavily

from self inflicted wounds. After hearing of this

incident

fron KRUPNOV, NOSE:K0 then

reported it to K.N. DUBiS, Chief

of the Sovertil Department.

NOSENKO believed

that DUBAS In

turn Icported it to GRIBANOV, head of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

GRIBAOV upheld NOSENKO's original decision

that the KGB should not become involved with OSWALD and

that OSWALD should not be permitted to remain in the USSR.

There was no attempt to debrief OSWALD because "he was

not an interesting person and wasn't normal."

rOSENO did not know who eventually granted

OSriALD permission to reside terporarily In the USSR

or who approved issuance of his temporary rcsidence permit.

Reavest to Return to the l'SSR

The KGB Second Chief Directorate was not concerned

with OStALD's return to the United States in June 1962,

by whach time NOstino was Deputy Chief of the Seventh

repartment.

No further word on him was received at KGB

Headquarters untid he appeared at the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City in September 1963 and requested a visa to

Post-Assassination Review Of KGH File

NOSENKO noxt learned of OSAID's activities as a result

of President kennedy's assassination.

About two hours after

President Kennedy was shot, NOSENKO was advised of this fact

in i telephone call

to his home fron KGB leadquarters.

short while later he was told,

again by telephone, that the

President had died.

About two hours latcr, NOSENKO was told

that OSALD had been arrested, and he and

of the American

Tourist section

werc called in to determine

whether the KGB had any information concerning him.

After

establishing OSWALD's identity from KGB files and learning

that his file was still in Minsk, NOSENKO phoned the KGB

office in Minsk on GRIBANOV's orders.

The local KGB dictated

over the telephone a surmary of its file on OSHALD.

This

summary concluded with the statement that the KGB in Minsk

had attempted "to influence OS!ALD in the right direction".

GRIBANOV had been greatly disturbed about

the local KGB's

efforts because it had been given specific instructions to

carry out nothing other than passive measures against OSWALD

there.

lic ordered that all records in Mirst: pertaining to

OSKALD's stay there,

as well as

an explanation of the

meaning of the statchent about influencing OS"ALD, be flown

immediatcly to Moscow by military aircraft.

NOSENKO personally

read the explanation from Minsk concorning the meaning of

this statement and thoroughly reviewed OS ALD's file when

it arrived by plane.

He then turned the file over to s.ll.

FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the American Department of the KGD

Second Chief Directorate, who prepared a two-page summary

memorandun for GRIBANOV.

This

memorardun, which NOSENKO

read, was forwarded to KGB Chairman Semichastnys,

and

somichastay in turn reported to the CPSU Central Committee

and to khrushchev concerning it.

OSWALD's file from Minsk contained no information to

indicate that the KGB in Minsk had taken any action with

respect to OSWALD contrary to instructions from KGB Head-

quarters.

From the date of OSWALD's arrival in the USSR

until his departure, the KGB had no personal contact with

him and had not attempted to utilize him in any manner.
