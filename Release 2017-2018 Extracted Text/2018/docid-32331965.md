photographs in the space of approximately 20 seconds.

. At

present,

these photographs are being developed but it is

doubtful whether they will be of any value to this investigation.

No additional photographic surveillances are

contemplated from the POST home or elsewhere in New Kensington

because of the obstacles outlined above

The situation will be

followed closely, however, and in the event MANNARINO should

ever appear in public without sunglasses photographic

surveillances will again be considered.

ALBERTO ARDURA, aka., Alberto Ardura Moya

Investigation conducted to date in Miami and Jacksonville,

Florida, discloses that ARDURA, a Cuban National and part owner

of the Tropicana Nightclub, now living In Ormond Beach, Florida,

with his family since the collapse of the BATISTA government,

has been identified in connection with an exchange of long

distance telephone calls to NORMAN ROTHMAN, now under indictment

in this case,which included calls to "SAMMY" in New York City

during February, 1959, who is probably identical with

national top hoodlum SAMUEL MANNARINO.

For the benefit of all offices, ARDURA has long been

recognized by the Pittsburgh Office as a confederate of SAMUEL

MANNARINO. As an example, MANNARINO In October, 1956, advised

, that he had shipped a number of slot machines to ARDURA and

ROMAN in care of the Tropicana Nightclub in Havana, Cuba,

and pointed out that Cuban Government, at that time,

granted them permission to place the machines in various spots

thought tea ate eat a per that time admitted that

Moreover, Havana 4, Interviewed by the Legat in

September, 1956, described ARDURA as the principal importer

of slot machines in Cuba associated with MARTIN FOX in the

operation of the Tropicana Nightclub.

Havana 4 at that time

characterized ARDURA as a close personal friend of Colonel

ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, brother-in-law of former Cuban

dictator FULGENCIO BATISIA and director of the Cuban Nationa.

commission of Sports. Havana 4 said at that time that

through the influence of MIRANDA, ARDURA had no difficulty

1n placing slots on location In Cuba: (U)

To further demonstrate ARDURAIs closeness to

MANNARINO, It Is Interesting to note that during the Top

Hoodlum investigation In New Kensington, It was discovered

that during the perlod, March, 195%, to July, 1957, the

New Ken Novelty Company, operated by MANNARINO, shipped 137

slot machines and five boxes of slot machine parts to

ALBERT ARDURA, In care of the Tropicana Nightclub.

on the basis of

past experience in the Top Hoodlum

Program, there Is little doubt that MANNARINO, ROTHMAN and

ARDURA are very close and it is not beyond the realm of

possibility that ARDURA, along with ROTHMAN, could have been

the receiver of the National Guard

weapons when they reached

cuba.

It is significant that Dr. LOUIS C. PESSOLANO,

when first interviewed concerning the part he played in

the

gun-running conspiracy, came up with the name CECIL HARDURA,

as the person who instructed him to rent the twin engine

Beechcraft for a hunting and fishing party. Dr. PESSOLANO

has, of course, Implicated ROTHMAN as the man who instructed

him

in the matter

since that time but in his effort to hamper

the investigation, PESSOLANO may have unintentionally brought

out the fictitious name HARDURA knowing that ARDURA was

involved in the conspiracy.

PHILLIP JAMES MAINER,

FBI #868314A

It is recalled that MAINER and his associate, GEORGE

FLOREA, FBI #2888609, were named by Canton, Ohio,

Police

Department Informant at the beginning of

this investigation

as the men who committed the burglary at the Ohio National

Guard Armory on 10/14/58.

It is also recalled that supplemental investigation

In New Kensington established that MAINER was in contact with
