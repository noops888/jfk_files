MEMORANDOM POR THS RECORD 4
SUBJECT: Mareos DIAZ Langs

2. | Jt would appear that subject left the U.S. for Mexico some menths ago
on the advice of a lawyer, that be vent to Mexico, thereby violating his parole,
and then couldn't ret a visa to get back into the U.3, He was a ittle upset

After a couple of mo:chs, it was finally agreed that he would te allowed to re-
enter the U.S. on parole. It 4s very confusing -ho advised what,
who, or way, but IkkS seemed to think CIA was Pushing the hardest, but now has
changed its mind. Be that as it may, they seen to have set up two interviews for
subject at the Eebassy, at the first of which he was told all the tad aspects
of bis situation, but--failed to tell him they had agreed to let hi> back in the

U.S, on parole. So subject took off on his ow with the aid of sae Catholic
organiezticn, swam the river and made his way to Washington where be contacted

~—
about this since he says he was just trying to legalize his status in the U.S. \

an unstated Congressicnai, probably Senate, comzittee, who passed hin on to Iexs, —#

apparently Generel Svirg hixself. The General was not nleased, because chrionsty
be had & rot potato. In short there were objections to every possitie solution.
Subject has a wife and two children legelly resident in Florida and one of the
children is an American citizen, and omns a hone there, so paroling the subject
anywhere else might cetse some bed publicity. coesuias

2 In the absence of Hr. Seehafer, Hr, JORDAN of WH Division wes asked to -

go over with Mr. Pennington to a meeting with IaK3, at 11:30 on 1 April.

'. Henessey reviewed the case and wented to know what CIA wanted done with DIAZ,
and Kr. Pennington and another person said they had tzlked to Shef Z¢wards and 4¢
had been agreed that the new policy on paroles would probably be the test thing
ae that might keep bin out of our hair in Florica. Mr, Henessey reviewed alot
of the legal situation and said in practice it wouldn't work, and he wanted an iu-
mediate decision as to whether CIA would say that it was in the national interest,
and in writing, that CIA vanted subsect held smewhere. After consultation sith
Gol. King, Mr. Reynolés and Kiss Tharpe, Mrs JORDAN said that 4t dicn't seem likely
that CIA would express in writing much of any desires or wishes about subject.
Mr. Henessey then brought subject in and gave’ him a stern talk about his obligations
and conduct under parole. The parole papor wae finally drawn up, and at about .

4 p.m,, subject was released.
