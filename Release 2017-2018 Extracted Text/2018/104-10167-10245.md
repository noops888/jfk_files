HENSORANDIM POR THE POCOED

•SUBJECT: Yareos DIAZ Lang

1. It would appear that subject left the U.S. for Mexico some months ago

on the advice of a lawyer, that be went to Mesdeo, thereby violatina his parole,

and then couldn't ret a risa to get back into tbe

U.3.

He was a little upset

about this since he says he was just trying to legalize his atstus in the U.S.

After a couple of no: hs, it was finally agreed that he would be alloned to ro-

enter the U.S, on parole.

It is very confusing ho advised what, wro was pushing

who, or thy, but Ilis seened to think CIA was yashing the hardest, but now has

changed its wind. Be that as it may, they seer to have set up two interriers for

subjeet at the Babassy, at the first of which he was told all the bad aspecta

of hia situation, but-failed to tell him they had agreed to let his back in the

U.S. on parole.

So sabject took off on his on with the aid of sore Catholic

organizztion, swan tie fiver and made his way to Washington where he contacted

an anstited Congressional, probably Senate, comittee, who passed hin on to I&NS,

apparently Ceneral Srirg hirself. The General was not pleaged, becauge obrievel

be had a tot potato. In short there vere objections to every possibie solution.

Subject has a wife and two children legelly resident in Florida and one of the

children is an Anerican citizen, and owns a home there, so paroling the subject

anywhere else might cause some bed publicity.

2 In the absence of Mr. Seebafer, Mr. JORDAN of it Division was asked to

go over with !. Pennington to a seeting with Ilis, at 11:30 on 1 Aril.

Ar. Henessey reviewed the case and wanted to know what CIA wanted done idth DIAt,

and Mr. Pennington and another person said they had talked to Sbe? Edwards and it

had been agreed that the new poliey on paroles woald probably be the best thing

ae that might keep bin out of our hair in Florica.

Hr. Henessey reviewed a: lot

of the legal situation and said in practice it wouldn't rork, and he nanted an 1m

mediate decision as to whether CIA would say that it was in the national interest,

After consultation with

cod. mine that a and are hold can aid ere it alte on likely

that CIl mould express in uriting zuch of any destres or wishes about subject.

Kr. Henessey. then brought subject in and gave hin a stern talk about his obilgations

and conduct under parole.

The parole paper was finally drawn up, and at about

I pollo, subject nas relessed.

3. Mr. JORDAN had a brief conversation with aubject in a tarl poing dom tom

as subject was in a hurry.

He implied that Idng had impressed on his to get out

of town as cuickly as rossible, and said they had told him to go to his home in

pilot who lived 2t Loreto 11, Mexdeo City, sho according to a fadre had agreed to

8o to the U.S. on 2 April and pici up a plane. Later thie plano volie earry aras

for Castro to Cuba.

The above, with the excertion of the part about the Merican pilot, was

sumarized for Ki. Reichhurdt by D'one at 4:30 p..

5. Mr. Hernessey commented several times about sending a letter to Mr. Dalles

asking that a policy line be estabiished that nore of our people shoule discusa

the details of imigration procedures and status with persons wio vent to, or we

nant to come to the U.S.

He reraried that Stace should have sone kind of overt

escapee progras, so that CIA vonlin't get all this "garbage".
