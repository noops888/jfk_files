SECRECY AGREEMENT

1. I, -

dared i. Torches

-, understand that upon enter-

Ing on duty with the Central Intelligence Agency I am undertaking a posi-

tion of trust in that Agency of the Government responsible to the Presi-

dent and the National Security Council for intelligence relating to the

security of the United States of America.

I understand that in the

course of my employment I will acquire information about the Agency and

its activities and about intelligence acquired or produced by the Agency.

2. I have read and understand the provisions of the Espionage Act, Title

18, USC, secs. 793 and 794, and I am aware that unauthorized disclosure

of classified

information relating to the national defense may subject

me to prosecution for violation of that Act, whether such disclosure be

made while I am an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency or at any

time thereafter.

3. In addition, however, as I am undertaking a position of trust, I have

a responsibility to the Central Intelligence Agency not to disclose any

classified information relating to the Agency without proper authoriza-

tion. I undertake, therefore, not to discuss with or disclose to any

person not authorized to hear it such information relating to the Central

Intelligence Agency, its activities, or to intelligence material under

the control of the Agency. I further understand that this undertaking

is a condition of my employment with the Central Intelligence Agency, that

its violation may subject me to immediate dismissal for cause or other

appropriate disciplinary action, and that this undertaking shall be equally

binding upon me after my employment with the Agency as during it.

information is classified and if so, who is authorized to receive it,

the Agency, and failure to obtain such a decision will be grounds for my

dismissal.

5. I understand that my unauthorized action or utterance in the nature

of a publication or which would reasonably be expected to result in pub-

licity on intelligence or intelligence activities would be in violation

of Government and Agency regulations and would be grounds for my dismissal.

6. I understand that for all grievances and complaints there are estab-

lished procedures within the Agency permitting appeal by any employee of

will be considered a violation of the undertaking set forth above in

paragraph 3. If the appeal procedures are inadequate in any situation,

I am aware that the Inspector General is at all times available to any

employee with a legitimate criticism, grievance, or complaint.

7. I further understand and agree that my employment by the Central In-

telligence Agency is conditioned upon my understanding of and strict

compliance with CIA Security Regulations, and the appendices thereto.

8. Inasmuch as employment by the Government is a privilege not a right,

in consideration of my employment by CIA I undertake not to publish or

participate in the publication of any information or material relating to

the Agency, Its activities or intelligence activities generally, either

during or after the term of my employment by the Agency without specific

prior approval by the Agency.

I understand that it is established Agency

policy to refuse approval to publication of or participation in publication

of any such information or material.

nection with my official duties with the Central Intelligence Agency

render, upon demand by an appropriate official of the Agency or upon

separation from the Agency, any material relating to such information

and intelligence in my possession.

10. I take the obligations set forth above freely, without any mental

reservations or purpose of evasion.
