of the vorld for peace", and only Coamunist ideology will survive, etc.

Hequin already has been branded a counterrevolutionary in an officiel Acta,

possible sabotage, and also wanted to utilize his undoubted talert and

Bequin is extrenely eager to get ‘out of Cuba, but he. “does wot. “have a

Aa, of Aug 60 the three mejor refineries confiscated by the Castro ragins saan |
.8€@ operating in fairly good chape. Their principal problem ie that
the Soviet crude being supplied is very light and they cannot run as
mich volums because gs8 pressure builds up. The Beso refinery, for
example, hago capscity of 36 thousand bbla per day on heavy crude, but
26 thousand bbis per dey ia the best they have besn abie to do on the
Soviet crude, and it kes been msnaing at a rate of only 20 thoussnd bbls
Per doy since 20 Jul 60. :

‘The Soviet crude available to date has been coupatible with the refinertes
and will not damage them, but in addition to not being able to gat as
much volums, the ztfineries cansot get as mich fuel ofh because of light
ends. This is trus of all three major refineries.

The! refinertts vere designed for 26 gravity crude which is fsirly heavy.
The Soviet crude is 33 gravity, and has caused on imbalance in that
thay are now producing more gasoline than is needed. As @ consequence,
Cuba is searchicg desperately for fuel ofl. The USSR has said that it

- is mot in a position to supply fuel ofl and so Cuba has turned toward
Mexico, even to the extent of attezpting to arrange deals whereby they
will trade gssolime for furl oil.

‘The |imbalance of gasoline is indicated by the fact that the Cabaigusa
reficsry was shut down recently becauce its gasoline storage was completely
filled.

Lode:

Cuba will reach @ eriticsl point abeat 1 Sep 60. The Esso refinery slowed
down! from 26 thousend bble per day to 20 thousand bbls per day because
it bad only a 10-dey supply of crvde. The supply on hand was eufficient
to Last caly until 16 Aug, tut around 11 Aug the refinery vas supposed

THis 1s UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE

1, a Aug 60 the Castro regime sent two representatives to the US to attempt
to obtein replacement parts and machinery for the oil industry. One of -
these men is Julio Caunedo, on the staff of ICP, and the second io Leonel
de Paula Paula Arias, a former employee of Easo Standard Of! SA,

2. Da Puls is about 28-29 years-old, 6", 180 ibs. He has black curly hair
and fair skin. He is married and I believe has one child, He is a Roman
Catholic; and has never been considered. as having any left-wing: inclinations.

3. Be Paul speaks excellent English, and I believe studied in the US, He has
@ degree in engineering and worked three years with the Esso refinery,
mainly in maintenance and construction. As of Jul 60 he was. section head
of the Refining Department, Purchasing and Warehousing.

4 The choice of de Paula to go to the US to obtain necessary supplics is
sound because he is the man which the company would heve chosen to do such
& job 1£ required. He has a reputation of being a good hard vorker,
imtelligent and de;endable. He has @ pleasant personality and handles
binselt very well. i i ee

3. De Paula was considered one of the better. men of the plent and could be

: elessed 28 @ key technician because of his knowledge, background, and

ability, end it would definitely hurt the Castro regime if he fled Cuba,
However, the opportunities for employment in the oil industry in Latin
America! are not good becauee there is considerable prejudice against
Cubans on the pert of. other countries in which there are refining operations.
