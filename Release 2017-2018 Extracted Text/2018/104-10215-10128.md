As of Sep 60 there appear to be done significant developmente eceurring

mong persemel of the staff of the Caban Petroleun Inotitute. the

Institute has commendeered a building of lano Standard O11 SA for

me as haadgarters, and le currently engaged in miring the personnel

of all three intervened ofl copanies in the new headquarters.

The ahuffling around of personel has further lovered the sorale of

the petrolen industry exployees, and I have been told that 95% are

strongly in fror of the cospanies and against the Castro regime.

Stace ICP established its new offices, Indoctrination sensions ef employees

have been scheduled on a twice-a week baste.

The flest session was

held recently and uas concerned with the "Colored Problen of the Horld".

The slot of the remka of the conference leader was that Cabana were

of: Spaniah ethnie origis, and because of the close ties of Spenterda

Ind the Moore for so nany hundreds of years it had to be renlized that

a11 Cabena had colored blood, und should not make a distinction and

should have no prejudices concerning people with colored blood.

The secend indoctrimation session wen headed by an overt Conmatet fron

the Denon Company, He delivered the straight Party Line, anti-is,

ant1 Inperlallat, natf-monopoly, "The Soviet Union la She grent hope

of the vorld for peaca", and oaly Consunist Ideology will survive, ete.

He also seated that, 'The Declaration of Havana of Fidel Caatro vill

be our doctrine," and said that it was desired to obtain the signitures

of tha shole population of Cuba to show that everyone wan behind thie

doctrine. He then said in response to a question regarding what would

happen to those who did nos sign, "you are either for us or "gainet us."

At this, one of the office sirla who had been a atrong Fidélista got ep

and remarked that such comments remioded her of the Barinta days, and she

strongly dleapproved of any pressure tactics.

Although mixing the employses of the three companies was done doliberately

to break up a feeling of trust among enployees who knew each other, and

to Introduce a fealing of fear concerning atrangere, there hns been close

cooperation on the techateal level between employees of at lesot two

rofineries. For example, techniciens at Reso and Shell recently collaborated

in shutting down the refineries uithout real justification, allegodly

because of Hurricara Donna.

When the word got out that the rofineries

there was no denger, and that the action should

technicians then said,

"Well, it is too late now," and they kept the

concerned enjoyed this ulnor act of sabotage hugely.

They slso cooperated in denlying action waen they were ordered to start

the cat plant.

LiC tE needed badly, do the technielans deetded to keep

the unit shut down.

ICP officialo screamed that it uas unrecessary

and ordered then to start, but the technicians seid that te una not

practical because it was too difficult,. and possibly dangerous, to stop

and start the sinit. They said that the shortage of catalyats made it

impossible to figure on keeping the unit going, and so it was not tha

rant thing to do to stert 1t at all.

Connequently they have been able:

to keep the cat unite shut down completely since the stern.

An' of Aug 60 the three nojor refineries conflocated by tha Castro rogles

The imbalance of gasoline la lodiented by the fact that the Cabniguán
