MEMORAKDUM FOR: C/CI/OA

SUBJECT : Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. The Provisional Operational Approval for L
(C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.

2. In discussions with the field case officer

JTAMIL-9

for this

operation, WH/1/Mexico has found that there is no baie to
le:

determine when, or whether, LITAMIL-9 will again
For reasons of personal security, LITAYII-9 has not
able to Tunction as a reporting evusee sauce Lis

Cuba in early March 1965. Letters to his brother,
and reports from occasional Cuban official traveler!
Mexico indicate that LITAMIL-9 is well and is emplo
National Cultural Council.

3. LITAMIL-9 is new an inactive agent. The S'
has recently proposed that his salary cease accumul:
as of 30 June 1966. If and when he again manages t
Cuba, he will be contacted and a full assessmeit of
future usefulness will be made. Owing to the fact
sister-in-law is a secretary to Fidel Castro it is
that he will be a valuable source of information,
for an initial debriefing period.

al

4. It would be appreciated if the POA on LITA
could be extended for six morths. If at the end of
time he has not left Cuba, it will be proposed that|
POA be allowed to expire.

SUBJECT + Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITAMIL-9,

who has recently returned to Cuba, anc as accepted ai
mission from Mexico Station. The Station has express:
reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged
1959 that LITAMIL-9 was a Communist, since this cours

to our interest in LITAMIL-9, Wil/1 has concurred in
decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogat

re ae

mance record,

action would unnecessarily draw attention of this sie

FI
d its
in

of

his

ry

2, Realizing the risk involved in working with any

Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAMIL-9's excellent
of cooperation, plus his acceptance of tue idea of co!
cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of a
Operational Approval. Additionally, we have had audi
coverage through the telephone in LITAMIL-9's office
the past two yeais or more, and during this time the
has used the installation fer spot checking his infor
and is satisfied that there are no reasons to questioi
veracity and security or suspect that he is under con’
of the Cuban service. ie

3. Attached fer your review are several contact
reports of LITAMIL-9, as requested by Mr. Lally.
prompt return will be appreciated. This office will

MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: LITAKIL-9, Report of TDY, Andrew S. Parmers|

1. Durtng 21-26 February 1963, Andrew S. PARMERS
travelled from Headquarters to Mexico City on TDY to train
LITAMIL-9 on various clandestina, operational, techniques,
including SW. Upon arrival in Mexico City PARMERS ascertained
that LITAMIL=9 allegedly became of moral inbibitions, wes
puvilling to receive training and algo unwilling to ackept the
S¥_syatwes Headquarters had issued for him, and which PARWERS
had carried to Wexico City. Neverthetess, PARVERS met) LITAUIL-9
three times to determine the agents precise objections| and to
overcone them if possible. Although the agents geners
Teaiatance was not overcame. PARUERS Aid reviaw with EPTautTria
clandestine methods and techniques in a general way,

2. The first meeting was held. at the Station case
officers ho with the Case Officer present. LITAMILLO ex=
Plained his reasons for refusing to be trained and for| ot
being willing to communicate in SW with KUBARK while Cubs.

Genera) ly LITAMIL-9 cJaimed that he is very norvous, and
incapable of performing clandestine tasks without having ©
Rervous breakdown and at the sax- tine getting binself caught

in the act because of his general incomvetancy. Also, |LITAUTL<9
was planning to stay at nis brothers home in Cubs, and|felt

it vould be unethical and immoral for him to be coumingonting
Clandestinely with KUBARK while accepting the hospitality of

his brother and sister-12-law who are staunch supporters of the
Castro regime. Thess szreements obviously had rizeady |boen
Presented to the Case Officer who had already ve ag that

LITAMIL-9 could not be moved from his position. Ths ent
furthermore, felt that there was no need for training dr SY
@ince he would be returning to. Mexico after only three months
in Cuba. He displayed a cable he had just received fram his
father answering LITAMIL-9's query as to what might be |hi

ext assignment. The cable stated that LITAKIL~9 would mast
likely return to his present post in Mexico. The agent, thtve-
fore felt that upon his return: to Mexico City, he could be
febriefod by his Case Officer. LITAMIL-9 rejected all jattonpte

to convince him of ovr need for current info from insi
He was adanent when we pointed out that he might not r:
Mexico City as hoped, but might havo to remain in Cuba,
Bo means of contact. If this happens he Plans to rem.
position and return to Mexico as a private citizen,
already is a registered "resident" of Mexico,

* SEGRE



“Be

: 3. On Friday, 24 February, PARKERS spent most of
the day visiting alone with LITAMIS~9 at the Jatter's fpart-
meat. By the end of the day LITAWIL-9 had softened 2 little
and bad revex'ed some of the personality traits montioned a
below. LITAKIL-9 also agreed to communicate with his Case-~ Prk me
Officer throves open code in letters to his brother in| Mexico!’

City, He aleo was willing to mect inside KUBARK,’ praflerably

if the contact was s diplomat but not Cuban. He agrecd to a
take a set of cuff links as bona fides. As a suggestion, he
mentioned that his friend, The Swiss Ambaseador, coy |serving

in Madrid, Spain, would be an ideal eontact. In revealling how

euch a contact could be performed ana in discussing LI|TAMIL-9

modus vevendi {ns Cuba, there was coneiderablo discussions

concerning operational Security and clancestine procedures

LITAMIL-9 cea apply while in Cuba,

4. LITAMIL-9 during this meeting also presanted,
in logical seqvence, his reasons for believing that he will
return to Mexico Citv. Ranically. he fala that hatwoen the
fact that he has many contacts in Mexico City (where he sas
lived and worked for many year
in-law in Cubs has a responsible position with considerable
influence in the Castro Government, he LITAMIL-9 wi?) [be re-
assigned to his present post in M-xico City after three months
of leave, consultations, and training in Cu

5. The third meeting ocurred in the evening of
25 Februar.. in a car pick up situation, with the Casa Officer
present. This time, LITAMIL-9 was Jess willing to communicate
with KUBARX while in Cuba than he had been during the previous
meeting, but with some reluctance, agreed to the use of open
code and to b= contacted by some diplomat. This meeting. there-

fore, was a3 routine operational meeting, with his Case Officer
in charge.

6. Based upon their three meetings, PARMERS formed
the following opinions of LITAMIL-9: fie is a shrowd oppor-
tunist, willing to colloborate with KUBARX against the Castro
Government, but not to the point where his personal s
is endangered. He dislikes the Castro Regime because
fumbled so bad'y, and because the current Cuban officilels are
erude and incompetant. He greatly admircs the American people, "
but definitely. feels that we aro merely concerned about our 7
own nations] security and well-doing. LITAMIL~9 owes bis
first loyalty to the fine arts, has little Patriotic feelings
towards Cuba, since he bas lived in Mexico for #o many, y:
and hss declared himself to b¢ a resident of Mexico. [He is
now serving the Cuban Government simply because he bad an
Opportunity (through his sister-in-law) to achieve official
Status and income and-still remain in Mexico where most of his



. “33s *

| pergonal friends reside.

7. Although at first appearance, and according to
his own opinion stetemcats, LITAMIL-9 appears to be eztremoly
nervous because of his clandestine activities in behalf gf
KUBARK and against Cuba, after sone discuss:on /t was spparont
that he actually relishes these clandestine actions tkat|ho
would have angaged in then long before he did, and that he 7
would bave continued # covert relationship with KUDARE even after
Castro falls, serving either in Mexico (whers he has maa
contacts of inter-st to KUBARK) or in Cubs ia some post in
Some future government, Hs has excellent rssport with his
Present KUBARK case officer. He statos that as long as KUBARK
remains willing to acceot that he has defin‘t> personel Jimi~
tations, (since ke can perform only those clandestine tasks
related to his cover and cannot be trained or induced toldo
anything eJse) he will gladly continue collaborating with
KUBARK a8 long as dasired.

8. Actually, PAPMERS feels that LITAMIL-9 would
do most snything we would desire if KUBARK would someday
establish some control over him. His preseat remarks co: cerning j
his moral qualze are artificial. He has great aporeciation
for_shrewdness and double play, and oponly 1 te_haviag H

1 life, On many occasi 2 simits [that :
he has accomodated himself to s situation for profit te da

he knew that he could tura the tables eventually on hi
verseries. When he is off-guard he admits to being 2 codl j
operater who caa scheme and work behind bis adverearies’ |backs.

He shows many signs of enjoying doing what he does for and
with his present KUBARK case officer, i ‘

9. Io summary, although LITAMIL-9 did not ace pt :
training or SW in the standard sense, PARWERS believes that the
agents reluctance was based on his desire to take few risks. !
The agent is competent, his moral inhibitioas are probab’ iy
A faked. lie is convinced that he will return to Mexico in, and
i to continue serving KUBARK if no greater risk ts |in-
Since ZUBARK at oresent has no clear control roe

| or ideological) over LITAVIL-9, it was difficult to impode i
KUBARK's will over him. But he is very willin, in for
KUBARK within the limitations he g2ts, and tf someday we |can
atisfy.some personal need he might have, te bas the vot ential
of becoming ® good controlled agent for KUBARK. He ‘s intell— H
igent and by nature ho. seems to instinctively conduct bt i
elanéestine operations in a secure manner. | :
