A/DO0/O
; SUBJECT : Driver Case (Mail Intercept) -
i Church Committee Report
| REFERENCE : A. OGC Memo 76-6704, 29 November 1976

B. DOJ Letter, 22 November 1976,
Same Subject

. 1. The reply from our CI Staff in response to,
aoe your request for a review of the Church Committee
at report on HTLINGUAL (pp 561-636) is attached. Included
in their attachment are copies of several reviews of
the Senate Select Committee drafts as presented.

: 2. The DOJ asked in Reference B if the facts in
the proposed stipulation are true. We call your atten- .-
tion to the CIA Staff comments that the material is
essentially correct as far as we are concerned, but the
Office of Security as well should comment.

3. With regard to the DOJ's request in their
letter to provide any documents prepared by the CIA or
other Government agencies which show the Church
Committee report is inaccurate on the mail opening
aspects, we call your attention to Pages 3, 4 and 5 of
the CI Staff comments (Review Staff Document 76-0264).
sits Speaking for the Directorate only, we do not believe
see that this is what Justice is seeking. Briefly, it
does not appear that the material in the report is
that seriously flawed. The comment's are addressed to
the Select Committee report with different pagination
than the final version available to us. If you wish
to make this material available to the DOJ in response
to Reference B, we have no objection, although you may
wish to get the concurrence of the OLC who now is
responsible for this material.
