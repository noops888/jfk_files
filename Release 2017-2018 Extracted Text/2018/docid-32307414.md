Vehicle. aspects of this case are being handled in the

Miami case titled "ROBERT PAUL CURTIS; ITSMV", Miami

file 26-34692, Burea√π file 26-407068.

Referenced report dated January 6, 1969,

contained, beginning on page 58, an interview with

CHERYL

SCHLECKER, in which that individual described how she and

subject MAX GONZALEZ traveled to Mexico in August, 1968,

BANNISTER was later identified by MM 1312-C as RAY BRUCE.

Subsequently, Miami investigation disclosed that the true

name of RAY BRUCE iS LOMEN RAY BRUCE, whose wife is CARRIE

LYNN BRUCE. CARRIE LYNN BRUCE, also known as LYNN BRUCE

and LYNN BANNISTER, was located and interviewed on March 18,

1969, results of which interview are set out in instant

report.

LOMEN RAY BRUCE was interviewed on March 24, 1969,

results of which are set out in details, and was ostensibly

cooperative.

However, his version of the trip to Mexico

differed in several basic aspects from the story given by

h a rain not dare

his wife. It is believed that BRUCE has more information

regarding the cars driven into Mexico by himself and GONZALEZ,

and more knowledge regarding FIORINI's plans for subject

organization prior to onset of actual operation, than he

divulged during interview.

Re-interview of BRUCE will be

Considered should Legat, Mexico City investigation produce

information warranting this.

The BRUCEs evidently returned to

the U.S., singly or together, without participating in the

Mexico phase of the IACB operation, except that the car they

drove into Mexico was probably a rental car disposed of in the

same

manner as

other rental cars previously mentioned in this case.

WELLS would indicate that all three continue to tell diverse

stories.

SAPP indicates-that.hewould testify to the fact

that he, WELLS, HULBERT and STOY left Vero Beach in a late

model, Tight-colored,

small-Sized Chevrolet apparently in

SAPP, who displayed a cooperative attitude during

Miami Office interviews is now being contaded as a PCI.

HERBERT JOSEPH FENDER, interview of whom appears

in details, and who was previously contacted in this

matter, is

currently a racial source of the Miami Office

(MM 1334-R (Prob) ). No attempt was made to conceal

his identity because he is available for testimony

concerning

the information furnished.

Numerous contacts with Lt. CARL PEASE (NA),

Vero Beach Police Department, Vero Beach, Florida by

SA DAVID C. CALIAN have not developed any further information

concerning the Vero Beach subjects in this case.

On February 4, 1969, Lt. JOHN MC CANTS, Indian

River County Sheriff's Office, Vero Beach, advised SA

DAVID C. CALLAN that he had received no reports of any

stolen or misappropriated rental cars during August and

September, 1968.

Regarding Departmental request for further

investigation in this matter, per referenced Bureau airtel,

it is felt that re-interviews of CURTIS and MANNING have

resolved as much as

possible discrepancies in their

previous descriptions of transported weapons.

denied knowledge that FIORINI furnished weapons to be

transported to Mexico by MANNING and/or CURTIS.

As indicated in details interviews, there are no

U.S. Government records which

would corroborate the

travel of FIORINI or any members of his group from

United States to Mexico.
