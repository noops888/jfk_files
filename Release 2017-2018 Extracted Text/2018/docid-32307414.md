1. Will continue efforts to obtain information regarding
ITSMV and Neutrality Matters aspects of IACB-CASTRO Operation.

2. Will await Departmental decision regarding
possible prosecution in this matter.

ADMINISTRATIVE

Interstate'Transportation of Stolen Motor
Vehicle. aspects of this case are being handled in the
Miami case titled "ROBERT PAUL CURTIS; ITSMV", Miami .
file 26-34692, Bureau file 26-407068.

Referenced report dated January 6, 1969,
contained, beginning on page 58, an interview with CHERYL
SCHLECKER, in which that individual described how she and
subject MAX GONZALEZ traveled to Mexico: in August, 1968,
with RAY and LYNN BANNISTER, in 1968 Chevrolets. RAY
BANNISTER was later identified by MM 1312-C as RAY BRUCE,
Subsequently, Miami investigation disclosed that the true
name of RAY BRUCE is LOMEN RAY BRUCE, whose wife is CARRIE
LYNN BRUCE, CARRIE LYNN BRUCE, also known as LYNN BRUCE
and LYNN BANNISTER, was located and interviewed on March 18,
1969, results of which interview are set out in instant
report

LOMEN RAY BRUCE was interviewed on March 24, 1969,
results of which are set out in details, and was ostensibly
cooperative. However, his version of the trip to Mexico i
differed in several basic aspects from the story given by i
his wife. It is believed that BRUCE has more information '
regarding the cars driven into Mexico by himself and GONZALEZ, |
and more knowledge regarding FIORINI's plans for subject
organization prior to onset of actual operation, than he
divulged during interview. Re-interview of BRUCE will be :
considered should Legat, Mexico City investigation produce fl
information warranting this. The BRUCEs evidently returned to !
the U.S., singly or together, without participating in the i
Mexico phase of the IACB operation, except that the car they
drove into Mexico was probably a rental car disposed of in the
same manner as other rental cars previously mentioned in this case.

River County Sheriff's Office, Vero Beach, advised SA H
DAVID C. CALLAN that f had received no reports of any
stolen or misappropriated rental cars during August and
September, 1963.
