MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUNJECT: Jeremy K. BENADUM, Payment of Annudiy

REF: DIRECTOR 101776

1. Al the time of transmittal of Reference, I had been informed

that the military service still had not been verifled. In talking about this

matter with Mo.L

asked if he would request MMPD, possibly through

suine scan stracant to sergeant or colonel to colonel whether the matter

could be expedited. He assured me he would glve this an all out try and

agreed to let me know during the forthcoming week.

2. In checking this morning I find that Mr.

is out on leave

and going into traling for at least the next week: to asking how lo get

in touch with Mr.

eventually Mrs.

came on the line.

She ndvised that nothing new was in the record and there was no info

on the verification of the military service and wished to assure me that

just because someone wont on leave or was out that a cise was not dropped.

I asked then If any affort has been made to contact MMPD. She said the

file didn't reflect anything and agreed to check MMPD and let me know.

ADMIN/CONTRACTS

Reference:

3340

Reference Indicated Jeremy K. BENADUM had proposed an

extension of his retirement from 31 October to an appropriate date in

December 1070 ln order for him to use his annual leave in lieu of lump

sum payment.

Shortly before the COS left Headquarters

& meeting

was held during which the Branch Chief discussed contract personnel of

the Station.

Ref was discussed and it was the COS's desire for there to

be an amicable separation at the time of BENADUM's retirement. Il,

therefore, the extra two months would accomplish this, then the added

costs would be worthwhile.

8. The following annulty figures have been provided by tha Retire-

ment Office and are predicated on a retrement date of 31 December 1970.

Please keep in wind, the figures must be considered as estimates and

subject to verdication of service and final computations. Retrement

would be under the Organization Program.

1. Reference asked Headquarters guldance In desercining

possible adjustment In the Quartery Allowance for Jeremy K.

BENADUM, Career Agent. Reference stated:

--BENADUM purchased his local residence 1 December

1964 for $50, 200 and cust of utilities average $98 monthly.

-- Although the current madmum Quarters Allowance

for BENADUM Is $1, 700 per annun:, the Station has been paying

at the rate of $4, 128. 80 per annum.

-- Reference forwarded a list of BENADUM's estimates

of utilities costs and a INPURE memo on personally owned quarters.

2. The formula described In Para 3 of the LNPURE memo

has been used in prior cases and la that which la also used by tbe

Allowance Committee.

Based on this fortul, 10% of $50, 200

(original purchase price) plus 51, 176 (yearly utiltles), coal 96, 196.

The amount granted BENADUN would presumably be the maximum

unless the Station had determinod a lesser rate was applicable due

3. Using the effoctive date (5 October

Jor the current

Quartero Allowance rate $4, 700 ($4, 100 plus $600 for dependents)
