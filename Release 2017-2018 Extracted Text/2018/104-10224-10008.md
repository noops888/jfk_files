operational support, the latter being his most outstanding area of

running CI operations, His knowledge of CA type work, however,
cannot be assessed at Headquarters,

Subject's cover is a natural one and poses no difficulties,
Since Subject has been in the intelligence field for over 20 years,
he is psychologically prepared for his dual role in intelligence
operations and ia well qualificd to operate without strong Station

support,

PERSONALLY-OWNED QUARTERS,

onal ly=
following memorandum which has been sent to
a number of posts may be useful as a guide to our policy on the
subject:

When an employee occupies personally owned quarters his SF-1190
should show in Section 21 (5) the initial purchase price as
shown by the deed, Scetion 21 (6) (7) and (8) should show
annual rates for utilities as authorized by Section 132.5 of
the Standardized Kegulations (Government Civilians, Foreign
Areas), “Thése are the only items of cost to be cunsidered,

When the quarters allowance system provided for reimbursement

for quarters costs within a predetermined maximum, the regulations
provided that the allowance for personally owned quarters should
not exceed 10 percent of the purchase price, converted to dollars
at the exchango rate available at the time of purchase, plus low-
able utilities, The 10 percent of purchase price was amplo to

take care of taxes, deprectation; repairs, interest on investment,
and amortization of the costs within’a reasonable period of time
by U: S. standards. Only light, fuel, and water could be added

in arriving at the allowance.

Under the current quarters allowance system, it is expected that
the flat rate will be pald unless the authorizing officer believes
it necessary to reduce the payment under Section 124,2 of the
Standardized Regulations, The employee in personally owned
quarters would be treated the same as any other (except that

ho cannot receive advance payment of quarters allowances under
Section 113 of the Standardized Regulations). This makes
unnecessary .a special rate for personally owned quarters, The
requirement to report the purchase price on SF-1190 is to pro-
vide: the authorizing officer additional information to be consider
together with any other pertinent local circumstances, in deciding
whether reduction of the allowance is necessary and, if so, how
much, Only the utilities costs are to be considered in addition
to the purchase price except in tiose rare instances where Land
rent 4S involved, Recause of varying conditions between posts

and individtals, it was not considered advisable to specify any
certain percentage of the purciase price that should be considered.

In addition to the information on the SF-1190, the authorizing
officer should consider local circumstances, which vary greatly
from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally
owned quarters should be treated any differently than the employee
in rented quarters and receiving the flat rate allowance,

: al, Apral, 1969

SUBJECT? Involuntary Retirement

1. A deak officer from Headquarters visited the xéxieo
City Stetion during mid-November, 1968, While here, the visiting
officer talked with the writer for approximably one hour regarding
the operation of the Litempo project and writer's Plans for the
future. The following points were disouseed?

(a) The fact that the project was eonsidored to be an
important and successfuh one,

(b) Writer was specifically asked if he had any plans
for an earl; retirement, writer replied in the negatives Tho

visiting officer indicated complete satisfaction with writer's
jJesire to continue in the service, and noted

|

(a) When the visiting officer aaked whether the ariter
had ever visited Headquarters during bis career with the sarvice,
and found that he had not done a0, the officer asked whether
writer could arrange to viait.veadquarters for a week or ten days
during his next home leave, which would take place in 1969.6
Writer indYosted that he would be most pleased to do s0s

2. Based on the foregoing, writer made plana to procead to
2969, to return

tha United stat on home leave in

in 1969. Sinos auch WAEtera cannot be handled on
short notice, eriter has already rented @ house in San Franaiseo,
California for the pertod in question,

This 1s where mttera stood, when, on 7 April, lest,
uriter was advised that he would be retired, effeative 30 June,
1969, in aecordence with various ohanges of policy. He ans also
asked to confirg in writing that he is in scoord with the plan
to place him on retired otatus as of 36 Juno, next,

4. While the rosaoning behind what GSppears to be a complete
reveraal of polioy, viowaevia the uriter, may be orystal clear te
fhe responatdle uffiotals at Headquarters, writer 1a at eo eoaplete
loas to understand,



For the writer to indicate his agreszent with a plen which
appears.to him to be arbitrary, short-sighted end irraticral, would
a a bo completely out of charaoter-for @ person-who has. spant. almout i
thirty years in the intelligence field, and has a justifisble pride
in his status as.a professional intelligence officer, As a
--———professional, writer also realizes when the handwriting, nowever
illegible. it might be, 1s on the wall, and, thet if the dasieion
has already been mate to retire him involuntarily, then retired he
; will be «=. involuntarily, Little as it may matter, writer desires
£ to emphasize that nothing in this memorandum should be construed
to indicate writer's personal ecoord or approvals

5s According to writer's records, aa of 30 Juns, next,
he will have compisted the following government service:

Y¥re. Mos, Daza

(a) Hilftery: 2nd. Lt., 30th U.S.
Infantry; Presidio, San Fran-
aisco, 26 det., 1939 to 31
TULZ, LWOsccccevscereceeevee 9 6

(b) Speoial Agent, 12 Auge,
1940 to 31 October, 1960..... 20 2 18

(oe) Career Agent, 1 Nove,
1960 to 30 June, 1969....+04. 8 8

(4) Accusulated A/L aa of 30 June,

1969, = 656 hra, seeeee 3 22

Total Service we... 29 11° 16

Writer desires to completo thirty years’ aervice, and requeata
thet the effeotive dete for hia involuntary retirement be set

sooordinglye

6. Nose Taave: Shile eriter readily understonda the
rationale oF @ Fultng preventing the taking of home leuve at
government oxpenge within two yeara of voluntary retiruaent,
he does not see that tho interrata of falrnoas, jJuatiae cr
deoanay are Lelns served tn attempting to apply the sane ruling
to sriterte involuntery retirement, Aa a aatter of pooaidlo
hiatortaah tat {ter deotros to point out that, shen he

oined the ger SC, he volunterily g#ve up the hone
{tare ehias he.hed earced @ith the (S yoare). @riter hes



of November, 1963, writer hes made plans for home laave from
arse t ys Writer feels most strongly that
_ Be and his fanily should bo allowed to taxe this leave ct

taken home leave in 1952, 1964 and 1966, in aeoordancs with
remulationge In line with what appaared to be Agenay policy ae

government expense.

i 8, In oonolusion, writer wishes to state that he hae
thoroughly enjoyed his assostation with the Agenay during the

Past nine years, and 4 id of hia part in the acecmslishmenta
of a to the nature of eriterta
posttion, his personal oontaata have baen largely lizited to
the personnel The writer haa the highest
professional and personal regard for the Chief of Station, with

whom he has been privileged to serve, as wall ay the highly
competent case officers who have worked with writer on tne projeat

It 1a a ecureo of great satisfaction and pride to the
writer to have known and worked with a truly great American,
Mr. Allon W. Dulles, whom the "San Franeleeo Chronicle® (generally
a hostile oritio of the Agenoy) described posthumously ag
“y..The most creative, powerful and eminent U.S, intelligence
effioer of modern tines", And, a3 one's career comes to a alose,
the words of President Nixon, in desoribing Mr. Dulles? great
eontribution to his country, have @ very particular significence:
“.eoln the nature of his task, hie achievements were inosn to
only @ fow, But, because of-hin, the world te a safer ploce today"
