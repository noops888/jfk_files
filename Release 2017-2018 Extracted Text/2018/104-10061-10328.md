SEGRET

27 June 1978

MEMO FOR : SE/SAG/OP

from

: SE/OP/S

SUBJECT

: Sergey Aleksandrovich UZLOV (201-948382)

1. Returning your 201 herewith. As you will recall I borrowed 201 since UZLOV

had reported on an acquaintance who reportedly knew OSWALD. This information

and Source's identity was passed to CI/Staff to be given to HSCA in view of the

latter's interest in OSWALD et al.

2. Thanks again to you and Victor who phoned UZLOV to alert him to potential

query from HSCA. To date, I personally have no details as to whether HSGA

pursued lead!
