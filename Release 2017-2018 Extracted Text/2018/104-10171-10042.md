1. According to AMHINT-42, on 20 May 1963. odupejut 2200 hours,

jocal, the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) mounted’ an
operation independent of JMWAVE support, infilte ting AMHINT-40 and
AMHINT-53 [at "Kawama ,: Varadero Bosch (23i0N-81160), The two-man 10
tein was Tunched successfully and observed as they moved up the beach
and across a field to a lighted dwelling which is an operational
AMIINT safehouse, However, after the team were safchoused and during.
Jaunch dinghy by the parent craft JUANIN I, a 12-man
vetitin patrol discovered them and challenged. During the brief fire
fight that ensued, the JUANIN I crew reported that two to four militia
see e vere observed to drop under their fire. (According to reference

wen onfirmation of this operation there were no militia casualties,

BG the local militia post also reported they had d§f{licted two to
tngce casualties “on the escapees".) The JUANIN I suffered no casual tiep

or-hits, retired. from the beach at speeds up to 30 knots and returned

arrived in Miami and reported to DR) ces ae 'S operation,

2. At 1515 hours on 21 May, the DRE offices in Miami received a°
commercial cable in prearranged code indicating the team had arrived

(Subject of a following gigparen. tL lis the safehouse owner who
weceived the: team, provided change of clothing, food, shelter, sent

the cable confirming safe arrival and later transported them to Havana.
Subject did not witness the beach encounter, but heard the. fire-fight
and overheard reports of the encounter during a visit to the Militia
Post the following morning.

3. The most significant operational factor of this mission.is
that the militia post has reported the incident as an ‘escape” and
has not suspected that an infiltration operation has taken-place, -
Therefore, no search or raadblocks were set up and it can; be assumed
that ANHINT safehousing in that area is gtill“intact, It is also im-
portant to note that; although conjecture at this point, apparently
the GOC has net given this clash the propaganda treatment given the
patrol encounter of their CV-28 with the SUSAN. ANN because it. was -
*eported as an “escape"and therefore any casualties inflicted on escapes
Would not make sympathetic propaganda. Also, there were reportedly no
militia casualties to give this clash propaganda value.

1. This operation was mounted by orders of AMHINT-53 who was
becoming understandably desperate about DRE internal conditions.
Subject had been scheduled for infiltration three times over the past
three months and cancelled for reasons ranging from mission reception

coming @fter a long history of DRE internal support problems and
obstacles, some of which resulted in costly operational lesses and
gonpremises, prompted AMHINT-53 to mount. the infiltration at any cost.
Subject's primary mission is to identify and confirm appointments
within clandestine apparat at national and provincial levels. Oper
tional losses through arrest and KIA or execution during past four,
months has resulted in almost two complete turnovers in leadership
at national levels, His secondary mission is. to organize the National
Reception Committee for materiel supply and infiltration of paramilitar!
instructors, radio operators and intelligence agents. For this purpose|
AMHINT-40, who has operated as National Reception Committee Organizer
for almost. two years, formed the team with ANHINT-53. These Preparatiohs
within PBRUMEN should be ready by the time their radio operator,
ANHINT-52, completes his training.

5. Some of the pertinent operation details follow:

Be ent JUANIN I is a new, 30-foot, BERTRAM built “Moppy",
recently purchased by the DRE. for their infiltration and supply
operations, _ They have tvained their crew and equipped their vessel
with the idea of offering it to JMWAVE in return for ¥/T communications
and armament support for their missions. Such a support agreement
has been approved in principle by JMWAVE and details are being worked
out by the Maritime Section, JMWAVE,

Merchant vessels were observed and avoided since it was feared that

7. Upon arriving at their launch point, beach conditions were as
expected on this day of traditional festivity. The small park known as|
\y "Parque Infantil Inig", was illuminated and.much of the local populace
wére dancing in the Pavillion, AMHINT-42 selected a point about 500
yards north of the par& and about 500 yards: from their nearest safchousp..
As he brought the JUANIN into’about 200 yards of the beach; the moon
was at about a 25 degree elevation and a fringe of pine shaded most
of the deserted beach area where the team would land. The JUANIN is
a ‘dark blue camaflouge color aud was apparently not readily visible
from the beach. The team. bomrded the 12-foot, fiberglass dinghy with a
6 hp outboard and accompanied by AMBOUY-2 and Bernabe PENA for protec-
tive cover fire, proceeded to the beach. The landing was smooth and
without’. incident but after the team had made their way up the beach,
through the pines and acress the field to the safehouse, a patrol of
about 12 militia came down. the beach,

8. The launch dinghy had just started from the beach when ‘two of
the militia ran forward and challenged them to stop and return to the
beach.: AMBOUY-2 and PENA opened fire at about 40 yards range, chsery-
ing that both militia men dropped to the sand, The patrol then opened
up with one burst of automatic fire as the dinghy got underway to the
parent JUANIN, Meanwhile, the JUANIN came in to about 75 yards to
recover the dinghy and retire from the beach. at top speed, During
recovery, the patrol kept up fire from one automatic weapon which was
ineffective and did not score one hit on personnel or craft. .

9. Upon return to base, the JUANIN crew were warned by:
AMHINT-42 of security implications and responsibilities of the
operation, i.e. any leak in Miami could result in the compromise of
AMHINT safe housing in that area as well as the death of the infiltrees|
There was no contace with ODYOKE agencies upon departure or re-entry
