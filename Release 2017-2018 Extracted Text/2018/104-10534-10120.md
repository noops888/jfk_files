S. OSWALD Case: The opening session was a polygraph
examination conducted by Nicholas Stoieken, whom NOSENKO
recognized as his earlier polygraph operator. The question-
ing was devoted entirely to Lee Harvey OSWALD and NOSENKO‘'s
role in the OSWALD case. We hit this point before any other
in order (a), to permit clean polygraph testing on this key
matter without having disturbed him with other questions,
and (b), to get. over to NOSENKO the gravity of our concern
on this matter of ‘highest state interest. The operator's
conclusions weres

a. .Subject was not personally or actually in-
volved in the OSWALD case from 1959 while OSWALD was
in the Soviet Union.

be. Subject received special instructions (from
the KGB) about the OSWALD case and what to tell An-
erican authorities about it.

e. Subject's alleged association with the OSWALD
@ase both “before and after" the Kennedy assassination
was partly for the. purpose of supporting and sub-
stantiating Subject's cover story "“legend*®.

d. Subject heard of OSWALD (as a case) only after
Kennedy's assassination, however he was not an active
participant in 1963 as he indicates, but was probably
briefed on the case by a KGB officer.

6. Geneva Meetings:-. We devoted. several hours of inter-
rogation end polygraph testing:to the Geneva periods, June
1962 and January-February 1964." We hit this point: second in
order because there“are clear.signs of important déception
behind it .and it offers us special opportunities to suggest

- inside: information Which in fact derive from obsérvation and
deduction. - “Among ‘the’ high pointd were the followings

- Ge. Pavel “SHAKHOV’. NOSENKO's story of. his "“investi-

gation" of SHAKHOV, ‘a Soviet delegation member whom he

said‘ was. suspected in -1962 to be an, American agent, was
@overed again in detail. ‘The new data we obtained tend
to confirm that this {s a serious part of NOSENKO's
