Anstrucciones de averiguar cuales eran sus contactos en Guatemala. Dijo
que el propio ministro de releciones exteriores de Costa Rica, Gonzelo
Faccio, le hab{a mostrado un documento procedenta de.la CIA (estes fuse
ron sus palabres) en el cusl se demostrabaja que Goch habia tenido rele=
_ elones en Guatemala con el hijo del exepresidente Avena, Jorge Roberto
Avena Eepsfa (Tito).
: Agrag6 Géngora que era muy probable que el) contacto entre Boch
y Tito Arana se hublera hecho por medio de ine cubenos Gerardo Sampedro

Who atv these terrorist? What motivates them? How do”
they operate? And why are US. ullicials so concervied about
what they may do in the future?

To answer such questions Orr Kelly and Cart J.
the US News & World Report stall dug deeply E
records, intiryiewed Cuban refugees who share the hopet aa
though not the methods of the terrorists, and talked to law
enforcement officials who are trying to stem the violence.

BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISM t

Alor Fielel Castro tock over Cuba in 1959 and it became
apparent that he intended to establish umiatist ‘state.

{800,000 Cubans “voted with their ‘feet™ and fled their

homeland. Some 600,000 of them settled in the United i
States. They and their children now total 750,000, Most of .
them live in the Miami area.

‘The majority of these: imusigeants are law abiding, But |:

virus of vinlence cuit grow. ; . 7

And they: know they-can't go buck until Castro is gone. So

they dream of topplir.4 Castro, What is clearly unrentistic in H

fice, the US. Customs Service. and the US. Bureau: of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Although the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force,
its agents work closely with it. :

With co-operation from Cuban refugees who are sick of
the terrorist violence, law. officers have arrested a number of

Police also have learned enough about other sus-

pects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence:
‘ean be limited even though there is not enough evidence to
prosecute them. “=.

A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might
have some knowledge of terror operations. ;

Efforts of law-enforce.nent officials to deal with the terror-
{st groups face formidable handicaps, however: The terrorists

teem to know what police are doing. Licutenant Lyons...

relates that one suspect “identified one of my officers who
had never met him before, called him by name und told him
‘what section he worked in and what his duties were."
Terrorists are protected-by a web of old loyalties: Most of
them worked at one time or another for. the U.S. 'Govern-

‘ment. Many have had several roles: members of. the U.S...

‘Army, CIA operatives and FEI informants. One refirgee
leader suggests that law-enforcement officials have not found
the killers of Cubans “because they don’t want ta.”

‘A further complication is the: heavy infiltration of the. -

i

movement. by. members of Castro's ‘intelligenco

corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as
teurs, instiguting terrorist acts designed to:

supposed agent has kept the Cuban Government fully in:

ment and instructions he has feceived.”

Castro blamed the for the airliner bombing and other
acts of vinlence- Ise bit. the CIA... . can curry out
these acts?” Castro asked. 5:

Scerctary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.
involvement in the-airliner bombing. He said: “I can state,
categorically that no offi Gi
ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in
‘contact with the Amesican Government has had anything to
do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this
totally reprehensible.” -

The CIA declines ta discuss Cuban refugce terrorist. -
Officiais‘of other Government agencies say they seriously
doubt that the CIA, after all the criticism it has received for,
some of its carlier, activities, is still involved in operations
against the Castro regime, However, the agency is described
ing. very. tittle help in combatting the terrorist,
groups. “We fave absolutely no contact with the CIA,” suys
Licutenant Lyont “I'd like to, but tey don't talk to us." One
reason for that attitude may be that lawa bar the CIA from
domestic law-cnforcenient uetivities.

‘Other laws, or the lack of them; also complicate the fight
