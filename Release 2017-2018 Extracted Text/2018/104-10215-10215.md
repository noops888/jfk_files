Evaluation of services = As the principal e<ent
and station cut-out, HUVAHOLD 1s charged with the direction
ani cuidance of HUMANOID-1; KVMAHOID-2; HUMANOID-33
HUMABOID-h, Hic handling of these agents is carried out in
@ profesaional and efficiont canner, and his personal coments
end corrections on their reporta, based on hie long acquaintance ©
with local personalities and conditions, are of considerable
value. His attitude remains enthusiastic end willing.

Evaluation of information - The information produced
vy the agents being handled by HUMANOID te of great value
to the station. In addition to his ovn production, thie
agents operations aro vell suited to checking oa information
received froa other sources.

ay CQSENTS - Despite the fact that HUMANOID han been working umer
certain operational restrictions for a mmber of months, his value to the
etation contimues to be of major importance. In addition to the tangible
and measureeble irformation produced by and throush him, EUMAEOID has
Proved to be the single nost valuable source of backzround and or:entation
data for the Chic? of Station. His knowledge of the history of

comamist activities and personalities, and hie grasp of the various

revolutionary movements and-figures has been freely shared vith the

Chief of Station. These “briefing meetings” represent an intangible
ecntribution to the over-all performance of the Station. HUMANOID ts
eager to expand his operations and upon the removal of present operational
Festrictions it is believed that be can be given further responsibilities
particularly in the recruiting of adiitional sub-azents. . The station is
presently interested ‘n accocplishing a parallel penetration of the
Comamist Party im expanding routine investigative coverage
and in developing additional @ources on political movenemts. It is
believed that HUMANOID can insure the success of these new ventures.

received several days after the forwarding of TRSA-1056, which
recommended that subject te considered for czreer agent’ ststus. Al-
though TRSA-1056 furnished certain of the data requested by head-
quarters, the foilowing additional information, queries and comments
are set forth with a view to facilitating a final evaluation of the
project.

2. Pursuant to the approval contained in TRSW-655,
dated June 29, 1951, HUMANOID has been and is currently acting as
cutout for HUMANIST-2, as well as for HUMANKIND-1 and HUMANKIND-3.

It is therefore not clear whether paragraph 2,b. of TRSA-685 is to be i
interpreted as a new restriction on his activities which is to be placed
into effect at this time. In other words, is headquarters’ approval

of the suggestions contained in TRSA-950 now withdrawn? .

3. As discussed in TRSA-950, assistance was extended
HUMANOID in setting up a photography and photocopy shop on the fringe
of the downtown area. Funds formerly used for rental of a safehouse
were applied instead as rental for his photo shop, with. the purpose

HUMANOID's local employee; and 3) the lack of any secure storage

the following
suggestions are made for headquarters” Cons: tion: 5

‘ a. Humanoid at the present time is acting as cutout and

i chief agent for Humanist-2, Humankind-l1, and Humankind-3. There
is no other agent at the present time to whom these contacts can

i: be given. It is believed that if these subagents ere allowed a : '

6-months vacation, they will become practically worthless when

picked up again and have to work for the money they have been i

receiving, aside from losing interim information and developments.

b. In an effort to establish a more secure, as well as a
- comeercial, cover for Humanoid, this office has acceded to : 7
Humanoid's desire to set up a photography and photocopy shop in :
the downtown area, and has encouraged him in it by allowing funds
‘paid-for-rental-ofa-safehouse_to be=apolied_instead—as rental
for his photo shop. This provides Humanoid with a good cover in

Place for Humanist-2 to mi rm

c. Therefore, it is sugzested that Humanoid's semi-weekly
contacts with Humanist-2, instead of being cancelled, be changed
to a weekly letterdrop, and a live contact once a month to take
care of salary payments and briefing: This letterdrop can be
effected by Humanist-2 passing by the photo shop at night and
dropping his messages through the slot in the door usually used
for after-hours delivery of films to be developed. The film
drop will be into a padlocked box, accessible only to Humanoid.
