1. TRSH-685, which advises that the expiration cate of

this pro-joct-has-been-determined to be 29 February 1952, was

received

recommended

that subject be considered for coreer agent status.

Al-

though TRSA-1056 furnished certain of the data requested by head-

quarter forth with a view so facilitating a final evaluation of the

the following additional information, queries and comments

project.

Pursuant to the approval contained in TRSW-655,

dated June 29,

1951, HUMANOID has been and is currently acting as

cutout for HUMANIST-2

as tell as for HUMANKIND-i and HUMANKIND-3•

It is therefore not clear whether paragraph 2.b. of TRSA-685 is to be

Interpreted as a new restriction on his activities which is to be placed

Into effect

at this time.

In other words, Is headquarters approval

of the suggestions contained in TRSA-950 now withdrawn?

As discussed in TRSA-950, assistance was extended

HUMANOID in setting up a photography and photocopy shop on the fringe

of the downtown area.

Funds formerly used for rental of a safehouse

were applied instead

as rental for his photo shop, with the purpose

of providing a safe meeting place between HUMAROID and HUMAMIST-2 and

to provide a more accessible spot for the processing of HUMANKIND

material.

Farly in July 1951, after two or three weeks experience

with photostating HUYARKI'D material at the studio demonstrated the

unsuitability of the arrangement, HUMANOID resuned his plotostatic

work in his own hone.

Tre studio has continued to serve as a meeting

place for HUMAMIST-?. Tre following considerations entered Into the

decision to discontinue processing HUNANKIND-1 and 3 material at the

photo studio: 1): The conspicuous nature of the equipment in a small

shop; 2) the security risks caused by the presence in the studio of

HUMANOID'g local employee; and 3) the lack of any secure storage

space for comprosising naterial

-HUMANOID states that he is unable to devote surricient tine to the

business to keep it going without an assistant-and-that it wouid be

quite difficult to locate a competent vorknan at the salary level he

can afford to pay. The above ficts,

plus unfavorable findings of a

recent financial analysis of his business, have convinced HUMARCID.

states that HUKANOID must discontinue using his home to reproduce

the material obtuined fror: HU.AWIND-1 and HlWANKINI-3

brief history of safehouse experience at this station is set forth.

Accordingly,

heaiquarters aivice is requested as to whetrer HUl'ANOID may continue

In reply to your request for corent on the silary

In addition, MINANOID

His financial position negates his

In connection vith Paragraph e. above, it is to be

by advice fron tbe Erbassy Consular Section that the Immigration

authorities at the sort of entry into the United States may cenand a

$500.00 U.S. bond in substantiation of her intent to return to

This station 1s therefore considering

Hunarold Project

1. In connection with a re-examination of the security

factors of this Project, a pre-arranged visit to the home of

Humanoid

was made by the writer.

As previously reported,

subject

has constructed a secret dark room under the floor of his house.

and processes the production from the Humankind Project it this

work room. It is therefore necessary that certain compro-ising

saterial is retained overnight by Humanoid, anu,

at present, this

naterial is kept in a wooden desk with a cheap lock.

Although

breaking with theft as a motive cannot be overlooked, with resultant

serious security considerations.

2.

It is therefore requested that heedeuerters

consider furnishing a snall wall safe with a combination lock for

installation in the above-mentioned dark roon.

It would be possible

to sink the safe into the concrete wall, and even if complete con-

cealment were not possible, the safety of the material would be

greatly enhanced.

Suitable safes are not available locally, but

It isknown that Remington Rand markets a

snadd strong box with a

combination lock (price about $20.00) which would be ideal.

3. I would appreciate receiting your opinion in this

matter inasmuch as other measures must be taken in the event a safe

cannot be made available.

Inasmuch as Humanoid is aware of the proposed salary

raise recommended by the former Chief of Station in the Quarterly

Report dated Aurust 17, 1951, Inforsation as to the status of this

recommendation is requested.

operations. He was employed in the technical surveillance on

the home of

the photography incident to the HUMANKIND project, which work be

performs in his own quarters. (This may now be performed away from

HUMANOID's PHS shows the following points which

From the above circumstances, it appears possible that HUMANOID'S

Humanoid at the present time is acting as cutout and

chief agent for Humanist-2, Humankind-d, and Humankind-3•

is no other arent at the present time to whom these contacts can

be given. It is believed that if these subarents are allowed a

6-months vacation, they will become practically worthless when

picked up again and have to work for the money they have been

receiving, aside from losing interin information and developments.

b.

In an effort to establish a more secure, as well as a

comercial, cover for Humanoid, this office has acceded to

Humanoid's

desire to set up a photography and photocopy shop in

the downtown area, and has encouraged him in it by allowing funds

paid for rental of a safehouse to be applied instead as rental

for his photo shop:

This provides Humanoid with a good cover in
