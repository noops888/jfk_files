Joe Chagra had also stated that the

"note" was currently in the possession of

law enforcement

officers and that he (Joe) had a "contact" with one of these

officers and was thus able to find out the contents of the

alleged note.

The note was supposedly recovered

from Harrelson's

personal

effects subsequent to his arrest in early September, 1980.

Jimmy Chagra also advised Irwin that the final payment

on the $200,000 assassination fee had just been made to Harrelson

in the last

two of three months at El Paso, Texas.

This money

had been paid Harrelson but the exact amount of the balance

payment was unknown by Irwin or James.

In conversation with Irwin, James has been able to

determine the facts concerning Jimmy Chagra and his relationship

with Charlie Harrelson.

According to Irwin, Jimmy Chagra

first met Charlie Harrelson when both were gambling, perhaps

poker, at Las Vegas, Nevada, just before Judge Wood was killed

in May, 1979. AS

result of this meeting in May, 1979, a

"contract" was given to Charlie Harrelson by Jimmy Chagra

against the life of Judge Wood. James did not exactly know

how Irwin came to know these facts but believes Jimmy Chagra

had told Irwin.

In conversation between Travis Irwin and Jerry

Ray James, both have discussed the facts which Jimmy

Chagra has told them concerning the murder of Judge Wood.

It is the conclusion of both

Irwin and James that Jimmy

Chagra is truthful when he stated that he was responsible

for the death of Judge Wood; however, Travis Irwin doubts

the truthfulness of Harrelson's statements that Larry

Culbreath was the "trigger man" at the murder of Judge Wood.

Irwin has stated to James that he knows

"everything Larry

Culbreath has done in his life," and Irwin stated that

Culbreath has denied any participation in the wood murder

and Irwin is confident that if in fact he (Culbreath) were

involved, Irwin would have known of it by now.

James stated

that he trusts Irwin's statements regarding Culbreath anc

Iwin thinks of James as a "god" and

"looks up to James",

and would not withhold anything from him.

James advised

Irwin

and Culbreath had grown up together in Texas and have been

friends in excess of twenty years.

Irwin had also determined from either Jimmy Chagra

or Culbreath himself that Culbreath was arrested either the

day after or two days

after the wood murder while Culbreath

was driving Harrelson's car from San Antonio to Pleasanton,

James did not know the nature of the arrest and only

it occurred between San Antonio and Pleasanton, Texas.

Irwin has also related to James that just prior to James'

arrival at Leavenworth in June, 1980, Jimmy Chagra had told

him (Irwin) that Harrelson was

"good, real good at doing

Since this statement was related to James in the

about the murder of Judge wood, it was

mutually understood by James and Irwin that Jimmy Chagra's

statement had

reference to Harrelson's ability to "fill

contracts", e.g. murder for hire.

With regard to Jimmy Chagra's solicitation of

Jerry Ray James to procure six or eight individuals to

smuggle marijuana into the United States, as well as the

murder of a former witness against Chagra, James is firmly

convinced that if he refused to locate the individuals

for either "job" for Jimmy Chagra, Jimmy would reach out

and find someone else to do the work.
