3.__On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830
at Gden B; AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in
high Spirits. He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able
to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions
in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that
he had to live under a regime he obviously hates.
quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the
HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to remain in New York until December
1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look
after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks
prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to
think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise
to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts
about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.

4.  AMCLOCK/1 explained that he could not make contact as instructed

In fact, he seemed

hecause he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation
addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He
destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN
in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals
at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had

nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for

his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press
the issue. Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekman
site and of the Base in New York (Iden L) and told he could always cal

there if he could not locate DI GE SO at
the JMWAVE number for emergency contact.

He was treated "royally" by
the AMTEUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see
him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri-
vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.
During this time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent
invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats. However,
by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually
suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer
allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs
and he had to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given

6. In reference t.i his w.fe AMCLOCK/] stated that he is now
convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After
their marciage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political
ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her
disagreement on a number of occasions. He feels confident that she
would follow him in any movement against the regime, such as defection,

1. On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1130 to
1530 for lunch at the Beekman site. The agent was not seen entering
or leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought

The implication was_that AMCLOCK/1 was still under observation by the
JAMTHUG regime and(iden C’actually told him to bend backwards in every

way possible to prove himself while in New York. AMCLOCK/1 explained
that this meant to live a model life while abroad and to perform extra
work whenever required, without complaining. AMCLOCK/1 believes that

AMCLOCK/1 could not come out with any clear indication that he was
suspected or was falling out of ‘grace with the AMTHUG regime. Although
the agent has a tendency to emphasize his "delicate" position, the
case officer believes that he is not mistrusted and still enjoys a
favorable position in the government, although probably considered too
bourgeois to be completely integrated with their communist philosophy.

appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned y
about it. However, if this is ‘true the chances for AMCLOCK/1 to be
reassigned abroad in the near future appear doubtful at this time.

4. When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the
recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following
information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his
return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during
which time he went by the ministry from time to time but had no job
assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to
relocate in his new home furnished by the PBRUMEN government. In the

takes] But AMCLOCK/1 avoided the position although it implied frequent
(fravels abroad. The reason AMCLOCK/1 gave for not taking the position,
at Gden Py was that he did not want to break away from his diplomatic
career an@ felt he would be better protected among his frsends in they
