Mrs. Moore Interview...page 3

Mrs. M:

Well, while we was standing there- we was waiting

for the motorcade - the motorcade came up Houston Street, turned

directly in front of us, and started down Elm Street. And while

we was standing there, the motorcade was real close to us, close

enough for us to reach out and touch but didn't anyone do this, and

by that time they passed by us, he waved to us, and by that time

we heard a shot.

We heard a noise, I'll say, and I said...and I

thought...I said, "Now what in the world is this backfiring a car

like right here now at this time?" And then I saw the President

when he kinda leaned over - like forward - he leaned forward.

And then after he leaned forward I heard a second shot. And then

when I heard the second shot, that's when Mrs. Kennedy stood up

and I could see all this when it fell.

Mr. D: When you say you could see all of this, you mean

you could...

Mrs. M: I could see his forehead. Seemed like this

whole forehead just fell down - fell down - 'cause when it hit

a knee this all of this just came down. And then I started

to screaming and everyone started to screaming and after that it

was utter chaos.

We all was running and running into each other

and knocking each other down, and Mrs. Kennedy was standing

straight up in the car. And the Secret Service man ran and he

jumped up in the car and he grabbed Mrs. Kennedy and pushed

her down and got in there on top of her. And then by this time

the motorcade had speeded up and had gone on underneath the

underpass and out of sight where you could see it.

Mrs. M: But all of this just - ooh - just came down.

Mr. M: Right. Now how many shots did you hear?

Mrs. M: I only heard two.

Mr. M: You heard two.

Mrs. M: Mm - and they came directly over our head. and :

we were standing directly in front of the book depository.

Mr. M: The direction you thought they came from was

directly over your head?

Mrs. M: Over our head, uh-huh.

Mr. M: Did you turn around?

Mrs. M: I turned around to see why was somebody backfiring

a

car.

Mr. M: Right. Did you look up?

Mrs. M: No, I didn't lo0k up, I just thought it was a car

backfiring.

Mr. M: And you heard the two shots?

Mrs. M: Heard two shots, yes.

Mr. M: Then you saw what you just related about the

President and his head.

Mrs.M: Yes, yes.

Mr. M: Now, you said you turned, everybody started running.

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr. M: Which way did you run?

Mrs. M: Ran back into the building.

Mr. M: You went back into your building?

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr.

M: Did you see anyone come out of the book depository?

Mrs. M: No, I - there was so many people there you couldn't

tell where they were coming from and they were all running in

different directions.

Mr. M: Right. Now you ran back into your building?

Mrs. M: Right.

Mr. M: Where did you go in your building?

Mrs. M: Up on the fifth floor and we standing - all of us

was standing there looking out of the window.

Mr. M: Right. Now you all ran back - just all your

co-workers?

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr. M: And you went back and you started looking out the

window.

Mrs. M: Window

Mr. M: And what did you see then?

Mrs. M:

Well, we saw people lying on the ground and the

police attending them, and people running, and cameras flashing,

and police running in and out of buildings and all around behind

the buildings.

Mr. M: You say you saw a lot of people running. Which

direction was most of the running in, do you know?

Mrs.M: They was running back up Elm Street or down Houston.

They didn't go toward where the motorcade was going; they were

going back from the motorcade.

Mr. M: Now you say a lot of cameras were flashing and...

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr. M: Did you - was anybody in your group take any pictures?

Mrs. M: No

Mr. M: Did anyone have any recorders at the time?

Mrs. M: Not at our group.

Mr. M:

That you know of?

Mrs. M: NO

Mr. M: Since that time, have you talked to anyone that you

know

that had taken any pictures at that time?

Mrs. M:

No. We didn't take any. I don't know of anyone

who'd taken any pictures, but I did see some pictures of us

standing on the corner there.

Mr. M:

Saw a picture of your group?

Mrs. M: Standing on the corner. I don't know...

Mr. M: Where did you see this picture?

Mrs. M: It was in the newspaper.

Mr. M: In the newspaper. Right. But all the people that

you know, no one took any pictures? That was just a newspaper

reporter that got the picture?

Mrs. M: Mm-hmm.

Mr. M: Right. Okay, now when you're looking out, did you

look into the book depository later on?

Mrs. M: No.

Mr. M: Or could you see into it?

Mrs. M: We could see into - see the windows. I didn't see

anyone in there.

Mrs. Moore Interview...page 7

Mr. M: Right.

Okay.

Mrs. M: I mean I

wasn't even looking because I didn't -

I wasn't thinking about the book depository.

Mr. M:

Right.

Mr. D:

Okay. Let me ask you a few questions now, Mrs. Moore.

Mrs. M:

Okay

Mr. D: Where did you think the noise came from when you

heard the first noise?

Mrs. M: I thought it was on the street behind us.

Mr. D: On the street

behind you?

Mrs. M: Mm-hmm.

See we were standing right on the corner

of the street and I thought it was in behind us.

MI. D: Let's get your location straight now. You were

standing in front of the book depository but across the street

where

the Dealey Plaza comes around, where they turned down.

You were right on that corner there, puts you on like right in

front of the book depository.

Mrs. M: Yeah, we was

standing right on the corner. The

building is on the corner and we was standing right in front of

the pository.

Mr. D: Okay, now when you say you thought the shot came

from the street behind you, do you mean the building behind you

or up that Houston Street, or what?

Mrs. M: I didn't think it was a shot. I thought a car was

backfiring.

DocId: 12266804 Page 10

## Page 11

:

Mr. Moore Interview.. page 8

Mr. D: Okay.

Alright. Now, let me ask you this. You said

you only heard two shots.

Mrs. M: Right

Mr. D: Alright. And you looked - did you look around -

trying to locate where the shot came from - or the backfires came

from?

Mrs. M: For the first time I did. I looked around and

commented to my friends: "Who'd backfireda car at a time like this?"

I said that. And then when I heard the second one - then I knew

it was

a shot because I could see the President had been hit.

Mr. D: Okay.

Now, the first shot you indicated that you

saw him go forward.

Mrs. M: He leaned forward, yes.

Mr. D: Alright. On the second one is when you saw his

head explode.

Mrs. M: Yes. It seemed like it was all this from his

forehead down -just looked like it was all dropped down.

Mr. D: Alright. Dropped down?

Mrs. M: Mm-hmm. Fell down. And that's when Mrs. Kennedy

jumped up and started to scream.

Mr. D: Alright. And could you hear her screaming?

Mrs. M:

No.

But I could tell she was screaming by her

mouth and how she was...

Mr. D: Okay.

Now, did you hear anybody else in the

motorcade say anything as it was passing?

Mrs. M: NO

DocId: 32266804 Page 11

## Page 12

Mrs. Moore... page 9

Mr. D: Okay. In reference to the people who were riding

on the President's car - I'm talking about Secret Service men -

can you tell me about any of their actions?

Now I know you said

one man jumped on the back of the car where Mrs. Kennedy was.

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr. D: How about the other men - did they do anything? Did

any of them leave the car or did you see any of their actions?

Mrs.M: Well, when the first shot was fired - now that I

knew it was a shot (at first I thought it was a backfire) - well,

when they first, they were driving real slow, so slow that the

Secret Service men could walk along and hold onto the car. There

was one on each side, holding on to the back of the car. But when

the first shot was fired, the Secret Service men and someone on the

other side of the street over there by the Plaza, fell to the

ground. I don't know whether it was a man or a lady, but she

fell to the ground. The Secret Service man turned the car loose

and was looking over in that direction. And then when the second

shot came, they both ran - both of them was running - toward the

car.

They had to run to catch the car.

Mr. D: Toward the car?

Mrs. M: Yeah. When the second shot came, the Secret Service

men started running toward the President's car and one jumped up

into the car and the other one was on the side. Seemed like he

was running along the side but then the car speeded up and he was

just there.

Doc1d: 32266804 Page 12

## Page 13

Mrs. Moore Interview...page 10

Mr. D: Did he go with the car when it speeded up, or did

he get in another car?

Mrs. M: I didn't see which way he went. I saw this only

one man get into the car over Mrs. Kennedy.

Mr. D: Okay, but the second man, you don't - you don't know

whether...

Mrs. M: Unh-unh. After he ran up to on the side of the car

and the car speeded away, I don't know which way he went.

Mr. D: Okay, now when you say somebody fell down, are you

talking about over on the side of the Plaza where you were

standing - on that grassy area?

Mrs. M: No, I'm

talking across the street from where I was

standing.

Mr. D: On the other side?

Mrs. M: On the other side of the street.

Someone fell down when we heard the first noise. Someone fell

down. And when they fell down, the Secret Service men as well

as the police were all looking in that direction and they had

turned loose of the car and of course the car was moving on.

Mr. D: Okay, now you're saying...can you explain that on

there?

Mr.

M: Now here is a location chart of Dealey Plaza.

This is the book depository. Where were you standing here?

This is the book depository right here. This is the...

Mr. D: We're gonna take a short break.

DocId: 32266804 Page 13

## Page 14

Mrs. Moore Interview.. page 11

Mr. D: The reason for the break was Investigator Maxwell

just showed Mrs. Moore a map of the Dealey Plaza area and it's

marked Äppendix No. A, and at that time Mrs. Moore pointed out to

us exactly where

she was in relation to the book depository and

the grassy knoll and the statue on the opposite side of the

street in the grassy knoll area. Now we can continue from here.

Mr. M:

That party that fell down - did you ever see them

get up again?

Mrs. M: No, I didn't.

Mr. M:

Did anyone go to their aid?

Mrs. M: Yes. The people standing there was gathered around.

Mr. M: Alright. Now, I talked to Mrs. VanZandt and she

indicated that she saw a car pull in to Houston Street - somewhere

around in here.

Mrs. M: Yes.

Mr. M: Did you see that car?

15%

Mrs. M: Yes, I did.

Mr. M: Right. What did the car do

what you saw?

Mrs. M: Well, at that time. Elm Street was a two-way street

so it came down Elm Street going toward the book depository. It

was driving real slow. Now we couldn't see the car while it was

in front of us, but when it came down on the side where we were

looking out the side window, you could see this car. It was a

black truck and it had lots of writing on it and the truck had

"Jack Ruby and Honest Joe" and I remember saying to one of my

coworkers:

"What in the world is Honest Joe doing out in the

DocId:32266804 Page 14

## Page 15

Mrs. Moore Interview...page 12

middle of the street in a time like this?"

Mr. M: And it also had "Jack Ruby" on it?

Mrs. M: Yeah, it had "Jack Ruby" written on there and

"Honest Joe" and we thought, I said, "Well, that must be the

same person." I remember thinking to myself, "Jack Ruby and Honest

Joe must be the same person' and he came on down and to the

intersection of Elm

and Houston Street and he pulled into the

intersection and he just sit there. I didn't see this person.

I just saw a man with a hat on, but I didn't actually see him

'cause I wasn't paying that any attention. But he had - I saw

a man with a hat on sitting in this truck. And he drove down into

the intersection of Houston and Elm Street and he sit there for

maybe about two minutes and then he turn and he went down Houston

Street in the direction the motorcade would - was to come.

Mr. M: Right. Now you said it said "Jack Ruby." Did it said

Jack - anything else - besides "Honest Joe and Jack Ruby"?

Mrs. M: Yeah. Yeah, he had "tools," lotta words like "tools,"

and things like, on that order.

Mr. D: Could you describe the car to me - or the truck to

me?

Mrs. M: To me it was a black - it was just a black pickup

truck and it just had all this writing on it, and the writing was

some white and some red, and it was on this black truck.

Mr. D: Are you sure it was a truck?

Mrs. M: Yeah, I'm just positive it was a truck.

Mr. M: And did you also see a car maybe?

Dorld: 32266801 Page 15

## Page 16

Mrs. Moore. Interview...page 13

Mrs. M:

No, I didn't see a car, I just saw this one truck:

that was in the direction of the motorcade - and we wondered why.

Mr. D: Now, was this before the motorcade came or after?

Mrs. M: Before

Mr. D: Before the motorcade came down. Did you see the

truck anymore?

Mrs. M: No, not after he went down Houston Street. He

disappeared behind the building there and I saw him no more.

Mr. M: And how long after the truck disappeared did the

motorcade come along?

Mrs. M: Well, it must have been about - I say about- .15

minutes 'cause it wasn't our lunchtime yet. We looking out of the

window when we saw.

Mr. M:

Oh, you saw this from the window?

Mrs. M: Window. Yeah, we was looking out of the window.

Mr. D: This was before you came down on the corner.

Mrs. M: Before we came down to lunch, uh-huh.

Mr. M: And you saw it said "Jack Ruby and Honest Joe"?

Mrs. M: "Honest Joe," "tools"...

Mr.

M:

Right. Okay, did you know Jack Ruby?

Mrs. M: No.

Mr. M: Had you ever heard that - saw that - name before?

Mrs. M: Never heard the name before and never had no

connection with the President at all with Jack Ruby:

## Page 17

Mr. M: Alright. Now after the incident with Ruby and

Oswald, do you recall that you had seen it on the truck?

Mrs. M:

Yes.

But that's when we somehow know that was -

have connection.

Mr. M:

Right.

Mr. D: In reference to the people that were standing on

the corner with you, can you tell me again what their names were

and if you know their addresses?

Mrs. M: I don't know 'cause see we don't work together

anymore.

we all work at different places, so I don't really

know. I remember their names, but I don't know their addresses.

Mr. D: Alright. Have you seen any of them recently?

Mrs. M: Yes. I see Ms. VanZandt and I see Gene and

Gertrude Fowler.

Mr. D:

Gene and

Gertrude Fowler?

Mrs. M:

Mr. D: Would you happen to know where they live?

Mrs. M: No, because they moved lately and they bought !em a new

home and Idon't know where.

Mr.D: Okay. In reference to where you worked, can you

explain to me where that building is in reference to the book

depository?

Mrs. M: They're

on Elm Street. The front of the both

buildings face Elm Street. Houston Street runs between the two

buildings and they each on the corner.

Where I worked was 501 Elm

Street. It was on the corner of Houston and Elm. And across

Houston Street, the book depository was right on that corner.

Mr. D: Alright. Is that the building that is presently

the Kennedy museum? Do you know?

Mrs. M: I think they're gonna turn it into the museum, yes.

Mr. D: As I understand it you worked on the fifth floor.

Mrs. M: Right

Mr. D: In a dress or garment factory.

Mrs. M: Right

Mr. D: Alright. Incidentally, let me ask - did you ever

know a lady by the name of Lopez?

Mrs. M: (reply unintelligible)

Mr. D: Alright. Do you know some of the people that were

standing on the fifth floor with you?

Mrs. M:

Yes, all my co-workers.

Mr. D: Are they the same people that you named...

Do you know if he's still in the

Dallas area?

Mrs. M: Yes.

He has a business. When we moved from Elm Street,

still there.

Mr. D: Is that where he is now?

Mrs. M: Mm-hmm

Mr. D: 1801 LaMar - L-a-m-a-r. And that's in Dallas?

Mrs. M: Yes.

Mr. D: Now, do you remember some ladies working up there -

possibly sisters - and possibly Mexican or Spanish-type people:

that worked in that building also on the fifth floor in that -

probably two sisters or three sisters?

Mrs. M: Well, now, it was Spanish people there, but I

don't know whether they were

sisters or not.

Mr. D: Alright. Okay. Now, as far as the building is

concerned, when you look out of your window, you're looking

at the side of the book depository. Right?

Mrs. M: Right.

Mr. D: The shipping area is back to your right and the

front door is on the left.- if you're standing on the fifth

floor looking out at the book depository.

Is that correct?

Mrs. M: Yes, we were all at the window.

Mr. D: Alright. And when you say "all," how many are you

talking about - five, six, ten people - or more than that?

Mrs. M: It's more than that 'cause more of us worked there

- I haven't called any of the

white people that worked there - there's a lot of those

all what I told you were black.

Mr. D: Right.

Mrs. M: But there was a lot of white women work there.

Mr. D: Now this was before the motorcade came down?

Mrs. M: What was? Well now, we saw the - Jack Ruby's truck?

Mr. D: Right.

Mrs. M: Right. "

Mr. D: And while you were standing in the window...

Mrs. M:

Now, they weren't looking out then. Now we could

stand at the window - where we stood at the window and worked -

we could look out of the window.

Mr. D: Oh, I see, un-huh. You hadn't taken your lunch

break then?

Mrs. M: No, we wasn't on lunch break.

Okay.

Mr. M: When you saw this truck, did you think the truck -

that was odd?

Mrs.M:

We thought it was odd because there were no other

cars on the street.

Mr. M:

Everything had been stopped by the police?

Mrs. M:

Everything...yes.

Mr. M:

Right. And this truck came through.

Mrs. M: Through - right.

Mr.M: Did you see anyone get out of the truck?

Mrs. M: No, he didn't get out.

Mr. M:

Or anyone get in?

Mrs. M: No, he didn't get in.

Mr. M: Now, is there anything else that happened at that

time that you might think would be suspicious, or caught, you know,

your eye, that you thought maybe was odd?

Mrs. M: No, there's just that one truck came down Elm Street,

paused in the intersection there for about two minutes, and then

turned and went down Houston and disappeared behind the building.

Mr. M:

Right. Now when the motorcade came up Houston Street

and before it - as it was making the turn in here, did one

Mr. M: You didn't see anything. Okay.

Mr. D: Let me ask you in reference to some photographs

as we talked about a little earlier. As I understand it, nobody

in your group that you know of took any pictures?

Mrs. M: NO

Mr. D: Did anybody else that you know of take any

photographs down there?

Mrs. M: NO

Mr. D: Alright. Other than what you saw in the newspaper,

have you seen any photographs of that day and down there at

that time?

Mrs. M: No, it just only if it came out in the newspaper.

It came out in the Life

And, of course, the magazine that day.

Magazine. All this whole thing came out in Life Magazine.

Mr. D: Okay. Now, were there any movie cameras, radio

trucks or television station trucks, things, that you saw in that

area that date?

Mrs. M: Well, I didn't see anything. - I didn't see anything.

Mr. D: Alright. How about in the book depository - did

you know anybody that worked in there?

Mrs. M: Yes, I knew - well, not actually knew him - I

knew Vanzandt. He's her cousin.

Mr. D: Alright. Did you see him that date?

Mrs. M: No,I did not see him.

corner in that area

there that you can recall?

Mrs. M:

I don't think - I don't know of anything ever

than what actually happened - the President getting shot.

Mr. D: Okay, alright.

Mr. M: Now after all this was over and you ran upstairs

to - back to the factory - you and your co-workers and you found

out that the President was killed and everything, right-- you all

talked it over a little bit?

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr. M: Right. During that conversation, did anyone in

that group or anything say that they knew Oswald - or they knew ruby?

Mrs. M: No - 'cause those names never - we didn't even know

the names.

Mr. M: After the names came out?

Mrs. M: No

Mr. M: When you discussed it after - what did you all talk

about?

Mrs. M: Naturally we discussed why was Ruby there but we

didn't do this until after Oswald was killed.

Mr. M: Right.::

Mr. D: I didn't understand that. Would you...

Mr. M: The following Sunday...

Mrs. M: Well, we discussed why Ruby was - wonder why he

was there. But we didn't do this until after Oswald was killed.

And then we had this connection between Oswald and Ruby. Other

than that, we just thought he was down there looking like we were.

Mr. D: Alright. Did you see Ruby?

Mrs. M: I saw a man in a truck, but I couldn't identify him.

He had on this dark grey hat...

Mr. D: Alright

Mrs. M: ...and he was in the truck.

Mr. D: Alright, let me clear this up. Now you are saying

you don't understand why ruby was down there, but you're meaning

that you don't understand why the truck was there, or you don't

understand why the man was there, because if you didn't know

who was in the truck you couldn't say Ruby was there - unless you

know Ruby.

Mrs. M: No, we didn't know Ruby.

Mr. D: Okay, but you just didn't understand...

Mrs. M: ...but we assumed it was Ruby because he was driving

a truck with Ruby's name and Honest Joe written on it. And we

assumed it was Ruby. And we discussed this.

Mr. M: At the time you didn't know - that name didn't

mean anything?

Mrs. M: ...didn't mean anything.

Mr. M:

But, did you see that program on Sunday when Ruby

shot Oswald?

Mrs. M: Yeah, I saw the actual - when he actually shot him.

Mr. D: On television.

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr. M: Right. Now the following day was Monday - you

went to work. Right?

Mrs. M: Yes

Mr. M: And that's when your co-workers and you discussed the

fact that Ruby - the name Ruby now meant something to you?

Mrs. M: Meant. Yes, it did.

Mr. M: And you and your co-workers discussed this. And

you felt that there was some connection by that truck being there:

at that time?

Mrs.M: Yes, we did.

Mr. M: With Jack Ruby's name on it and Oswald.

Mrs. M: Yes, Oswald wasn't in this picture now. He didn't

get into the picture 'till after he got shot.

Mr. M: Right. That's

what I mean. But see, this is the

following Monday you're discussing this, right?

Mrs. M: Un-huh

Mr. M: Did anyone in that group say that they knew or

had ever heard of Oswald before? Or over the weekend had spoke

to anyone that knew Oswald?

Mrs. M: No, they did not.

Mr. M: Or they comment on the fact that here's the man

that killed the President was working right across the street

from you - or anything like that?

Mrs. M: If they did, I don't remember.

Mr. M: Right, Un-huh.

Mr. D: Have you - I know I've asked you this before .

we went on tape, but have you given a statement to any police

or any agency - should I say such as the FBI, the Secret Service,

the Dallas police, or anybody concerning this matter?

Mrs. M: No, I have not.

Mr. D: Alright.

Mrs. M: Of course, the police did search all of our cars

that evening, but...

Mr. M: Oh, your car was down zat the scene?

Mrs. M: Yeah, we have a parking lot behind the book

depository and that's where we parked. And after we weren't working

anyway, our boss told us we could go home. And when we went and

got our cars, 'cause we had already searched 'em and we knew wasn't

no one in the car. And, but when we would come around, we had to

come around in front of the depository to get out on the street,

and the police looked in our cars. Which I was very glad, because

I was a nervous wreck by now.

Mr.D: When you say looked in it you mean he checked the

back seat, the front seat - he didn't open the trunk or anything?

Mrs. M:

Yeah - and opened the trunk. We opened the trunk

for the police. They looked in and, of course, they looked in

at the inside of the car.

Mr. M: Did they say what they were looking for?

Mrs. M: No, but we knew what he was looking for.

Mr.

M: An individual - or possibly a weapon?

Mrs. Moore Interview.. page 24

Mrs. M: Un-huh, or possibly the murderer.

Mr. D:

How much longer was it after you - after the shooting -

that you went home? That you came to this point where the police

were checking?

Mrs. M: Well,I guess, I would say about - he probably

dismissed us about 2 o'clock, 'cause we weren't doing anything

amyway 'cause we have a 45-minute lunch break and then we never

"did go back - we were just standing at the window.

Mr. M: A lot of confusion?

Mrs. M: Yes, it was.

Mr. D: How about the book depository...were people coming

and going out of there - or were the doors still open? Were

people - you know - coming and going?

Mrs. M: I, I don't know. People was milling around - I

don't know whether they were either going in or out - but they

were milling around in front of the bookstore- but it was a lot

of people so you really couldn't tell.

MI. D: Alright.

Mr. M: Did you show Ms. Moore: that picture? Maybe in the

car?

MI. D: Yeah, I did.

Mr. M:

When you were downstairs on the curb, did you see

another car come through by any chance? Prior, just before the President

Mrs. M: No, only two motorcycle police came.

Mr. M: Did you, were you aware that someone had fainted

over there: or something?

Mrs. M: Yeah, nothing. I didn't see any kinda - anything

to distract you until the first shot came - which I thought was

a backfire.

Mr. M: Right.

Mr. D: I want to now show you a photograph and I'm gonna

ask you if this photograph looks familiar to you.

Mrs.M: Yes. Now the street corner looks

familiar, but

I don't remember the car.

Mr. D: Don't remember the car.

Mrs.M: No, I don't remember this car.

Mr. D: Okay. Could this car have been - possibly have been

the car you saw?

Mrs. M:

No, the car I saw had writing on it and it was not

a car, it was a truck.

Mr. D: Alright. Thank you very much. I've just shown: Mrs.

Moore a photograph of a Lasalle automobile with a great deal of

writing on it on a street in Dallas approaching McCann's

Department Store.

Mr. M: Is there anything that we haven't asked you that

you could think of that you might want to tell us about what

happened that day?..Or what maybe you heard later on?

Mrs. M: : I think that's about all I remember really, 'cause I -

it was real busy for a long while - but now it's faded away, you know?

Mr. M: Mm-hmm. Alright. Anything else, Clarence?

Mr. D: I can't think of anything else. I think we'll uh...

Mr. M:

...end this interview - at 7 p.m. Thanks a lot.
