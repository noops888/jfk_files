information contained in Miami teletype 12/28/63, which ac
related to the exact details of the departure plans E
preparatory to the raid are set forth in this report

in a very general and incomplete fashion in order: to

protect MM T-1, who is the only person, except Dr. : ~
ORLANDO BOSCH, who had knowledge of these details. These
details were furnished, however, immediately to U.S. i
Customs. Seizure of the boats in this case was greatly i
facilitated by MM T-1's information.

Although this office has done everything
possible to protect the identity of MM T-1, it is felt
that U.S. Customs is undoubtedly aware of his identity
but will do everything possible to protect MM T-1 in view of
the excellent relations existing between the U.S. Customs
and this office.

It is to be noted that the facts set forth in
this case should enable the U.S. Department of Justice
to give an opinion concerning prosecution. |
This report is being classified CONFIDENTIAL L

MM 105-2855
DETAILS:
AT MIAMI, FLORIDA
L. PREDICATION

: Previous information was reported by MM T=1,
an individual who has been involved in Cuban Revolutionary
activities directed against FIDEL CASTRO. of Cuba, that :
Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, head of the Movimiento Insurrecional
de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR), an anti-CASTRO
organization of Cuban exiles, has been planning another
bombing raid by plane against a target in Cuba.

BOSCH began making these plans during the

early part of December, 1963, and intended to make the
raid prior to Christmas, but encountered several obstacles
such as engine trouble and bad weather which necessitated
postponement. The purpose of the raid was to drop bombs
on oil installations at Nuevitas on the north coast of
Camaguey Province of Cuba. Investigation reflected that
BOSCH was utilizing the services of DANIEL ORLANDO RAMIREZ
DENIS, a Cuban exile, as the bomb expert responsible for
constructing a number. of homemade bombs to be used on the

. operation. Investigation also disclosed that BOSCH was
in close contact with WILLIAM JOHNSON, United States
citizen who resides in Miami and who has been previously
implicated in Cuban Revolutionary activities. JOHNSON
was reportedly making arrangements to secure a boat which
would be used in transporting the bombs and men from the -
Miami area to Bimini, British Bahamas, where the bombs
would be loaded on a plane and flown by Cuban pilot and
crew to a target in Cuba under cover of darkness. It was
‘also reported that JOHNSON was negotiating with CHARLES BUSH,
a United States citizen who operates a charter plane business
at Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

-3- are

to obtain a plane for this raid. The plane was reportedly
scheduled to be flown from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini on a

* pleasure flight by a pilot who would be instructed te leave
the plane at the Bimini Airport overnight, check into a
hotel, and then return the plane to Miami the following day.
However, at approximately 1:00 AM, this plane was to have
departed Bimini under cover of darkness with a Cuban pilot,
crew and bombs. The bombs were to be dropped on the oil
installations at Nuevitas, Cuba, at about 3:00 AM and the
plane would return to Bimini at approximately 6:00 AM.
The plane was to have been left in the, same location
where the Cuban crew had taken possession of the plane and the
Cuban pilot and crew would depart Bimini still under
the cover of darkness for Miami in their boat.

It is to be noted that the airport at Bimini
is on a small island adjacent to the town of Bimini
and the airport is normally not manned by any airport
personnel after nightfall.

MM T-1 learned that BOSCH had secured the
services of EVELIO ALPIZAR PEREZ, a former Cuban Air
Force pilot to fly the plane on this raid.

MM T-1 also reported that during the course

of these preparations for the raid, Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH
y paid WILLIAM JOHNSON the sum of $450. 00 to obtain a

suitable airplane for the raid. JOHNSON then entered into”
the negotiations with CHARLES BUSH who first made available :
an Aero Commander, but this plane developed motor trouble
and BUSH then provided a Piper Aztec, Registration N4811-F, .
based at Broward International Airport. '

Inspector, Federal Aviation Administration, Miami, advised
that Piper Aztec N4811-P was leased by CHARLES BUSH in
April, 1963, from the Fleet Rental Leasing Corpaation, Post

that BUSH had undertaken to secure the services of a-pilot
in flying this plane from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini~on
the date when the plane was needed there. BUSH also gave

prior to the scheduled bombing raid.

IL. INVESTIGATION

On December 27, 1963, MM T-1 advised that Dr,
BOSCH had made final preparations and had scheduled
departure plans for the raid to begin on December 28,
1963. MM T-1 verified that the larger of the two boats
to be used was the "Ebb Tide", a 28 foot sport fishing
boat with a flying bridge docked at Baker's Haulover.
It is to be noted that U.S. Customs Service, Miami,
had already placed this boat under surveillance as the
suspect boat in this case. MM T-l- said that the "Ebb
Tide," with a Cuban captain aboard, was scheduled to
‘ rendezvous with a smaller boat at about 6:00 PM on
December 28, 1963, at a point several miles east of
Government Cut and South Miami Beach. The personnel
scheduled to participate in the raid would then proceed
| to Bimini according to plans, transporting with them
" the bombs forthe raid on the night of December 28-29,1963.

MM T-1 also advised that the Piper Aztec,
| N4811-P, was scheduled to depart on the afternoon of
‘ December 28, 1963, for Bimini in accordance with the plan.
MM T-1 did not know the identity of the pilot. .

The details of this plan were immediately

furnished to the U.S. Customs Agency Service and other
interested agencies.
