and further recalled that DRISCOLL once left a note signed

by BECK for collection with GILBERT. From the description

of the alleged third gambler who pays frequent visits to

GILBERT in the bank, GILBERT identified this man as s. C.

"CHICK" FLOURNOY (Dallas file 162-164) • He stated

FLOURNOY has a loan on the books at the bank. He identified

FRED MERRILL (Dallas file 166-81) as a person he has known

for years and with whom he used to gamble when MERRILL

operated a house in Rockwall County. He stated that many

years ago he used to keep MERRILL'S

books. He further

admitted he was acquainted with gambler JOHN BENTON TURNS.

GILBERT was quite vague about details throughout

the interview but after the possible violations under the

federal anti-gambling and conspiracy statutes were explained

to him he became quite upset.

He advised it appeared to

him he was being used by these gamblers in their financial

transactions.

He stated he would cooperate with the FBI

in any way possible.

He stated he would give the matter

considerable thought and attempt to remember specific

details concerning financial transactions of these gamblers

and would keep the FBI advised of any future transactions

and activities. It is the opinion of the Dallas Office that

GILBERT can be of great value in this investigation if he

is placed in a position where he will cooperate with the

Bureau.
