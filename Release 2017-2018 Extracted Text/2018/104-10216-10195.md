MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT * Silencer for the FAL Automatic
Rifle.

REFERENCE: + ยง& May 1964 Conversation between
Nestor Sanchez and the undersigned.

1, On 5 May 1964 ur. of T8D was called,
and @ request for FAL silencers was made with the following
specifications:

1. Three were needed on a crash basis.

2. The silencer, if possible, was to be designed
in such a manner that it could be adapted to
any standard FAL automatic rifle (light barrel)
without modification to the rifle itself,

S. In addition to the above three silencers TSD
was to check the ease and cost of procuring
25 to 50 such silencers.

4. The silencer in addition to limiting the
explosive noise from firing would also have
to eliminate the sonic boom connected vith
the standard FAL round. Furthermore, this would
have to be done through the silencer itself
rather than through a new type ammunition for
the FAL that had a mzzie velocity less than
the speed of sound.

2. A preliminary report was received from TSD the
afternoon of 5 May 1964 stating the following:

1, Things looked hopeful, and a detailed preliminary
report would be forwarded to the undersigned
prior to the close of business 8 May 1964,

2. It appeared the silencer would be a unit
that would include both the silencer per se,
and a rifle barrel (this would fit a
Standard FAL automatic rifle - light barrel
modei) modified to reduce the muzzle velocity
of the standard FAL round to leas than the
Speed of sound, thus eliminating the sonic

3. This project, if successful, will provide a
Gilencer that can be used on any standard
VAL automatic rifle (light barrel). It will
continue to fire a standard FAL round with a
Silencing effect that vould eliminate to the
barest minimum, both the noise from the
explosion of firing the bullet, and the noise
created by a bullets muzzle velocity that is
@reater than the speed of sound.
