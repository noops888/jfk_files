Meeting with Lay Adolphoyich ARON SONISDOMINIQUEL TINE

890 8a

Vaually discreet about his/freequent/meetings with Soviet

vIgitors to Francer, Aronson told me today quite a number

of thinge on his latest encountere with them. So first he

said he spent an evening with Mrs Biasheva - a theatrical

critic from loningrad. It is not the first time he met her,

so she told him "that for the moment in leningrad is quite

a diffioult oppressive atmosphere," "that the intellectuals

have more difficultieg than ever

and once, talking about the

Ichecoslovaquia events Mrs B. told Aronson : "please do not

attribute to us the opinions expressed by Literatournaya

Gazeta - we the intellectuals of Leningrad were dead opposed

to it/the invasion/".

From other meetinga Aronson had lately with Soviet visitors,

namely one correspondent of "Izvestia", he got also impres

sion of a partioulary tight "zajim"/ turn of the screw which

18 felt presontly in USSR, especially In both capitala. then

ho said,he got the impression that in USSR the intellectuala

find themsolves more and nore isolated from ordinary people

which, undor the aotion of now directives given by the autho

ritios bocomes "hoetile toward them". What are these new in

structions given by the sov authoritied ? - "To spy each

other and particulary the intellectuals/whom one cannot trust

to fight foreign influende and manners, to be proud of thoir

great comm. party, to become true proletarians"

"Apparently

said Aronson the party turns now toward the "bage", toward

the lower layere of

the population in order to find thero

support againat the upper circles of the population who are

fed up with the régime".The new diroctives, Aronson told, bore

fruit particulary in Moscow, where according to all his inter

locutors population becane lately hostile toward the forei

gners and toward their own intelloctuala.Also people in the

stroet, in the shop became particulary rough and unpleasant.

Everyone uses "unprintable" expressions, which spread also

among the youth and in the scools.

Aronson related also about the vening he spent recently with

the firet Secretary of the Bulgarian Embassy, who with his

wife were guents of Aronson in his restaurant. "Contrary to

what I expeoted - said Aronson - 1t turned out that thia Bul

garian diplomat is definitelly anti-communist minded, and 18

set against the Soviet Union".

"It surprised me so more,as

the First Secretary is a particulary truated and powerful

figure".I asked Mr. Aronson if this attitude of the Bulgarian

Secretary was not intended in some provocative purgose.so

Aronson replied that he did not think so: because

Bulga

rian diplomat had no reaso to provoque him. Aronson noticed

algo that the Bulgarian diplomat expressed admiration for

all of those theatrical authore which usually are particula

ry hated by the communists. When Bronson asked him about the

theatre in sophia and if they could produce there such playe

My comments: Two points in the statements of Aronson call

attention: First about the "new instructions

and directiveg" given in USSR and Second :

about the anti-communist dispositiong

of the

First Secretary of the

Bulgarian Embassy in

Paris./II the later 1s true, 1t could be quite

a "possibility"/.
