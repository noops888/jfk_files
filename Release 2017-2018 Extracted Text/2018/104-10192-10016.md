RAY wes unable to tee a decent job after bis dismissal
vy,Castro, and he vas under constant surveillance that
practically amounted to house arrest. In spite of Castro's
precautions, hovever, RAY maintained contact with the MRR
and, through members of that group, with anti-Castro movee
wents in and out of Cubs. By 3 June 1960, after be had
Decowe nearly destitute because of the impossibility of
exploynent, RAY's follovers and associates began to plan
bie exfiltration from Cuba 80 that be could become a more
effective rallying point for anti-Castro movements in exile.

RAY, bovever, decided to remain in Cubs and participate
directly in clandestine activities against Castro. He
Joined a group called Accion Democratica Revoluctonaria (ADR)

and soon became one of its leaders, The ADR appears to be

the first organisation of its kind vbich can be considered
®& serious threat to Castro's regime, and has been the target
of several overtures from the FRD to Join forces, One of

the primary reasons for the ADR's attractiveness is RAY's

connection with it.
