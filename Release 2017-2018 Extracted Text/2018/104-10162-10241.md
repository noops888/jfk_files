Reference:

2749 dated 11 April 1969

Even though we have maintained ASLANYARD for &

considerablo length of time, we have not been able to

establish a pattern of activity for Asboor.

The cause

of thia lack 1a quite simplo:

AELANYARD lag been main

tained more or loss on a working hour schedule, 1.0..

cron roughly 0800 to 1200 houre with occasional additional

night monstoring. Roalladir this, wo docidod to carry

out a two wook operation whereby wo uno! diflorent equip

ment.

Wo will conne this phase of the operation since we

now have, we believe, sufficiont coverage to establish

the pattern of activity of ASBOOR.

The operation has proved very holpful. We now

know that on two occasiona AEBOOR did no. return home

until live or nix in the morning.

Mrs. ARBOOR on one

oocanion inunched into him comanding to know where he had

beon, etc.

His serly was "I have been working" and nothing

more.

We

forward under separate cover a copy of the

pertinent tranoript involved in thim discumion.

Our next stop mininet ABBOOR ie to mount via

Ho apologled that his wife could not make it that evening because

she had to stound a "conmand perfonrance". Although Subject claim: to be

accupt & drink (Seotch) and thou proceeded to chat about varioue inconsequential

ensued. LiVERONE offored to prepare some Shashlik and Subject stated that

it was ond of the favorite dishes of his wife. He surgested that perlaps

he could pick her up aftor tha "cormand perfumance" and bring her to the

apartmont.

Thie was readily agreed to but since there was an hour and

a half romaining before Subject could fetch his wife, we consinued with

goneral sonveragiln.

The followish: puints concerning Sub lect's past

1958 and that during this time he had had a chance to travel freely

and one something of the country. The pouple wore friendlier, politer

withheld simply because he was a Soviet. If the latter were

the ense, he said he would raise the question with the President

of the United States (who was visiting Muxico at the timo and

was going

a result of this throat the visa was losued almost Inmedlately.

Due to completely fortultous circumstances, subject and three

other Soviet correspondents met in Now fork on thu 4th of July.

LNERGO allegedly becane excited about the presunce of four Soviet

corrospondents in New York at one time and carrled un a very

the notes complled for books on latin Amerlen wore stolen from

Subjoct and as a result his literary ambitiona have not boun

realized.

•, Subjuct stated

that he has a Ih-year old son in Moscow and

although they mics the boy, there are no adequate schoola in

Argentina. This 1a the reason for the separation. In Mexico

tho Soviet Embassy hau provision for the three primary prades.

That is whore subject's son started his schooling.

2. At 2130 hours Subjoct loft topick up hie wife Buying he would be

Once we had boon forced to temporarily withdraw

nocupid the apartment on 27 January, we

obtainod through BIOGENESIS the bluoprints of the target

apartmont and the apartmonts which abutted.

A study of

thoso bluoprints shows that the apartment belonging to

tho woalthy coopurative neighbor has a maid's room which

sharos the wall of the living room of L

apartmont.

Wo pointed this out to BIOGENESIS and suggested

that they

onlist tho further cooporntion of the owner in

ordor that a microphone could be installed through the

common wall.

Untortunatoly the owner had departed for

soverr) wooks leave.

Tho owner should be back in

this timo and wo havo instructed DIOGENFSIS to approach

him again and to movo on

with tho oporation.. We are also

presently working on an LP.

Wo shall koop you advined of our progross in

this oporation.
