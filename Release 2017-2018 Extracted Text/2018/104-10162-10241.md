Reference: HABA-20512, dated 25 April 1969

1, Reference dispatch described our efforts against AEBOOR
and stated that the next phase would conaint of a 24 hour a day
gurveillance of Subject for a period of about two weoks, The
coverage was initiated at 0600 hours on 19 Moy, and terminated

a 15)5 hours on 26 May, the day of AEBOOR's departure for home \
ave,

2. The overall roaults of the surveillance effort were
interesting, and provided us with o great deal of basia data which ‘
should prove valuable in futuro AEBOOR operational planning.

Although tho period covered must bo viewed as somewhat atypical
‘@ince it covored a time of proparation for homo leave, thu basic
pattern could not have varied arcatly from the norm. Thore was
dofinite evasive action disigned to shake surveil
AEBOOR on several occasions; there wore repeat vii
establishmonta which could easily sorve as lotter dropr or con- zu
tact points; and there was an interonting contact-on 21 May 7 !
(roported in with an individual we failed to 7
identify positively,
- &. Although the above makes it appoar that we are approaching
-- -the-ASBOOR eration strictly frum the CI/CE wnyle, this 18 not
the case. We are attompting to gathor adequate information to
Clear insight into AEBOOR's activitios in ordor to holp
‘us attempt to introduce an access agont into thin operation, or
to Bapand direct development of Subject by Station officers,

Operational Possibilitios against AbbOOR

Reforonce: HCSW 7666, 11 February 1909

1, With the departure of ALUOUR and his wife on home Jaavo,

wo would like to ofYer a fow comments about him for possible future
action by the Stetion when he returns, ‘The impetus for these
thoughts was a recent examination of the files of atl those Soviets
on the priority target dst to determine if, porhaps, one of thom
offers more of a potential for intonsive developuent tnan anotier,
Tho purpose of this review was not to discurd tho agreod-upon targot
list, since this list is the rationale behind the entire concept

of soloctive targotting; but rather, to uttemp. aa cwiny, of the
Statlon's focus on tae one particular Soviet who appears to be the
best selection for operstional development among tho priority group.
We have looked of such factors os suscoptibilities (known or
potential) contacts, accossibility, etc. and, tor reasons discuscod
below, foal that ABOOR may be the beat selection for a duternined
Station effort mined et his eventual rocrudtmont, Thus, tho Station's
focus on the other priority Soviets would continue at its present
Rovel but at tho same time, ALBOUR would be placod "uncer the
microscope" as the object of a more intensive Station offort aimed
at gaining multiple accoss to him,

e With tho iominent departure of brpaNnnT/ad

again and instigate a second mecting soon after Subject
returns from home icave. Since there are no other access
Syents now in couche with Subject, th otential for assess-
ment of our target personality by direct Staffer contact
becomes crucial in the selective targotting procedure,
Through the advantages of direct assossment, wo should be
-able to mike n good judgment concerning the suscep ibilities
(or lack thereof) of ALBOOR and accordingly, determine the
valuo in pursuing him as a priority target.

b, The impressions of AKBOOR and his wife from the one
meeting thusfer seew to offer some possible avenues of approach
which the Station may wish to consider in their plunning. The
wife, in particular, was describod as being more relaxed than
AuBOSR and through her professed interest in theatre, music,
‘and ballet, it might be possible for Niua T, HARGANUL to
exploit this intorest and invite her to selected cultural
events 1f ALBOOR does not share his wite's proclivitios
for the "arts", thon sho might appreciate the prosenco of a
fonale anion who sha her interests. AbUUR's wite
@lso claimed ic like both Americen songs and dancin, This
t00, might open the door to some form of A
built around a future invitation whoreby
Felationship of 9 January would be further developed in the
depth needed for a thorough as: mont of the target. Cultie
vation of the wife appears to be particularly appropriate
because of the apparent conflicts and tensions between her
and her husband, ‘The accounts of this relationship from thar
Rrexious tour in Mexico and also the current transcripts from

LANYARD painta picture of an irascible and foul-mouthed
husband coustantly doing b e with ring wife. Jf.
seems Likely that the iapr on of "5! and Light” waica,
thoy generated during their evening with the Station case
officers w ogy ical end manufactured for tho benefit of ©
their hest by tn of course, is natural with most couples
who choose not to air their personal differences in public,
bue from our point of view, this lack of harmony betwe
ABBOOR and his wife offers distinct pusaibilities for
Btation te contact the wife independentiy and offer her welcene
diversions from the regimented and turbuicat Lite with
husband, © (We call your attention to the reference since it
may provide some useful puints in devising an approach to
ABBOOR's wife). Thair present home leave in the USSR would
seem vo offcs a readyemade situation for renewed contact when
they yveturn since natural curiosity about their activities
and tine spent at home covld be suificiont grounds for an
invitation cither to both or singly to spend an evening together
We offer those thoughts only becsuee they epyear ta ue as geod

a, AVDEPTHs The ability to monitor ALBOOR through this
technical operation was a key factor in deciding to bring him
under cioser focus, it should beable to provide the necessary
depth to any human assessment of the target and it gives us the
singular opportunity to “observe” AEBOUR when ho is relaxed at
home and not exhibiting the official mannurisms and personality
which Re must display in public and around his other Soviet
colleugues, If wo are able to expand the burgeoning Staffer
contact with Subjoct as well as place access agents in touch
with him, then his reactions te these contacts can be monitored
and our moves against him tailored accordingly.

3. AS part of the total effort to build up a large amount of
information on the selected kargets we are including es an attachnont,
& copy of the new Personality Characteristic questionnaire (PCQ) with
instructions for its use. ly employing it in conjunction with your
divect a ment of ALBOOR, we should be ab
onough information on him so that ti
ment techniqlcan a
time-consumin, is believe it should be an intepral part
of the entire mt process fucused on a target Soviot and thet
it cam be an invaluable aid in attempting to evaluate the varied
sions of the target which have been obtained from multiple
8 to him. An initial review of the PCQ may give the improssion
that many of the questions are irrelevant and have no bearing on the
determiuation of a persons susceptibility to manipulation. The
questionnaire shouta not be phe piecemeal, howover, but taken in
its entirety since each portion will be interpreted and weighted by
the -indirect. paychological sessment techniques until a very complete
impression of the total sonality emerges. We encourago the Station
to ucddize the PCQ and when sufficio:tly complete, forward it to
Headquarters for evaluation.

@. Once again, we wish to emphasize that lleadquarters is in @

sition to of. guidance and support to your efforts, but the x

izcetion of the case rests with the Station, The ¢

1. Even though we have maintained AELANYARD for @
considerable length of time, we have not been able to
eataplish a pattern of activity for ABBOOR, The cause
of this lack is quite simple: AELANYARD has been main=
tained more or less on a working hour schedule, 4.0.,
from roughly 0800 to 2z00 hours with occasional additional
night monitoring, Realizing this, wo docidod to carry
out a two week operation whereby wo used difforent equip-
ment, Wo will ceage this phase of the cperution since we
now ‘have, we believe, sufticiont coverage to establish
.the pattern of activity ef AEBOOR.

know that on two occasions AEBOOR did nqi return hone
until five or fix in the morning. Mrs, AEBOOR on one
occasion launchad into him ¢omanding to know where he had

more. je forward under separate cover a copy of the
pertinent transoript involved in this discussion,

8. Our next stop againet AESOOR is to mount via
BIBAFFLE 0°24 hour surveillance of AEBCOR, It is our
int thought to continue this for up to two wouks;
however, wince ag many as 12 officers por duy will be
needed, the BIBAFFLEs wil’ be hard put to carry it out.
Other operations will have to suffer. since wo are vonvinced

Due to completely fortuitous circumstances, Subject and three
other Soviet correspondents met in New York on thy Ath of July.
LNERGO allegedly bucame excited allout the presunce of four Soviet
correspondents in New York at one time and carried on a very
tight surveillance which was quite onnoying, During thin time
the notes compiled for books on Latin America were stolen from
Subject and as a result his literary ambitions have not beun
realized.

@, Subject etated that he hos @ lbeyear old son in Moacow and
although they mics the boy, thare are no adequate achools in
Argentina. This io the reason for the separation, In Mexico
tho Soviet Embassy hay provision for the three primary grades.

tho fall of 1967 wo hogan o unilateral investigation and casing
of the apartmant thon occupied 1 enema | Our
undlateral investigation rovonled that the lock on the door
of this apartmont was a Trabex--a look which reqnires at a
minimum soveral hours of picking. Simultancous to our
Unilateral investigation wo loarnod of [______] planned
PCS departure, We also loasnod that the Soviets intended to
koop his apartmont and that it was toe be occupied by
roplacemont. In mid-January wo derided to send BIBAFFLE-3 to
tho apartmont building in order to botviend the portero. We
had hoped that the portoro would be able to furnish us with a
key to the apartment. On 25 January we learned that

was arriving in Buenos Airvm on 27 January. Un-
fortunately timo had run out on ws, We therefore decided to J
turn to BIOGENESIS.

\ “94° ‘Thore wore sevoral reasonn for this decision. First
lof all. we do not doubt tho operational value of having an

and ot times risky operation, Considering this and matching

3, As Oxpiained in Rexarence A we briefed BIOGENESIS
in the carly afternoon of 25 January. BIOGENESIS immediately
issved instructions that the portero of tho building be
approachod, This was accomplished Successtully in the
late afternoon of tho samo diy, Unfortunately the rtero
did not have a koy, The sam: night a BIOGENESIS team oF

: three (including BIBAFFLE-3 nnd BIOGENESIS-14) attempted

7 in vain to pick the lock, In the course of this lock~

4 picking exorcise PIBAYFLE-3 had to identify BIOGENESIS
interest in tho apartment to the ownor of tho neighboring
apartmont, Fortunately this individual is wealthy and
was cooperative,

4. Once we had been forced to temporarily withdraw
occupied the apartment on 27 January), we

obtained through BIOGENESIS the bluoprints of the target
apartment and tho apartments which abutted. A study of
these bluoprints shows that the apartment belonging to
tho woalthy coopsrative neighbor has a_maid‘s room which
sharos tho wall of the living room of a |
apartmont. We pointed this out to BIOGENESIS and suggested
that they onlist the further cooporntion of the owner in
ordor that a microphone could be installed through the
common wall. Unfortunately the owner had departed for
severnl wooks leave.

8. Tho owner should be back in| at
this timo and wo havo instructed BIOGENFSIS to approach
him again and to move on with the ogoration,. We are also
presently working on an LP, i : o
