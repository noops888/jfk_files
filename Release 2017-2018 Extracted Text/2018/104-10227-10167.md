Dear 517:

Information has been recelvod that a committee le elrculating

appeale to

the Canadian people asking for contributione for drugs

cos rofuses to purchase sugar.

mia, to pla, ova ben it it in sa.

The committee la called the Medio

cal Ald to Cuba Committee, Sentlon D. P. O, Box 4, Toronto 2B, =

Ontario.

As a member of the Cuban exile communicy and one Intimato:

ly informed of the oltuation in Cuba, 1 sliould like to sot thio matter

otralpht and poinê out the fallacy of this supposedly humanitariao

work which may be victimising the Canadian people.

the economie pollelea of the Cuban guiernment, which prefera lo put its

than Into lood and druge for lia people.

The alleged argument that the cutting off of eugar purchases

by the United States has prevented the purchase of druge la fallacious

since the Cuban Government boasta of lta considerable sale of sugar

to the Sovlot Undon which prides: lteolf on its eclentifle progreso. =

With thie foreign eschange available for Cuba, la the Soviet Union -

unable, or la lt unwilling to send druge to Caba?

Fristhermoro, Fresident Konnedy has specifically stated that -

there would be no

total embargo pluced on Cuba aa ho lotended that

food and medietnes be sent to Cuba since he had no quarrel with the

Cuban people but only with their Communial dominated government.

There la ample exchange available to Cuba, for examplo from Bremen

dona salon of tobacco to the United States.

Moreover druge aro being

sent to Cuba.
