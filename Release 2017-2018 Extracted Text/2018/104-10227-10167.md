Dear Sirt

Information haa been received that a committee to circulating
appeals to the Canadian pedple asking for contributions for drugs =

. to be sent to Cuba, implying that supplies have been cut off and «

that the Cuban people cannot get such drugs because the United Sta
tes rofuses to purchase sugar. The committee ie called the Medi-*
cal Aid to Cubs Committee, Station B, P. O, Box 4, Toronto. 2B, -
Ontario,

A8 a member of the Cuban: exile communisy and one intimates
ly informed of tho cituation in Cuba, I sliould Iiké to set thia matter
straight and point out the fallacy of this supposedly humanitarian -
work which may be victimizing the Canadian people,

The hypocrisy of this appeal ie, ovidént to anyone who has studied
the economic policiéa of the Cuban government, which prefers to put ite
avallable foreign exchange intc the purchase of guns and tanks rather
than into food and drugs for its people.

Tho alleged argument that the cutting off of sugar purchase:
by tho United Stites hae prevented the purchase of drugs 1s fallacious
eince the Cuban Government boasts of its considerable sale of sugar
to the Soviet Union which prides: itsolf on its aclentific progress. =
With this foreign exchange available for Cuba, i the Soviet Union -
unable, oF is it unwilling to send drugs to Caba?

Furthermore, Fresident Kennedy has epeci{ically stated that -
there would be no total embargo pluced on Cuba aa he intended that
food and medicines be sent to Cuba since he had no quarrel with the
Cuban people but only with thelr Communist dominated government.
There is ample exchange available te Cuba, for example from tremen
dous sales of tobacco to the United States, Moreover drugs are being
jent to Cuba,

Let our friends the Canadiana not be victimized by thie propa-
ganda-type campaign but 6xamine calmly and carefully the motives. ©
behind the appeals being made by the Liedieal Ald to Cuba Commitice,

Sincerely yours,
