Mr. Randall:

According to telcon between Mr. Savige (Info & Priv) and

Mr. Johnson of Nat'1 Archives on 12 Dec 75, CIA apparently

needed to review for declassification of material on Lists

2. and 2A (see attachments) just the documents which

were

forwarded to us along with the lists by NARS. Mr. Paul

Hartman reviewed the documents (also attached and has made

appropriate notations for declassification.
