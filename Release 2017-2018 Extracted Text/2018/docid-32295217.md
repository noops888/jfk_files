COUFDENTA

NOTE: June 9, 1965, CIA furnished data indicating subjects were forning

a commando force in

Miami to be used by Dominican General Antonio

this regard. It appears that possibly the approach made by Belt

Ramirez may

have been

in connection with the same allegation and

Since his son is a PSI Che may be in a position to furnish worthwhile

information thereby saving investigative time and effort.
