in to colinento an operational plan for the

I. ASSUMPTIONS:

A. The Untted States Government will alre public

assurances that, provided no nuclear or offenalve weapore

present or re-introduced into Cuba, and provided Cubri deen

not ter action to threaten

the ponce and security of the

"estern hemisphere, the United Btates does not Intend to

B. Those assurances will preclude any meaningful CIA

action on a

phased basis to provoke a revolt inside Cube, since

unless there are major changes in operational and internal con-

ditione in Cuba, such a revolt if provoked would be totally.

destroyed by Cuban counteraction in a matter of hours or, at

FIO PORTAN

APer days unless supported by a mados United States

Military commitment. In additlon, the non-invasion assurances

as a practical natter will preclude invading Cuba on the pretext

of a contrived provocation such as an attack on Guantanamo.

C. CIA operations involving a high noise level and a

distinct element of attributability, particularly paramilitary,

guerrilla, and commando type operations will be unacceptable

as a matter of policy.

D. The Castro-communist rogime will remain in power for

¡the Indefinite future with its security and control apparatus

relatively intaot and with the capability not only of crushing

unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

conditions in Cuba Increasingly difficult. While it 18

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in

renoving the offensive weapons from Cuba mey

serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there ls as yet no hard

indication that the control of the Castro-communist regine over

Cuba has been substantially weakened.

The United States assurances of no Invasion and no

support ofian invasion will, in effect, constitute sivlug to

Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will.

difficult for un to recrult agents, maintain agents

efforts agalust Cuba and the Castro-communist regime.

This 1s an unreallatle objective, however, except. on a very

Long-term basto as the Valted States Goverment, no belleve,

wilt be unwilling in the immediate future to comult troops

to support such an overthrow. The United States Government

In 1ts overt dealings with the Cuban exiles probably 1ll not

express: the above factors to then in the context or with the

bluntnens stated here.

G.. In vlow of these lactors, the so-called "Track Tro"

course of action, 1.e., unluited support of Cuban exiles

and exile groups with no real control of objoctive purposes

In the hope that these groups will be sblo to shake the

Castro resine will although unrealistic, becone increasingly

attractive.at various levels in the United States Government.

I. As a matter of policy, polltical pressures and

economic pressures short of blockede, raids, and angressive

sabotago igninat Cuba will be continued.

In vien of the above sasumptions paramilitary, commando

and sabotage operations, except in rare selective instances

will serve little purpose; nlao they will be counter-producttve

"Inco, Il undertaken, they w1ll unke the collection of Intolli-

gence more difficult and should only be undertaken in those vory

fow lantances. where an unusually high return ern be demonstrnted.

Rosardless of what other pressures are placed on CIA for

action against Cuba, It would sppear clear that Higher Authnrity

Will insist on a contioued, even intensified, intelligence

coverage of Cuba.

In vlen of the policy lactors, an lucreased use of

facilitien, real estate and basing outaldo the United States,

particularly In' latin Americs, will be both necessary and

destrable:

E. Adequate aerial reconnaimaance of Cuba will continue.

II. OBJECTIVES:

Based on the above assumptions, the following objectiven

appear to be proper for continuing CIA operations against

Cuba:

A. Take all feasible clandestine action to isolate

and ansist in Isolating the Castro-communist regime In Cula

frow the rest of the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the

Free Horid.

Bo.

To the maximum extent possible, discredit the Castro-

communist regime in Cuba and in the Western Henisphere and the

rest of the world.

XXI. OPERATIONAL, PLAN:

A. Bapionage and Intelligence Colloction - All fereible

effort whould be undertoken to continue and Intensify intell-

gence collection concerning Cuba. The status of, our Intelll

sance collection and related operational actlulty at the

prement iime and its development during the past six monthe

1s delinested In detail in Attachment A, which man prepired to

serve as the basis for the il's report on this particular

antter to the President's Board of Consultante on Forelgn

Intelligence.

You will note that this lengthy document

bresks down under numerous sub-headings the intelligence

coverage which has been developed by the Clandestine Servire.

Set out below aro specifios of operational setion it 1s

proposod to take to continue and, as possible, Increase li-

telligence coverage of cuba.

1. Intolligence Exploitation of Refugees: As giu

know, with the quarantine and the cesantion of air

travel the beavy flow of Cuban refugees has dwlndled

almost to nothing. In vlew of this and in connection

---

## Page 8

with the contingency planning for mupporting any possible

mlltary notion in Cuba, the Opa-locke Interrogation

Center as such was dimmutled, although the personnel

of the Center have been retained intact. In order to

re establish. the flow of intelligence from refugees,

1t 1a proposed that Pen Anertoan Alrways and KIl be

Induced to reinstitute their regular flights fro

Havand to Miant. This should be done as soon a8

possible after the settlement of the current negotintlong

and UN discussions. Colncident with this, the Ope-locka

refugee interrogation center will be re-entablished

With the same personnel.

2. Resident Agente in Cuba: Every effort will be

made to continue to exploit to the tullest, premerve the

viability of and, where necessary, re-establish cormunten-

tons: with the 131 recruited agents now resident in Cuba.

To an extent, the spood and effectiveness of this effort

will of course depend upon the stringency of future

Cuban security and control setion, mich it 18 imposalble

as yet to accurately forecast.

3. Third Countsy Operations: The priority on rei

crutting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cuba

will be reiterated and strengthened and every effort

will be nade to facrease this coverage, both through

the developuent of additional resident agents in Cubs

be possible for NSA to reinstitute and perhaps even

Increase their seaborne intercopt coverage of Cuban

9. Communist Party Operations: A complete survey

has been made world-wide of and Comunist farty

penetration operations and wherever any such penetration

can be directed against Cuba either by dispatching the

sgent to Cuba or by pointing the agent arsinst Cubin

targets, this will be done, except in those cases whorn

such notion would reault in unneceptabloprejudice te

the operations in the aros where the agent is now baser.

It is bolleved that the most lucrative fleld for the

redirection of such operations to the Cuban targot will

be Lotin America where there are 65 penetrations of

varlous communist parties. Of this 65, the survey

we have conducted indicates that 23 have some dirert

pertinent access to Cuban targete. All oi these 27 mill

be directed against these targets unless in uny case

there are overridiag reasons to the contrary.

The

remalatos canos in the total of 85 are bein Indiridually

examined to see 11 they can be diverted to Cuban targete.

10. Illegally Infiltrated Agents: The two

muccessful black intiltrated teams (COBRA nad ANTORTID)

which have produced substantlal intelligence will be

continued, resupplied, and roinforced but pointed

prinarily at continued Intelligence collection and nt

the recrultuent for intelligence collection purposes of

othor Cubans who already are logally resident in Cuba

In the areas where the terme are operating (Piner del

Rio and Oriente). In nadition, on the most carefully.

selected basis, where it appeare feasible, auditional

agents and teans will be luffltrated black into Cuba

1n an effort to duplicate the performance of the COBRA

and ANTORRID teans and particularly to rocrult and, re

possible, train additional agents legally resident in

Cuba.

11. Exfiltration: As feasible, agents and potentirl

recruite now la Cuba will be exfiltrated for

•training, Indoctrtnation, supplying with communications,

and motivation. They will then be re-infiltrated into

Cuba, primarily on intolligence alesions, Were porsible,

this will be done through legal travel channels, but

where this 1s not posalble, it will be done wherever

feasible through our black infiltration-exfiltration

C. Sabotare: On the basis of the assumptions set out

above, commando type sabotage, minor sabotage, and other

acte of sabotage inside Cuba would appear to serve 11ttle

purpose and should not be undertaken excopt In the rare

D: Paramilitary, Commando, and GuerrIlle Type Operatloris:

Given the assumptions in Prragraph I above, no wide scale

program of such activity should be undertaken. However, we

propose to maintain in being our present facilitles and

the crabllity of undertaking such operatine la order to

"fully exploit any substantial change in internal Cuban con.

ditions or any mubstantial revolt or uprising which night recur.
