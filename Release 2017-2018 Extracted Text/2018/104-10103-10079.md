” MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Centrel Intelligence

THROUGH: i Deputy Director (Plena)

SUBJECT: Operational Pien for Continuing

Operstions Against Cube

3, Action: This memorandua is for. your information
and pursuant to your request. ‘Recommendations for action rre
conteined io Paregraph V below. The purpose of this memornodys

is to delineate an operational plnn for the action which we

‘believe whould be taken by CIA ogsinst Cub for the predictadls

_ future, In’ summary the plan provides for ecntinuing, even
” tntensitying, the intelligence effort sgeinst Cuba and for

the reorientation of the current effort into » long tern

' ‘denied area type of operation of the highest priority.

I. ASSUMPTIONS:

‘A. The United States Government will give public

. apsurances that, provided no nuclerr or offensive weapers fre ;

present or re-introduced into Cuba, end provided Cubs does
not teke aetion to threaten the perce ond security of the -
’ Western Heaisphere, the United States does not infend te te

invade Cuba or aupport sn invasion of Cuba. a suns

at.

B, These assurances will preclude any meaningful CIA
action ‘on a phased basis to provoke a revolt inside Cube, Since
unless there are major changes in operationnl and internal con-
ditions in Cuba, such a revolt if provoked would be totally

destroyed by Cuban counteraction in. a.matter of hours or, ot

as a arrive matter will. ate , duveding Cuba on’ the pretext

‘of: a contrived provocation such es an attack on Guantanano.

: C, CIA. operations. involving a.high noise level and a

, distinct elexent of, ‘attributability, particularly paramilitary,

: guerrillg,. ‘and comzando type operations will be unacceptable

as a matter of. ‘policy.

.D. The Cestro-communist regime will remain in power for

ithe indefinite future with its security and control apparatus

relatively intact and with the capability not only of erushing

unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

' conditions in Cuba increasingly difficult. While it is

possible that recent and future developments including the
Soviet action in removing the offensive weapons from Cubh mry
serve to weaken and discredit, Castro, there is as yet no hard

indication that the:control of the Castro-~communist regime over

Cuba has been substantially weakened.

Be ‘The United States assurances ‘of. no invasion and no

support of: an invasion will, in effect, constitute giving to

Castro and his regime a certain degree of senctuary, This will

5 matter to the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign
Intelligence. You will note that this lengthy document /

: bresks down under numerous sub-beadings the intelligence
coverage which has been developed. by the Clandestine Service.
Set out below sro specifics cf operational sction it is
proposed to take to continue and, as possible, increase in-
telligence coversce of Cuba. i

1. Intelligence Exploitation of Refugees: As you
know, with the quarantine and the cessation of sir

travel the heavy’ flow of Cuban refugees has dwindled

alwost to nothing. In view of this and in connection
~6~


with the contingency plenning for supporting any porsible
m}litary action _ Cuba, the Opa-Locke Interrogation ed
Canter as such win dismantled, ‘although. the personnel

of the ‘Center have been retained intect. In order to
_Fre-establish. the flow of intelligence from refugees,
it 4 ‘Proposed . that Pan American Airweys and KLa be
: induced’ to reinatitute their: regular: flights from

Havana -to Miami. This should be done ss soon as :
possible after the settlement of. the current negotintions
and UN Gigcussions. - Coincident with this, _ the Opa~Locka
vefugee interrogation center will be re-established

with the game personnel, :

: 2. Resident Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be

made to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the

viability of and, where necessary, re-establish conmunica-

|; tions. with the 131 recruited agents now resident in Cube.
“To ah extent, the speed and ‘effectiveness of this effort
will of course depend upon the stringency of future

Cuban security snd control action, which it is impossible
as yet to accurately forecast.

3. Third Country Operations: The priority on re-
cruiting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cuba
will be. reiterated snd strengthened and every effort
Will. be made to increase this coverage, both: through

the. a ‘evelopment of additional resident agents in Cubs



a i: :

e 9

and through the development of additionnl legal travellers.

4 :
4. Operations: We will continue to press

the who are sssisting us in the effort

agninst Cuba for additional coverage, including the

recruiting of egents within their own erens for joint

dispstch to Cuba. The Imost effectively co~

operating at this poiat in this connection ere the

Direct

approaches to several of these either by you

personally or in your name, ps you prefer, ere
being separately recomaended, Personal ropresentation

by you to the hnderlined ebove would be useful.

In addition, we will re-survey 11 other

with which we sre in contact and reiterate to those
appearing to have any assets usable sgainst Cuba our

extreme interest in maximum coverage of this problem.

In connection with the pproblem generally, we wilt

endesvor to induce ell of the to make

greater use of their assets, both inside and

outside cf Cuba. Perticular attention will be given to

possible utilizetion of the!
i. 5. Maritime Operations: In addition to increasing

efforts to get at serman agents end other aaritime

ossets through we will continue our

unilateral third country efforts to recruit seamen anc

a


prrticularly Cubon seamen, to increane the twenty
officers and crew members sboard six Cuban vessels we sre
now running as controlled agents,

6. Penetration of Cuban Instellations Abropd: At
the present time we are running 12 Cuben diplomats
stationed outside Cube ps controlled agents znd have vinhble
operations aimed st an additional 20 Cuban diplomats.
We propose to continue and intensify the current progren
of attempting te recruit or defect every Cuben officin!
represeutstive ebroad to whom we can gein access end
concerning whom we have eny reason to believe 8

susceptibility to approach exists. These additions!

penetrations will be otteapted both through E

operations end where eppropriate in conjunction with

7. Audio Penetrations of Cuban Installations
Abroad: At the present time we have sudio and/or

telephone tap coverege of Cuban officiel installations

in|

No

mejor expansion of this coverage is presently
contemplated, but we will continue to survey edditionrt
targets of opportunity and wherever possible install

coverage in those cases where the additional intelli~

gence from this type of source over and above whet we

ere now receiving would sppeer to make such installrtion

worthwhile,



AS

\, Gommunicetions Intelligence: We will contimc

our present CIA Close Support coverage from the KOLA

station in at the same level end will continue

to press HSA for cdditiongsl coverage of Cuben comaunicr
tions. As the current situstion “nermelizes" it shewld
be possible for NSA to reinstitute end perhaps even
increase their seaborne intercept coverage of: Cuben
communicstions.

9. Communist Party Operations: A complete survey
has been made world-wide of all Communist Farty
penetration operations ond wherever any such penetration
can be directed sgainst Cuba either by dispatching the
sgent to Cuba or by pointing the agent agsinst Cubrn
targets, ‘this will be done, except in those cases whers
such action would result in unaeceptablgprejudice te
the operations in the srea where the agent is now base.
It is believed that the most lucrative field for the
redirection of such operations to the Cuban target will
be Latin America where there are 65 penetrations of
verious communist parties. Of this 65, the survey
we have conducted indicstes thet 23 have some direct
pertinent access to Cuban targets. All of these 22 wil!

be directed against these tergets unless in uny cose

:sthere sre pverriding reasons,to, the contrary, The

-wemaining cases in the total of 65 are bein individually

ee 10. Illegally Infiltrated Agents: The two

q _ silecomstul black infiltrated teams (COBRA and AMTORRID)
1 which have produced substantial intelligence will be
: continued, resupplied, end reinforced but pointed
“prinartly at continued intelligence collection and rt
the recruituent for intelligence collection purposes of
3 ‘other Cubans, who already are legally resident in Cuba
an the areas where the tenms are operating (Pinar del
: " . Rio ana Oriente). In addition, on the nost careful ly.
selected basis, where it appeara feasible, ‘additional
. agents. and teams will ‘be infiltrated black into Cuba
: in an effort to duplicate the performance of the COBRA
and AMTORRID teans and particularly to. recruit and, cs
possible, train additional agents legally resident in
Cape. ;
i eld 11. Exfiltration: 4s feasible, egents end potentirt
recruits how in Cuba will be exfiltrated for
- training, indoctrination, supplying with communications,
and motivation. They will then be re-infiltrated into
Cube, primarily on intelligence missions. Where poasible,
this will be done through legal trave) channels, but
where this is not possible, it will be done wherever
. feasible through our ate infiltretion-exfiltration

: facilities, primarily our maritine assets.


B. Much of the above effort as noted will be primarily
dixrected towards developing all possible evidences of stress ~
or strain within the regime end between the regime and other

_ antions, particularly the Bloc, An intensive program will
be continued to teke advantage of any possible opportunity

bo: weaken, . subvert, ox split the xegine in any possible
fashion. This is basically: a lor “term effort. A great deal

” of work. already has gone into this and the current

status of this program and the proposed further expldtation

: of the numerous’ leads we have developed is being. made, in
the interests of brevity in this menorandum, the subject of
a separate compilation. The effectiveness of assets aimed rt
actually splitting the regine, i.e., 2 palece revolt, will of
course. depend, to an extent, on the willingness of the United

Ste
, that any: gueh effort might fail unless supported ‘with militery

Ty Government to support them and it is entirely possible

forces ‘which on Paid basis of the tearm Aches in Paragraph 1
above would appear “unlikely.

Sabotage: On the basia of the sssumptions set cut
above, commendo type sabotage, minor sabotage, and other
acts of sabotage inside Cuba would appear to serve little
purpose end should not be undertaken except in the rare
instances where an opportunity is presented with acceptable
rigk, to do major ‘demage to the Cuban econony. It, is proposed
to contitue. searching for such limited opportunities, but

no. active or wide scale program is contemplated.



oxy “as
2 D, Paramilita _Coumando and Guerrille rat Loris:
Given the assumptions in Paragraph I above, no wide scale
program of such activity should be undertaien, However, we
propose to maintain in being our present fecilities and
the capability of undertaking such operations in order to
“fully exploit any substantial change in internal Cuban con.
ditions or any substantial revolt or uprising which night oceur,
i gE. Economie Warfare: It is proposed to continue snd
intensify the program Blready undertaken to deny through ,
clandestine Sud covert means critics] materials to the Cuban

: _Sconomy, This consists primarily of deniel operations, possibly
: some reclusive buying and inducing frimdly U.S. and allied
firms and governnents to prevent the Shipments of strategic
materials to Cuba.
fommnee 7 Counterintelligence: The current counterintelligence
i ° and counterespionage program against the Cuban G-2 end

related services will be continued end as possible intensified.
This program has developed substantially and it should be

possible within the coming months to increase its effectiveness

considerably in countering not only Cuban but Bloc intelli.

* gence. operations mounted against United States interests
from Cuba.

G. Political Action, Propaganda, Psychologica) Warfare:

Sas: this fielw the following tasks hist be continued and where

: approprinte intensified:

4. Develop,’ maintain and exploit the will of the

: Cuban people to resist Castro-comunisn, making maximum

use of the downgrading of Castro nnd his regime during

8, Continue the infiltration of propaganda materin1

into Cuba via open mails, legal travellers and couriers,

‘with special emphasis on selective black operations.

HH, Exploitation of Exile Groups: We will continue

the clehdestine exploitation of exile groups for intelligence
collect inn, psychological warfare and other approved missicns,
As feesible, we will act to mount es mich cf this effort cs
possible from areas outside the continental United States, end
particularly from Latin America. If Higher Authority decides
“on a “Track Two" concept or on any, Similar concept which
contemplates heavy uncontrolled and only generally directed
section operations of Cuban groups egainst Cubr, it is believed
that efforts should be made to transfer as much a5 possible

* of the responsibility. for this non-clandestine, non-intel Ligence
“type. operation into the politics] field, which is the province
:of the Department of State, In this connection, it igs believed
jit would be rdvisable to press for tho crestion within the

- IV. ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROCEDURAL CHANGES:

Maximum duplementation of the above plan which provider
for the most intensive feasible collection of intelligence,
the implementationof related programs as outlined, and the
muintenance of capabilities to exploit targets of opportunity
ag well as take advantage of any future substantial changes
“in internal Cuban conditions will, 1t-1s believed, permit

and make advisable the following:
