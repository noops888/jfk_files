TP 92-1

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Extended investigative period of 4-29-65, due
’ to desire to include results of investigation conducted
by an auxiliary office, which information was not available
at time of previous report.

- On 11-15-65, MM 1027-C advised SA FRANCIS J.

DUFFIN that SID’ HANDWEILER had been talking to TRAFFICANTE
concerning a $300 debt that a friend of HANDWEILER owed

to TRAFFICANTE, and TRAFFICANTE wanted to know if HANDWEILER
was in on part of the deal. HANDWEILER denied to

TRAFFICANTE any involvement and TRAFFICANTE then allegedly
told HANDWEILER that TRAFFICANTE had an operation that was
taking over the Holiday Inn, Key West, Fla., and HANDWEILER
was broached as to his. interest in taking over the gambling
operation, numbers, horses, and sport bets which would be
operated out of the Holiday Inn Lounge. Allegedly, according
to TRAFFICANTE, a brother of the Sheriff of Monroe County~
was in for a piece of this deal. MM 1027-C further indicated
that HANDWEILER had asked the informant if the. informant
wanted to accompany HANDWEILER to Key West to help operate
such a venture.

During June, 1965, Sgt. JACK DE LA LLANA,
Intelligence Unit, Tampa, Fla., PD, furnished information
indicating possibility of a connection between TRAFFICANTE
and one ALPHONSO MARZANO, who has further been identified
as DON ALFONSO MARZANO, FBI # 488033. Information furnished
by DE LA LLANA indicated possibility that MARZANO,

TRAFFICANTE, and numerous other suspected La Cosa Nostra (LCN).
members planned some type of assembly in Italy during
summer of 1965.

. Investigation by the Miami Division has indicated
that MARZANO was contacted by Special Agents of the Miami
Office under the pretext of purchase of MARZANO's home on
7/2, 8, 29,/65, and no indication that either MARZANO or
TRAFFICANTE made any trip to Italy during summer 1965.

Information from records, Southern Bell Telephone
and Telegraph Co., Miami, Fla., was made available by MABEL
HIBBS and from’ General Telephone Company of Fla., Tampa,
Fla., by ALTON M. BRYANT.

TP 92-1

On December 7, 1965, TP T~14 advised that although
he is not personally acquainted with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, he
is personally acquainted with all of TRAFFICANTE's brothers,
who reside in Tanpa, Florida. He stated that in conversa-
tion from time to time with these brothers, he is certain
that SANTO controls gambling in an area extending from
Stone Mountain, Georgia to Miami, Florida. He stated
that TRAFFICANTE's brother, FRANK, had, on an occasion,
made a statement in the presence of TP T-14 indicating
that his brother, SANTO, did control such activities in
this area. TP T-14 stated he feels that TRAFFICANTE's
brother, SAM, actually controls the gambling operation
in Tampa in the absence of SANTO but that he is certain
that SAM and FRANK are active in such anoperation and
is of the opinion that TRAFFICANTE's brother, HENRY, has
a ‘small separate operation which, of course, would to
some extent, show a return to SANTO.

TP T-14 stated that he knows that SANTO's brother,
FRANK, is employed as a solicitor for a Tallow Company
but.that he is also certain that this is not the sole
means of income for TRAFFICANTE's brother. TP T-14
stated that he knows that on an occasion in the past,
SANTO's brother, FRANK, made a trip to Jacksonville,
Florida, to visit with a liquor store owner, who
operates Pony Liquors in Jacksonville, Florida. (JOHN
S. DE SALVO is the owner and operator of this establish-
ment and is known to be an associate of SANTO TRAFFICANTE)

On December’ 16, 1965, TP T-15 advised that he
had recently learned that HARLAN ALEXANDER BLACKBURN
of Orlando, Florida, was acquainted with two Miami,
Florida hoodlum gamblers named LOU KLINE and HYME MARTIN.
TP T-15 stated he understood that KLINE was considered
the right hand man in the numbers business of Miami
hoodlum, MYER LANSKY, and that apparently MARTIN and
KLINE were reluctant to understand why BLACKBURN was
apparently no longer ‘associated with the SANTO TRAFFICANTE
operation: : "

TP.T-15 advised that apparently MARTIN and
KLINE are part of an operation that might back BLACKBURN
financially in his numbers business in the future but that
such backing would have to have the approval of SANTO
TRAFFICANTE, indicating to TP T-15 that even though
not directly a TRAFFICANTE operation, that TRAFFICANTE
