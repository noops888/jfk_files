Review of Selected Items in the

Lee Harvey OSWALD File Regarding Allega-

tions of CASTRO Cuban Involvement in the

John F. KENNEDY Assassination

Letter by David W. Belin to

Mr. E. Henry Knoche, 15 April 1975,

paragraph 3 (Regarding Public Statement•

by CASTRO, etc.), attached

BACKGROUND

I. On Saturday evening, I September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,.

Daniel HARKER-

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which haä not been

expacted, and his agreement to the interview, that chis

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinarily provocative fashion

("

... KENNEDY is a cretin;" " ... the BATISTA of his

times

the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...

4.

The interview also contained an uncomplinentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by Unit

A States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's: "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWAlD resided

until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER, StOrY

appeared in the principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba."

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its reai

significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated te

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's renacks.

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper (9 September 1963, page B-4) and reworded the content

of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

litical aspects - in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements

and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY

assassination that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headquarters attention to the AP story very shortly after

the dallas killing.

More important, the interview appears

to have been fargotten in the contemporary political consid

eration. of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO.

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination

request, is to reconsider lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

by these governments of all elements of

OSWALD's handling and stay in the Soviet Union

and his contacts in Mexico City. The

Warren Commission report should have left a

wider "window" for this contingency. That,

indeed, was the opinion at the working level,

particularly in the counterintelligence com

ponent in the CIA in 1964. As was indicated

by Mr. Helms in his testimony before the

Warren Commission, CIA would continue to

regard this aspect of the OSWALD case as

still open.

In the absence. of additional or new

elements of "credible" evidence, there are

"nuances" in the record that emerge as note

worthy, in the light of other conclusions.

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually

there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else

or after his return to the United States.. The tecord reflects

no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-

INTERCEPTED CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE,

LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18: At 1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if

she had heard the latest

newS.

"Luisa" jokingly ieplied:

"Yes, of course, I knew

•it-almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three (she laughs], what barbarians! ..."

20:: Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination:

"Luisa" also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nar would

they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she

said she planned to move that night into the house of a

doctor (a woman) Friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion

of foreknowledge? This is the only item in the intercept

coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation..

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

"Luisa" was probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Directorate General of Intelligence (DGI) •

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headguarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, Formally

as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963) •

The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964; MIRABEL'S successor)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA-Perez.

c. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

• visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit:

Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the

applications to be handled solely by a local employee and

a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time.

And there remains the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

face,

could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited?. This

seems unlikely especially because VEGA is later cited by

use of the polygraph, on which ALVARADO showed evidences of

deception, and by bringing ALVARADO's former Nicaraguan

28.

The ALVARADO story is a particularly acute repte

sentation of the difficulties that beset the evaluation of

observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO:

whose account did not become public until the release of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro

socially promipent Mexican writer, married, but separated

She

Silvia DURAN, cited above.

There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communism.

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream. of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO*s

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in

a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964:

"Elena GARRO [said] that she and her

daughter were invited to a party at the Cuban

Embassy during the period she now finds out

that OSWALD was here in Mexico prior to the

assassination.

She was invited by a Mexican

secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

cousin of the GARRO family. (Horacio dUrANI.

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing around together like three bumps on a

through." She claims that on the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good loo's

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos 'without a doubt" at the

party-"

Manuel CARVILLO fOr CALVILLO], then an official in the

Secretariat.of the Gobernacion and were told he had orders

to escort them to a small and obscure hotel in the center

of town.

They were kept there for eight days under pretext

that they were in danger. When she told CARVILLO she wanted

to go to the American Embassy and explain what she knew of

OSWALD, she was told that the American Embassy was full of

Communist spies.

in certain particulars significantly modified her earliec

account. She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been interviewed by Embassy officers to whom she claimed

they did not give a very complete story because the

Embassy officers did not appear to give much credence to

anything they said.

34.. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been

interviewed by the Legal Attache on 17 and 24 November 1964-

Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her

account to THOMAS but had not been substantiated by inquiries.

The FBI lepresentative therefore considered the matter closed

his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation;

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the

events

she described as having occurred in the Mexican capital

in September 1963 never coincided with the confirmed data

Of OSWALD's presence there. Her story, however, had two

points congruant with allegations by others regarding

OSWALD:

a. ALVARADO's allegations regarding the

Negro with the red-dyed hair [this detail could.

however, have been gleaned from the

Warren Commission's published account of the

• "D" casel and

•b. Silvia DURAN's later claim of

- intimate personal contacts with OSWALD.

37. Beginning in March and amplified in May 1967, the

American Consul, Benjamin J. RUYLE, in Tampico developed a

contact with a local Mexican journalist,

Oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered

OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the

University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38.

In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA

officer:

He studied law at the University of Mexico

for three years, approximately 1960 - 1964.

He

belonged to a clandestine pro-CASTRO revolutionary

group at the University Regarding the OSWALD

case he was extremely cautious and although he

was not able or willing to give dates and

names, he said OSWALD visited the University

Of Mexico campus shortly after the Cuban

Embassy refused him a visa to visit Cuba.

OSWALD made inquiries regarding pro-Cuban

revolutionary groups at the University and

was directed to CONTRERAS and his friend.

OSWALD met CONTRERAS and four other persons

as they came out of a round-table discussion

held in the faculty of Philosophy. OSWALD

told the group it was urgent that he visit

Cuba and the Cuban Embassy had denied him a

visa.

He requested aid from coNtrEras' group.

CONTRERAS and others mistrusted OSWALD because

they felt he was a CIA provocation. The group

allowed OSWALD to accompany them the rest of the

day, that night and part of the next day. OSWALD

was very introverted and appeared to be slightly

crazy-

OSWALD made no mention of

an assassination

plot but kept bringing up the point he had

1. to

travel to Cuba immediately.

39 .

At this point, with FBI knowledge, the matter was

turned over to the Mexican authorities who determined that

CONTRERAS was indeed at the University of Mexico but only

for the years 1959 - 1960 and that he had been publicly

associated in protest activity for the Student Revolutionary

Bloc (BER) in January 1961. However, the groug ceased

functioning as such in the middle of 1962, and

Oscar CONTRERAS was never one of its leaders. No further

work is ieflected in the files on the CONTRERAS allegations.

'Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about

his own presence at the University, there is an additional

element that undermines the credibility of his account:

OSWALD's Spanish, which was barely adequate to get him meals

near the hotel, seems hardly likely to have permitted him to

carry on for an extended period with a University student

group-
