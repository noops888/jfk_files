BACKGROUND

ae on Satytday evening, ¥ September 1963, ale ea
“Fidel CASTRO appeared ata brazilian Embassy reception in:
Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an “Enformal
interview by the Associated Press correspondent,
Daniel HARKER. ; 7 i i = t Bie 7

2. HARKER's interview reached New ‘York on Sunday,
8 September, and was in print throughout the country on
“Monday, 9 September. There can be no question’ from iil
‘facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been
expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this
event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to geta

message on the record in the United States. ares ee

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range aE
topics but dealt principally with American political -
leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-
coriated in extraordinarily provocative fashion
(" ... KENNEDY is a cretin;" " ... the BATISTA of his
times’ areca: the most opportunistic American President of
all time ..."). cea

"4. The interview also contained an uncompLinentary
: reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

‘the Limitea nuclear test ban. There were differences in

“ehe, replay by. ont tates newspapers like a

H aN.
‘New York times. and Washington papers, with, a result that
CASTRO'S - "message" was significantly modulated.

significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated xe=

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO’s remarks.” cee é

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed the HARKER
‘story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the
paper (9 September 1963, page B-4) and reworded the content

ef the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

litical aspects - in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER
elements. and burying CASTRO'S warning to the United States
leadership in the middle of the piece. :

7. ‘There is no evidence in the files a the KENNEDY

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported
to be working in DGI Headquarters. i

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the
“events she described as having occurred in the Mexican capital
in September 1963 never coincided with the confirmed data
of OSWALD's presence there. Her story, however, had two
points congruant with allegations by others cegarding
OSWALD:

a. ALVARADO's allegations regarding the

Negro with the red~dyed hair [this detail could,

however, have been gleaned from the i :

Warren Commission's published account of the

case he was extremely cautious and although he
“was not able or willing to give dates and | aan

of Mexico campus ‘shortly after the Cuban
Embassy refused him a visa to visit Cuba.
OSWALD made inquiries regarding pro-Cuban
“revolutionary groups at the University and
was directed to CONTRERAS and his Eriend.

Oscax CONTRERAS was never one of its leaders. No further

‘Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about
