ENCLOSURES (2)

TO BUREAU

Two copies of a letterhead memorandum setting forth the

characterization of the informants utilized in instant report.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

On 12/27/62, Mrs. JOSEPH GRAMMARINO, 347 4th St., Brooklyn,

NÝ, wife Of JOSEPH GRAMMARINO, advised her husband leaves for work

each day at approximately 8:00 AM.. However, she disclaimea any

knowledge relative to his place of employment.

She further refuse

to furnish any information regarding his availability for an inter-

view, but stated that she would advise him to contact the NYo.

It may be noted that on 3/30/62, NY 3597-C* advised that

the subject had in his possession the name

"Little Joe, ST 8-8102"

Telephone no. ST 8-8102 is listed to the aforementioned individual.

On 12/28/62, Mr. HOWARD KREITSEK, Syosset - Woodbury

Road, Woodbury, LI, NY, was interviewed at the NYO. At the outset

of the interview, Mr. KREITSEK requested that he be allowed to

chronologically furnish the details of his association with the

subject without interruption.

Thereafter, he stated that he would

repeat the details so that notes could be

taken relative to the

matter.

Mr. KREITSEK spoke for a period in excess of two hours,

during which time he advised that he was forced to pay approximately

$28,000.00 to GRANELLO and GEORGE LEVINE under the threat of bodily

harm to

himself or his family.

KREITSEK stated that he still lived in extreme fear of the

subject and LEVINE.

Therefore, he would not testify against the

subject in a court

of law.

However, he stated that he would be

willing to cooperate in any other possible manner.

In this regard,

he suggested that he may be able to develop some

information

concerning GRANELLO through his, KREITSEK'S,

close friendship with

ROCKY GRAZIANO. KREITSEK described GRAZIANO as a close associate

of the subject, who is probably cognizant of most of the subject's

activities.

ADMINISTRATIVE Cont 'd

Due to the lateness of the hour at the conclusion of

KREITSEK's recitation, arrangements were made to recontact him

in the immediate future to record the details of his association

with the subject.

KREITSEK requested this recontact since he had

another appointment immediately following the interview.

In the

meantime, KREITSEK stated that he would endeavor to develop, through

GRAZIANO, some information concerning the subject's current activities

On several occasions during January, 1963, Mr. KREITSEK

telephonically contacted the NYO, but stated that due to business

committments he was not available

for an interview.

However

advised that he had been in contact with ROCKY GRAZIANO, but was

unable to develop any pertinent information concerning the subject.

By communication dated January 31, 1963, the Los Angeles

Division furnished the following information:

JOY RAHE presently resides at 1737 Sunset Plaza Drive,

Los Angeles, California. This is a private residence in an

exclusive section high in the Hollywood hills.

She has not been

interviewed to date due to the fact that telephone checks are being

made at the present time in an attempt to ascertain her contacts.

It is anticipated that she will be interviewed in the near future.

The information developed at the NY Telephone Company

and set forth in instant report, was furnished by Mr. EDWARD L.

BRAUNE,

Security Supervisor, NY Telephone Company, 4 Albany St.,

NY 5, NY.
