Chief Counsel and Director

Select Committee on Assassinations
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Bear Bob:
Herewith ace comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains
under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,
which he has not moved to have modified. To expose his true
status as a former CIA employee could have repercussions in his
present situation that we must accept as significant. When he .;
was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary
to remove his cover, in the event he decided to go overt in this
matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains
classified. We therefore request that the example set in the
Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy
Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft. a

Following are detailed comments:

NOSENKO

Circled Page 4, lines 3 through 20. Suggest the following
rewrite: =F

There were two factors, however, that limited the value
of the information supplied to the Committee by these
ex-KGB officers: 1) neither had ‘been assigned to‘ the
same KGB Directorate as Nosenko, and 2) one of :them had
jnformation about the KGB that was outdated. :
