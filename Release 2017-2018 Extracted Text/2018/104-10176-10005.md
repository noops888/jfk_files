2. There fe lirtie question thet LIRING-3 ‘seized the opportunity, given
bim by tke oudden apperition of OROZCO on the scene to cover vis a vis bis
wife a few days of nisbehaving. Instead of proceedizg to Tapachule to receive
from the FAR new coatract fostructions in Mexico Gity (an evkward arrangement
to sey the least), LIRING-3 remained at the sefe horse he uses in the capital
to receive the viste (se indicated by LIVZAT) of Berto VICISSER his “regular®
mistress, Silvia DURAH (of Lea Earvey OSWALD fame) acd possibly = certein
Yolenda (vho eppears for the first time in thie operation snd whose phone
gumber ig not in the Station reversed Mexico City telephone directory}

Pinned down on the fact that he wan in Mexico. City daring the period of 19
to 21 July, LIRING-3 admitted that he wae but felt that he had to tell
another lic racher than sduit bis misbehavior, This lie vas that he did not
want to sppesr dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON and so
wade bio first meeting with OROZCO “nore intriguing” by inventing the trip
to Tepachula. Yo edd credence to the Tapachula story, LIRING*3 previously
asked his wife to izprese ROWIOM with her concern for his, telling ROVTOS
that be hed disappeared for three days without telling ker where he went.
This she did very convincingly with auch sobbing and crying, The LIROSIN
Up which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not
operate properly thet day (it's recorder broke down) but, as luck will have
1t LIROSIH live nooitored » conversation between LIKING-3 and his wife
uring vbich the latter r.ported that her tears seemed to have convinced
thine patae ne Adak BAUME hed come mrerey hinme eal with
LERERG-3 Seacerned the nention of the alise which ROVTOH uses with LIRIEG-3
and 4 to various persons with whom LIRIG"3 1e in tocch. LIFEAT coverage
hed indicated, for example, that LIRING-3 menticned BO/TOa in alias to
Sergio VALUEZ, This LIRING-3 denied. He produced om 4 Auguat 1967 a
written review of all the people of interest to ROWTOY vithshom he has
been ia contact indicating whether or not he sentioned k0.TON's alias to
them, This review is attached to, one of ROWTON's reports dated 9 August.

3. What happened between OROZCO, LIRING@3, Sergio VALDEZ and Raul
MORENO fc explained in detail in ROWTOH's reports forwerded with this
dispatch, A few additional points should probably be made here. First of
all, part of the first meeting between LIRING-3 and CRCZCO at LIRING_3‘s
sefehouse was live-sonitored by LIROSIN when the latter returned hone from
his regular bartending job ie the early houre of the sorning. LIROSIN
heard enough (his recorder vas once sore inoperative) to basically confira
LIRING?3's report of bie meeting with OROZCO to ROWEOH. Secondly, neither
VALDEZ nor MORENO vere present during the oight of 31 July - 1 August vheo
LIRING"3 told OROZCO that the latter was in fact a deserter from the FAR,
refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING-3 information
on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL- aod 2). The two mea
arrived at LIRJNG-3's apartment in the early morning hours vhen OROZCO
had adnitted everything and thus do not know what prompted him to tell the
truth, Thirdly, LIRING-3 heista that he told CROZCO nothing about bie
plastic flower business and it's contemplated use to ccver activities in
support of the Guateaslen rebels. According to bis, (G0ZCO already knew
this as well as other details of his dealings with the FAR. LIRING-3
presumes that OROZCO lesrned this from the higher-ups cf the FAR guerrilles
while in the hills, OROZCO aistekenly apparently thought. that LIRING-3 wes
in the actual arms procurenent business whereas bis discussions with the
YAR have been liaited up to now to the eventual transportation of FAR
acquired supplies from Northern Mexico to Guatemala (with the PAR ascuming
the responsibility of smggling ¢ plies over the Guatemslen border),
LIRING-3's plactiz flower business designed to cover support activities on
behalf of the FAR, is oct, as a aatter of fact operative yet. Thus OROZCO
was badly informed LIRING-3's activities, How ORCECO hoped to obtein ares

+ from LIRING-3, had the latter been able to deliver som: st the Gustemlen

border rea, in view of the fact (ao he 1
broke, is a matter of conjecture, A desperate men any do desperate things
and LIRING"3 could have found himself in serious trosble. Judging from the
FAR's shooting habite it is a good thing in any case thet OROZCO wes not:
armed during the argument at LIRING*3's epsrtment the right of'31 July to
1 August, particularly when VALDEZ started to threatea him, =

CONTINUATICN OF

4, This station believes that the LIRING-3 Operation has reached @

critical point as @ result of the OROZCO affair, Both the Cubans and the

FAR (via Ernesto CAPUAKO Del Yecchio) have beentotified by LIRING-3 of | .

onozco's conduct and statements (a copy of ORCZCG's «-ssage forvarded
; Attachment Tvo was given CAPUAHO). If the PAR is at sli interested in
és LIRING-3 be will sonehow hear from the Goatesalen guerrillas and negociatioas
: concerniag ares and equine “til be reanped. LIPING-? hoe act beard from

“GARCIA® sincs Juns end does not even know if the latter io in Mexico.
H It is the Station's opinion that he probably will hear nothing directly

fron the Cubsns. :

e 5. Headquarters will note, per ROWTOH's report dated 28 July, the

: relative ease with which LIRI5G-3 clains to be obtaining a false passport
and other identity papers. The Cubsc’s passports that LIRING-3 purchased
im Huevo Laredo, mentioned in the same report, were issued in 1953 and 1959
‘ and cay be of marginal value, They will nevertheless be forvarded to

e Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these
passports.

Subject's Station file has just been reviewed for purging,
and it was noted that his OA is Still active and no final dispatch
has been written closing this file, even though we are no longer
in contact with Subject. Since Gerald D. FAHLANGER was the last
Case Officer in contact with LITAMIL-7, it is requested that
Headquarters have FAHLANGER (now assigned Headquarters) prepare
@ memorandum describing his last relationship with LITAMIL~7 and
Yeauesting that hic M4 aranted an 7 Vohrnawe TOG (innw1e31a\

contact with LITAMIL-7. Contact was dropped with LITAMIL-7 by

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

° SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7 i}

1. According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER. Kom 1, wha
is a temaie, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy
for more than 30 years, She was originaily regruited by former
Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject
‘was never a very productive asset, she did provide information on
activities of the installation and individuals working therein. In
approximately 1969-79, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy,
ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss!
of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with
the personnel, including the ambassador, For this reason the Station
maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too

. was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly

upor retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty tothem. This
‘was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when
she was working in the embassy. |

2, Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx-
imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in
view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the
embassy, our relations with her would be terminaed. However, if
she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work
part or fulltime, we would, of course, consider contact again. This,
of course, never happened,

- 3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive
spot payments for the information she submitted. She also received
occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday. The

Summary: During the period of this report, LITAMIL-7

Unfortunately, LITAMIL-7 has reported only routine information,
wuch of which the Station already obtained through other moans.
Im many cases, however, her information served to support
information the Station suspected or needed to confira. The
following were factors that contributed te LITAMIL-7'e apathy
and reluctance to collect and report information of value.
First, there was the problem of her health. Although she

did have high blood pressure, most of her preoccupation over
this cosditisa was psychouomatic. it appeared that it provided
ber with a crutch to justify her inability to service Station
requirezents. Second, and this was probably the most signifi-
cant factor behind her reluctance to collaborate fully, she
was aware of the LIRING attitude towards retention of foreign
expleysss im that office. im january 1998, LIRING released
all local employees except LITAMIL-7, and as the zonths vent
by it became increasingly evident that it was only a matter

of time before she would be released also. Evidence of her

imainent tersination tas given by the fact that she was given
less duties as the nonths passed, until at the very end she
did little sore than put in her time. With the spectre of
unemployment looming over the horizon, LITAMIL-7 was reluctast
to take any risk that might have compromisea oer sicuactiou at
LIRING. At stake was a sizable termination payment which the
PSRUMENers were obligated to pay her according to local
exployment regulations, Obviously, she vould do nothing to
jeopardize tl.s paysent, which amounted to approximately
$6,000 (U.S.). A further deterrent to her collaboration with
the Station, even after her release by LIZING om 31 March,
was the LIRING arrangezent to make the termination payment in
three increments, the last to be made at the end of April 1968,
In view of this latest developzent in this operation, the
Station has terminated the weekly meetings between the Station
Case Officer and LITAMIL-7. i
1. Introduction: During the period covered by this
report, LITAMIL-7 was met and debriefed on a weekly basis.
Her information was very limited and usually dealt vith internal
activities of a routine nature in LIRING. As pointed out above,
Ber yuvervapurs isusmieu wer iaum aii vue tue mums suucaue
administrative duties. Consequently, she lost access to
virtually everything that may have becn of interest to the
Station. The Station asked her to bring cut the book of
addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over
the years, but she refused for fear that it would be missed
curing the afternoon when she vas not on cuty. The Station
then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book a
few pages each day. She agreed, but before she began thir
process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find it failed.
She then began to compile a new pook of addresses and teiepaoze
Bumbers, which she intended to bring out, but one of the LIZIZG
officers asked for it on the day sbe was fired. In the ead,
the sum total of LITAMIL-7 LIRING information during the first
three months of 1968 was the identification of several
photographs ci LIKING employees, the tenuiative ideutificaticas
of offices and rooms in LIRING (tentative because she had
mot been in the second floor area since 1961, thus much of
the identification was from memory), and finally, LITAMIL-7
confirmed telephone numbers assigned to specific LIRING
personnel and furnished telephone numbers of individuals and
companies servicing LIRING maintenance requirements (: :
cleaners, pharmacy, typewriter repairmen, etc.). LITAMIL-7
volunteered to provide additional information on LIRING to the
Station provided it was within her capability, and after she
received her final severance payment from LIRING. :

2. Finance: LITAMIL-7 received no salary baal no ternina-
“tion bonus from the Station.

3. Securit: Since all contact with LITAMiL-7 was
maintai: Through LITAMIL-3, LITAMIL-7 doee not; have a Station
telephone number, She does not know the true nantes of any of
the Station Case Officers who handled her. All meetings with
her were held in her home, thus no safehouses were used, and
ghe was never seen with Case Officers in public./ She had no
telephone, so no contacts were made with her by phone.’ Frow
the security point of view, the LITAMIL-7 operation enjoyed
@ long life, January 1961 through March 1968. Taking into
account her fear and apprehension, plus the fact} that she
maintained good relations with LITAMIL-3, this record is all
the more remarkable. From the intelligence point of view, it
is unfortunate that her production was so sininal.

RSS S80 vesenenoveainon, : aeetniely | Ge lecwinees L_| 2ef3



: XY Gy :

Station intends to maintain a casual contact with her. It
is very likely that she may know new personnel assigned to
LERING and may be able to furnish information on these 1
individuals. There may also be developments in LIRING which,
on the basis of her lengthy service in LIKING, she might be
able to assess and clarify. Since LITAMIL-7 was not a
salaried agent for the Station, the operation cost nothing
more than the investment of Case Officer time, and an
occasional gift of flowers. In view of her istense pride,
there igs little reason to believe that she will accept money
in the future. If she is able to provide information to the
Statiom it will probably be doae without any thought of
compensation.
