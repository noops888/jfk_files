unde hio first meeting with OROZCO "sore intriguing" by inventing the trip

Io add credence to the Tapachule atory, LIRING 3 previously

Subject's Station file has just been reviewed for purging,

Since Gerald D. FAHLANGER was the last

it is requested that

a memorandum describing his last relatiorship with LI CAMILY and

be cancelled and file be closed.

Contact was dropped with LITAIL-T by i

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

° SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7

1. According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER.

LITAM,"" whr

is a jemale, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy

for more than 30 years.

She was originaily recruited by former

Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject

was never a very productive asset,

she did provide information on

activities of the installation and individuals working therein.

approximately 1969-79, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy,

ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss'

oi access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with

the personnel, including the ambassador, For this reason. the Station

was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly

upor retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them.

was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when

she was working in the embassy.

2. Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx-

imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in

view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the

embassy, our relations with her would be termina ed. However, if

she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work

part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This,

of course, never happened.

3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive

spot payments for the information she submitted. She also received

occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday.

During the perlod of this report, LITAMIL?

Most of the metings with LITAMILY

Into reporting information on the dally LIRING activities.

Unfortunately, LITAMILY has reported only routine laformation,

mch of which the Station already obtained through other roans.

In many cases, hovever, her information served to surport

infornation the Station suspected or needed to confir. The

follouing vere factors that contributed to LITAHlLY'a apathy

and reluctance to collect and report inforantion of value.

Furst, there was the problen of her bealth. Although she

did have high blood prossure, nost of her preoccupation over

this condition vas paycioninatic.

It apperred that it provided

ber with a crutch to justify her inability to service Station

roqutresents.

CONTINUATION OF

';*

S BCRET

THIA - 34598

Imminent tersination vas given by the fact that she was givea

less

duties as the nonths passed, until at the very end she

did little more than put in her time.

with the spectre of

unemployment looming over the horizon, LITAMILY was reluctant

to take any risk that might have compronisad nor sicuaiion at

LIBING.

At stake vas a sizable teruination payment which the

PaRUskers vere obligated to pay her according to local

enploysent regulations.

Obviously, she would do nothing to

Jeopardize tL. & paysent, which anounted to approxinately

$6,000 (U.S.).

A furtber deterrent to her collaboration with

the station,

even after her release by LIBING on 31 March,

was the LIBING arrangenent to make the termination paynent in

three incresents,

the last to be made at the end of April 1968.

In view of this latest development in this operation, the

Station has terminated the weekly meetings between the statlon

Case Officer and LITAMIL?.

I.

Introduction:

report,

During the period covered by this

LITANIL-T was wet and debriefed on a weekly basis.

Her information was very linited and usually dealt with internal

activities of a routine nature In LIBING. As pointed out above,

administrative duties.

Consequently, she lost access to

virtually everything that may have bech of interest to the

Station.

The Station asked her to bring out the book of

addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over

the yoars, but she refused for fear that it would be missed

caring the afternoon when she was not on auty.

The Station

then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book a

few pages each day.

She agreed, but before she began thir

process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find it failed.

she tea began to compile a new book of assresses and telephone

mumbers, which she intended to bring out, bat one

of the LIBIlG

officors asked for it on the day she was iired.

•In the end,

the sun total of LITAMILY LIRING information during the first

three months of 1908 was the identitication o1 several

photograpns of LIkING employees, the tentative identification

of offices and rooms In LIRING (tentative because she had

not been in the second floor area since 1961, thus much of

the identification was fron memory), and finally, LITAMIL?

confirmed telephone numbers assigned to specifie LIRING

personnel and furnished telephone nuabers of individuals and

compantes servicing LIBING maintenance requirements (dry

cleaners, pharmacy.

typewriter repairmen,. ete.). LITAMILY

volunteered to provide additional inforuation on LIRING to the

Station provided it was within her capability.

and after sbe

received her final severance payment fron LInInG.

livance:

LITANILY received no salary and no term

tlon bonus from the Station.

3.

Security:

Since all contact with LITAMIL? "As

nintained through LITAMIL-3, LITANILY does not| have a Statlon

telephone mumber.

She does not know the true nues of any of

the Station Case Officers who handled her.

All meetings with

her were hold in her home, thus no safehouses were used, and

she was never seen with Case Officers in publie.

She had no

telephone, so no contacts were made with ter by phone.

From

the socurity point of view, the LITAMIL T operation enjoyed

• long life, January 1961 through March 1968.

Taking into

mccount her fear and apprehension, plue the fact that sbe

maintained good relations with LITAMIL 3, this record is all

the more remarkable.

From the intelligence point of view, 18

Is unfortunate that her production mas so aislaal.

1. Future of the Oneration: Although for all intents

and purposes the LITAKILY operation has come to an end, the

Station intends to nalatain a casual contact with her.

I*

Is very likely that she my know ner personnel assigned to

I RING and nay be ab'o to furnish information on these

individuals.

There may also be developments in LIBING which,

on the basis of her lengty service in LIKING, she night de

able to assess and clarity.

Since LITAMIL vas not &

salaried agent for the Station, the operation cost nothing

more than the investaent of Case Officer tise,

and a

occasional gift of flowers.

In vier of her intense pride,

there is little reason

to belleve that she will accept money

in the future.

If she la able to provide information to the

Station It will probably be done without any thought of

compensation.
