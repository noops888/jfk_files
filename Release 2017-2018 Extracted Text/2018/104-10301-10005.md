Introduction

Office of the Director, the responsibilities of its personnel, and the
handling of communications in and with that Office. The term Office of
the Director includes the immediate offices of the DCI, the DDCI, the

and responses to the needs of the operating components of the Agency if
procedures detailed in this Notice are followed.

Individual Responsibilities

2. The responsibilities of the DCI and the DDCI were set forth by
the President in a letter to the Director, dated 16 January 1962, which
is quoted in part as follows:

"...it is my wish that you serve as the Government's principal
foreign intelligence officer, and as such that you undertake, as an
integral part of your responsibility, the coordination and effective
guidance of the total United States foreign intelligence effort. As the
Government's principal intelligence officer, you will assure the
proper coordination, correlation, and evaluation of intelligence from
all sources and its prompt dissemination to me and to other recipients
as appropriate. In fulfillment of these tasks I shall expect you to
work closely with the heads of all departments and agencies having
responsibilities in the foreign intelligence field,

"In coordinating and guiding the total intelligence effort, you will
serve as Chairman of the United States Intelligence Board, with a
view to assuring the efficient and effective operation of the Board and
its associated bodies, In this connection I note with approval that you
have designated your deputy to serve as a member of the Board,
thereby bringing to the Board's deliberations the relevant facts and
judgments of the Central Intelligence Agency.

“As directed by the President and the National Security
Council, you will establish with the advice and assistance of the
United States Intelligence Board the necessary policies and pro-
cedures to assure adequate coordination of foreign intelligence
activities at all levels.

“With the heads of the Departments and Agencies concerned
you will maintain a continuing review of the programe and activities
of all U.S, agencies engaged in foreign intelligence activities with a
view to assuring efficiency and effectiveness and to avoiding
undesirable duplication.

“As head of the Central Intelligence Agency, while you will
continue to have over-all responsibility for the Agency, I shall
expect you to delegate to your principal deputy, as you may deem
necessary, 80 much of the direction of the detailed operation of the
Agency as may be required to permit you to carry out your primary
task as Director of Central Intelligence. "

3. The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence directs the detailed
operations of the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as being the CIA
member of the USIB as indicated above. Statutory authorities of the
Director have been delegated by him to the Deputy Director. In the DCI's

the Agency and of the Office of the Director. He is charged with ensuring
necessary action by the proper component on decisions of the DCI and
DDCI, with responsibility for overseeing internal management, and for
ensuring coordination of component activities. It is the Executive Director's
responsibility to ensure that Agency components are kept advised of all
policy decisions or intra-governmental actions affecting them. All papers
requiring action on the part of either the Director or Deputy Director will’
be routed through the Executive Director. The Executive Director, as the
"Chief of Staff" of the Agency, acts for or in the absence of the DCI and
