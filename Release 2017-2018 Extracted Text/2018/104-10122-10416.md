SUBJECT: MASFERRER (ROJAS), Rolando Arcadio aka
MASFERRER, Rolend Robas

A covert national agency name check was conducted on Bubject
in January 1950 but his services have never been utilized by the
Agency. Subject, born about 1916 in Havana, Cuba, 1s a former
Cuban Senator and Cuban Commnist Party member from 1933 until 1945
when he was expélled from the Cuban CP. He is an enemy of CASTRO
end was described as 8 former "goon squad commander for BATISTA's private
army". He has been a political refugee since denuary 1959. His files
contain numerous FBI Teports regarding his activities as head of an
anti-CASTRO organization know as Milicias Anticommmistas Obreras y
Compesines (Mf0C) end his attempt to invade Cuba in 1960. This matter
was investigated by the FBI as en Internal Security = Cuba; Neutrality
case. : :

Latest information in his file is dated February 1967and concerns
consideration by the Internal Beourity Division, Department of Justice,
to prosecute Subject and certain of his followers as co-conspirators.
He and 75 of his followers had been @reested at Cocoa Plum Beach near
Marathon, Florida while preparing to leave for an invasion of Haiti.
Outcomes of the case is not reflected in his file.

Subject had asserted that his Plotting had been approved by the
U. S. Government. On some occasions Subject claimed @pproval by CIA
and at other times intimated @pproval came from the FBI. Unfavorable
publicity and compromise of Agency and sources and personnel were matters
being considered if the criminal charges against Subject were pressed
in court and the Agency was forced to document its denial of involvement.
