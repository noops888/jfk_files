Miami, Dec, 25, 1963

Dear IRMA,

I hope that you and your family are well when
this letter reaches you.

A few days. ago, I received your letters in Kew
Jersey, but since I left for Miami with my friends on
Saturday, in order to stay there two weoks and to take care
of some business, I did not write until I got here,

I want to tell you that there was some difficulty
with the vitamines, because the company which was supposed te
send them could not do so and I had to find another ageacy
to. do it because nobody wants that merchandise, duc to the
confiscation of the packages, but I was able to find ono
and I sent them to you, and I hope that you will notify me
as soon as you get them, because this is a new agency
for me,

I am glad that I am ablo to do that favor becnute
I think as much of that boy as I do myself,

Tell ny uncle FRANCISCO that his nephew from lexic
going to write to him and is going to send the IRMA letter t:
your address. :

I will tell you about KENNEDY's death in the othe
letter when I am in New Jersey. All that is a ?.

Steps are boing taken for your uncle to be able t-
get out of Mexico and I think that it will be possiblo to get
the visa soon, and to have him here.

I am not saying anything to you about Miami.
because I do not want to draw any conclusions yot."

Weil, IRMA, write to me at my address in Koy Jerse
as usual, Regards to the whole family.

Your brother in Christ,
(Signed with initials that look like J.u.)
