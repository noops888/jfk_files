Re: The Certral Intelligence Agency's Compliance with the JFK Assassination

Records Collection Act 44 U.S.C. § 2107

Dear Mr. Deutch:

Since 1994, the Assassination Records Review Board ("Review Board") has been

working with a number of Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency,

to locate and publicly release records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.

These actiors have been taken pursuant to The President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) ("JEK

Act"). We have been working with Mr. John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group

and Mr. Barry Harrelson, Senior Review Officer, Historical Review Group of CIA and

have appreciated the cooperation we have received.

The purpose of this letter is to request your agency's cooperation in assisting the

Review Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American

people that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplished to the greatest reasonable

extent. We want to assure the American people that the United States Government has

identified, located, and released all records relating to the assassination of President

Kennedy. Indeed, one of the paramount purposes of the JFK Act is to certify to the

public that the United States Government is not withholding relevant materials related

to the assassination. See, e.g., Assassination Materials Disclosure Act, H. R. Rep. No. 102-

625, Part 1, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. (1992) (" The Federal Government's failure to release

official materials has contributed to numerous conspiracy theories and fueled charges of

government complicity in the assassination... a salutary purpose is served in opening

these files [relating to the JFK assassination ] to allay the suspicion of government

cover-up.").

The Review Board has recently considered how it, along with the relevant federal

agencies, can best demonstrate to the American public that a thorough, good faith, and

diligent effort has been made to locate and release all remaining assassination-related

records within the control of the United States Government (and that the Government is

not hiding any such materials from public disclosure). Pursuant to the Congressional

mandate under the JFK Act to "create an enforceable, independent, and accountable

process for the public disclosure of such records," 44 U.S.C. § 2107(2)(a) 3), thie Review

Board seeks to have the relevant federal agencies provide a complete and specific

accounting of their efforts to locate and release assassination-related records, including

a full explanation for any destruction of such records.

Accordingly, the Review Board requests that each relevant agency adhere to the formal

compliance program (hereinafter "JFK Act Compliance Program") outlined below and

devised by the Review Board pursuant to its powers under Section 7()(1)(A), (B), (C),

(D), and (F) of the JFK Act. We hereby request that you undertake the following

measures by the dates provided (these dates were set in view of the fact that the

Review Board's operations currently are scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997):

Designation of Agency Compliance Official (or officials) and statement of

intent to comply with the JFK Act. We request that by December 9, 1996,

your agency designate an Agency Compliance Official who ultimately will

be responsible for ensuring that the agency has complied with its

obligations under the JFK Act, including the identification, location, and

organization of assassination records and the transmission of those

records to the National Archives and Records Administration (National

Archives"). Although the Review Board assumes that Mr. John Pereira or

Mr. Barry Harrelson will serve in this position, we nevertheless await

your formal confirmation. If necessary, your agency may designate

additional persons with knowledge of the measures that have been

undertaken to locate assassination records.

We also request that by December 9, 1996, the agency convey its

agreement to adhere to the compliance procedures outlined in this letter.

To the extent that any compliance procedure described below appears to

be unreasonable or to present difficulties that we may not have

anticipated, please explain why and make alternate suggestions to us.

Initial Statement of Compliance. We request that the Agency Compliance

Official prepare, by January 6, 1997, an initial written statement of the

agency's compliance with the JFK Act ("Statement of Compliance"),

setting forth the steps that the agency has taken to locate and process

assassination records. The Review Board recognizes that many of the

relevant federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have

previously written letters to the Review Board apprising it of their

progress at various stages of identifying and processing assassination

records under the JFK Act. The Statement of Compliance, while it nay

include information previously reported to the Board, is to be the agency's

comprehensive and final report to the American public of what it has

done to locate records relating to the assassination. This Statement of

Compliance shall include, to the fullest reasonable extent, the following

information:

a.

A complete description of all steps that your agency took to

identify and locate assassination records including, but not limited

to, an identification of the major record collections and files that

were consulted in the agency's search, any departmental file

indices consulted, the names and titles of the persons who were

responsible for conducting the searches, the physical locations of

the records that were searched, the off-site storage facilities (e.g.

Federal Records Centers) searched, the specific steps that were

taken to locate and retrieve materials in archives, and any other

criteria used by the agency to locate assassination records.

A description of the steps that the agency took in direct response to

specific requests of the Review Board to locate certain additional

records or information relating to the assassination. In particular,

we ask that the CIA describe what specific steps it has taken to

address the following requests: CIA-9, Publications and Analytical

Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated March 6, 1996 to Mr.

John Pereira); CIA-11, Silvia Duran's Original Statement (See David

G: Marwell letter dated May 3, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); CIA-12,

JMWAVE Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated May 22,

1996 to Mr. John Pereira); for HTLINGUAL records (See T. Jeremy

Gunn Memorandum dated October 1, 1996 to Mr. Barry Harrelson);

and for Monthly Operational Reports on Cuban Exile Groups (See

Manuel E. Legaspi Memorandum dated October 17, 1996 to Mr.

Barry Harrelson).

c.

To the extent that any assassination-related records have been

destroyed by the agency or any agency official, a full and specific

explanation of the circumstances surrounding the destruction of

such records.

d.

The status of remaining work that you can now identify that needs

to be completed by your agency in order to comply fully with the

JFK Act, including an identification of the categories of records

that must be processed and transmitted to the National Archives, a

description of any additional searches for files that must be done,

and the projected date(s) for completion of these tasks.

Review Board Interview With Agency Compliance Official (or Officials).

Shortly after the submission of the agency's written Statement of

Compliance, we ask that the Agency Compliance Official (as well as any

persons who helped prepare the agency's initial Statement of

Compliance) be made available to the Review Board for an interview

regarding the location of agency assassination records. The interview will

be used as an opportunity to resolve any outstanding questions regarding

the agency's search, including any follow-up tasks to be completed by the

agency. The Review Board anticipates that these interviews will be

conducted in January 1997.

Submission of Final Agency Declaration of Compliance. By July 1, 1997,

Federal agencies are expected to complete the process of identification,

location, and declassification of its assassination records at which time

they should submit to the Review Board a final declaration certifying,

under oath, their compliance with the provisions of the JFK Act (the "Final

Declaration of Compliance"). Because of the volume of CIA records, such

a "final" statement may not be practicable at that time. However, we do

expect that CIA will provide a complete status appraisal by July 1, 1997.

This final declaration shall set forth all of the information initially set forth

in the initial Statement of Compliance and shall also supplement the initial

Statement of Compliance by detailing any further steps that were

conducted by the agency in identifying and locating assassination records.

The agencies' Final Declarations of Compliance will be included in our

final report to Congress.

Compliance Depositions. Starting on or about August 1, 1997, the Review

Board, pursuant to its statutory authority, may conduct depositions,

under oath, of the Agency Compliance Official along with any other

agency officials with responsibility for complying with the JFK Act. The

decision to take a compliance deposition of an agency will be made on a

case by case basis, taking into account the importance of the agency to the

work of the JFK Act and the sufficiency of the agency's efforts to account

fully for its compliance with the JFK Act. In the event that the Review

Board decides to commence a compliance deposition of an agency, the

responsible agency designee(s) will be expected to testify under oath with

respect to any and all issues relating to the agency's record search,

including the scope of the search, the identity of files searched, the

destruction of any relevant records, and any other matters set forth in the

Final Declaration of Compliance. Any person obligated to appear for a

deposition under oath shall be fully entitled to obtain legal representation.

questions or suggestions regarding the Compliance Program, please do not hesitate to

Thank you for your cooperation with our work.

ssination for the period 20-30 November 1963.

- Minsk radio factories (where Oswald was employed)

and possible Cuban training bases in the Minsk region for

the period October 1959 to January 1963.

- Helsinki and visas to try to capture information

on Oswald's visa application. The Board also asked for

information on hotels in Moscow and Minsk where Oswald may

have stayed.

December 10, 1997

Barry,

Welcome back! Here are the two letters we received from the LBJ Library with

the listed materials attached. We can process these documents as assassination records

by designating only the sections of the reports/ checklist/memoranda that are

assassination related and declaring the rest NBR. We could include a short

memorandum which explains that these documents are compilations of lots of issues,

and the NBR redactions are unrelated to the assassination. If these materials are about

to be released under the Executive Order and there are no redactions in the

assassination related parts, the Board will probably not need to see them.

As long as you are talking to the Executive Order folks, there were additional

materials (beyond the ones specified in these letters) which the LB] Library sent to CIA

and I reviewed early last spring. Some of those items also could be designated as

assassination records. I can give you a copy of the list if you don't have it. It would be

nice to know what has happened to these materials too.

Thanks for checking on this issue SIt S part of CLA 9 If this issue is settled,

CLA-9 may be close to completion.

COMMENTS

The following is a list of some of the LBJ Library documents that have not reached us in the

review process. As I understand it, these were submitted to you by the library and marked as

assassination records by Michelle. They are related to request CIA-9. As we discussed these are

not the balance of the LBJ library records awaiting review, only the most easily identified.

REFERENCE:

Barbara,

Could you take a few minutes before the ARP to look at how we are handling the Checklists.

ARRB has requested 11 (Nov. 20-30); Jim Hanrahan is reviewing.

Have you finished your review of the 24 documents sent previously? If so could you bring them

with you.

The two items you gave me to review last week are not considered "assassination records"; you

can close the book on them.

The ARRB staff will not complete its review. of DI documents until the end of this week. Hopefully

they will not select many as assassination reeords (AR). If possible, I would like to set up coordination

session at IP. I will call you as soon as I know how many assassination records we have.

Thanks for you help.

Analyst

Subject:

CIA-9 Publications and Analytical Materials

The Review Board's Request for Additional Records and Information CIA-9 asked the

CIA to locate CIA or Intelligence Community serial publications for the dates

immediately before and after the assassination (November 20-30, 1963), including such

publications as the President's Daily Brief, the President's Checklist, and any serial

publications related specifically to Cuba or the Soviet Union. Review Board also

requested that a search be undertaken for any analytical materials bearing upon the

assassination.

In response to the Review Board's request, the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) searched

for serial publications which might contain information of relevance to the

assassination, special or ad hoc reports pertaining to the assassination, and raw

intelligence reports on topics which might pertain to the assassination. All the material

s supplied by the Directorate of Intelligence have been reviewed by the Review Board

staff. Material within these publications, relevant to the assassination of President John

Kennedy, was designated as assassination records. Due to the sensitive and worldwide

nature of the information contained in most of these Directorate of Intelligence

publications, only material relevant to the assassination was designated as an

assassination record. These designated records will be processed and sent to the JFK

Collection at the National Archives.

The Directorate of Intelligence supplied copies of the following serial publications for

the period November 20-30, 1963 or containing information which from the period

November 20-30, 1963.

The President's Intelligence Checklist, the predecessor of The President's Daily Brief,

an all-source daily summary of intelligence information designed for the

President and a small number of high level officials.

The Daily Brief of the Central Intelligence Bulletin, a larger and more detailed all-

source publication with a wider distribution.

The Weekly Review - Office of Current Intelligence, an all-source weekly

compendium of events available on Fridays.

The Weekly Summary - Office of Current Intelligence, a more limited version of The

Weekly Review mentioned above. The Weekly Summary only contained material up

to the SECRET level.

According to the Directorate of Intelligence, only one analytical report on Cuba or the

Soviet Union, dated November 15, 1963, was issued near the relevant period. The

Review Board staff read this report but did not designate it as an assassination record.

The Review Board staff also examined The President's Intelligence Briefing Book, dated

November 26, 1963, a compendium of information on major intelligence issues affecting

the national security of the United States, which was prepared for President Lyndon

Johnson. This briefing book was not designated as an assassination record.

In addition, the Di was asked to search for intelligence reporting on anti-Castro activity

by Cuban exile groups in the United States from January 1961 - January 1964. The

Weekly Review - Office of Current Intelligence for April 5, April 12, and April 19, 1963 were

found to contain relevant information on exile raids on Cuban targets. The relevant

portions of these documents were designated as assassination records.

Finally, the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) searched for records based on subjects

supplied by the Review Board staff. The DI database is searchable only by general

subject headings assigned from a master list and coded to particular documents. This

database is not searchable by keyword. In response to the Review Board's request, the

Di supplied raw intelligence reports (not finished analytical intelligence documents) for

the period November 20 - November 30, 1963 for the USSR, Cuba, and Mexico.

Documents relevant to the assassination of President John Kennedy were designated as

assassination records.

The DI reported that there were no DI intelligence reports on the following subjects

searched at the request of the Review Board staff:

Dear Ms. Denk:

This is in response to referent request.

Searches were made for information responsive to the

request and materials were

provided for examination by ARRB

From that examination, staff members selected a

number of documents to be included within the JEK

Collection.

Those documents have now been included

with the

JFK Collection and are being processed for released to NARA.

This concludes the Agency's action on this request. If

you have any question, please advise.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

OFFICE:

SUBJECT:

J. Barry Harrelson@DCI

DI/IRO

DI/IRO

Disposition of the DI/IRO on the release of Country Names in the 11

PICLs Reviewed by

Me for the ARRB

REFERENCE:

1. In light of the additional details, laying out the background of negotiations on the PICLs conducted by

in OGC and articulated in a note to George last week--not sent to me, I concur with the

inclusion of country names of even the non-relevant titles in the text of the reviewed P/CLs. It's always

easier to make appropriate decisions when one is armed with the full knowledge of the background. In

light of my very short tenure in dealing with this issue, I would appreciate in the future receiving any

background or additional information on prior negotiations that has bearing on decisions I must make.

Additionally, having that background information ahead of any review or disposition saves time and effort,

and result in the best decision not only for the Di but also for the Agency.

2. This concludes the Di action on this matter. A signed copy of this memorandum will be sent to Barry

for his records.
