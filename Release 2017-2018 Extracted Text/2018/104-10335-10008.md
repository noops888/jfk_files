Re: Assassination Records Review Board Request for Additional Information and
Records No. CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

Dear John:

We would once again appreciate your assistance in obtaining access to CIA records of
possible pertinence to the John F. Kennedy assassination. We request that you locate
CIA or Intelligence Community serial publications for the dates immediately before and
after the assassination (November 20-30, 1963), including such publications as the
President’s Daily Brief, the President’s Checklist, or any serial publications related
specifically to Cuba or the Soviet Union. In addition to intelligence reports, we also
request that a search be undertaken for any analytical materials bearing upon the
assassination.

As with our previous requests, we would be pleased to discuss with you ways in which
we might better refine this request.

Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,

David G. Marwell

Re: The Central Intelligence Agency’s Compliance with the JFK Assassination
Records Collection Act, 44 ULS.C. § 2107 : :

Dear Mr. Deutch:

Since 1994, the Assassination Records Review Board (“Review Board”) has been

working with a number of Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency,”

to locate and publicly release records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.
These actioris have been taken pursuant to The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (“JFK

. Act”). We have been working with Mr. John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group

and Mr. Barry Harrelson, Senior Review Officer, Historical Review Group of CIA and
have appreciated the cooperation we have received.

The purpose of this letter is to request your agency’s cooperation in assisting the
Review Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American
people that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplished to the greatest reasonable
extent. We want to assure the American people that the United States Government has
identified, located, and released all records relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy. Indeed, one of the paramount purposes of the JFK Act is to certify to the
public that the United States Government is not withholding relevant materials related
to the assassination. See, e.g., Assassination Materials Disclosure Act, H. R. Rep. No. 102-
625, Part 1, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. (1992) (“The Federal Government's failure to release
official materials has contributed to numerous conspiracy theories and fueled charges of
government complicity in the assassination . . . a salutary purpose is served in opening
these files [relating to the JFK assassination ] to allay the suspicion of government
cover-up.”).

The Review Board has recently considered how it, along with the relevant federal
agencies, can best demonstrate to the American public that a thorough, good. faith, and
diligent effort has been made to locate and release all remaining assassination-related
records within the control of the United States Government (and that the Government is
not hiding any such materials from public disclosure). Pursuant to the Congressional
mandate under the JFK Act to “create an enforceable, independent, and accountable -
process for the public disclosure of such records,” 44 U.S.C. § 2107(2)(a)(3),.:tie Review
Board seeks to have the relevant federal agencies provide a complete and specific
accounting of their efforts to locate and release assassination-related records,including
a full explanation for any destruction of such records.

Accordingly, the Review Board requests that each relevant agency adhere to the formal
compliance program (hereinafter “JFK Act Compliance Program”) outlined below and
devised by the Review Board pursuant to its powers under Section 7(j)(1)(A), (B), (C),
(D), and (F) of the JFK Act. We hereby request that you undertake the following
measures by the dates provided (these dates were set in view of the fact that the
Review Board’s operations currently are scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997):

intent to comply with the JFK Act. We paaaer| that i December 9, 1996,
your agency designate an Agency Compliance Official who ultimately will
be responsible for ensuring that the agency has complied with its
obligations under the JFK Act, including the identification, location, and
organization of assassination records and the transmission of those
records to the National Archives and Records Administration (“National
Archives”). Although the Review Board assumes that Mr. John Pereira or
Mr. Barry Harrelson will serve in this position, we nevertheless await
your formal confirmation. If necessary, your agency may. designate
additional persons with knowledge of the measures that have been
undertaken to locate assassination records. :

We also request that by December 9, 1996, the agency convey its
agreement to adhere to the compliance procedures outlined in this letter.
To the extent that any compliance procedure described below appears to
be unreasonable or to present difficulties that we may not have
anticipated, please explain why and make alternate suggestions to us.

2. Initial Statement of Compliance. We request that the Agency Compliance
Official prepare, by January 6, 1997, an initial written statement of the


13-00000

The Honorable John M. Deutch
November 27, 1996
Page3

agency’s compliance with.the JFK Act (“Statement of Compliance”),
setting forth the steps that the agency has taken to locate and process
assassination records. The Review Board recognizes that many of the
. relevant federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have
previously written letters to the Review-Board apprising it of their
progress at various stages of ‘identifying and processing assassination
records under the JFK Act. The Statement of Compliance, while it may
include information previously reported to the Board, is to be the agency’s
comprehensive and final report to the American public of what it has
done to locate records relating to the assassination. This Statement of
Compliance shall include, to the fullest reasonable extent, the following
information:

a. A complete description of all steps that your agency took to
identify and locate assassination records including, but not limited
to, an identification of the major record collections and files that
were consulted in the agency's search, any departmental file
indices consulted, the names and titles of the persons who were
responsible for conducting the searches, the physical locations of —
the records that were searched, the off-site storage facilities (e.g.,
Federal Records Centers) searched, the specific steps that were
taken to locate and retrieve materials in archives, and any other
criteria used by the agency to locate assassination records.

b. Adescription of the steps that the agency took in direct response to
specific requests of the Review Board to locate certain additional
records or information relating to the assassination. In particular,
we ask that the CIA describe what specific steps it has taken to
address the following requests: CLA-9, Publications and Analytical
Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated March 6, 1996 to Mr.
John Pereira); CLA-11, Silvia Duran’s Original Statement (See David
G. Marwell letter dated May 3, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); CIA-12,
JMWAVE Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated May 22,
1996 to Mr. John Pereira); for HTLINGUAL records (See T. Jeremy
Gunn Memorandum dated October 1, 1996 to Mr. Barry Harrelson);
and for Monthly Operational Reports on Cuban Exile Groups (See
Manuel E. Legaspi Memorandum dated October 17, 1996 to Mr.
Barry Harrelson).

The Honorable John M. Deutch

c. To the extent that any assassination-related records have been

: destroyed by the agency or any agency official, a full and specific
explanation of the circumstances surrounding the destruction of
such records.

d. The status of remaining work that you can now identify that needs
to be completed by your agency in order to comply fully with the
JFK Act, including an identification of the categories of records
that must be processed and transmitted to the National Archives, a
description of any additional searches for files that must be done,
and the projected date(s) for completion of these tasks.

ae after the submission of ra agency’s ‘written nn Statement of
Compliance, we ask that the Agency Compliance Official (as well as any
persons who helped prepare the agency’s initial Statement of
Compliance) be made available to the Review Board for an interview
regarding the location of agency assassination records. The interview will
be used as an opportunity to resolve any outstanding questions regarding
the agency’s search, including any follow-up tasks to be completed by the
agency. The Review Board anticipates that these interviews will be
conducted in January 1997.

4, Submission of Final Agency Declaration of Compliance. By July 1, 1997,
Federal agencies are expected to‘complete the process of identification,
location, and declassification of its assassination records at which time
they should submit to the Review Board a final declaration certifying,
under oath, their compliance with the provisions of the JFK Act (the “Final
Declaration of Compliance”). Because of the volume of CIA records, such
a “final” statement may not be practicable at that time. However, we do
expect that CIA will provide a complete status appraisal by July 1, 1997.
This final declaration shall set forth all of the information initially set forth
in the initial Statement of Compliance and shall also supplement the initial
Statement of Compliance by detailing any further steps that were
conducted by the agency in identifying and locating assassination records.
The agencies’ Final Declarations of Compliance will be included in our
final report to Congress.

itions. Starting on or about August 1, 1997, the Review
Board, pursuant to its statutory authority, may conduct depositions,
under oath, of the Agency Compliance Official along with any other
agency officials with responsibility for complying with the JFK Act. The
decision to take a compliance deposition of an agency will be made ona
case by case basis, taking into account the importance of the agency to the
work of the JFK Act and the sufficiency of the agency’s efforts to account
fully for its compliance with the JFK Act. In thé event that the Review
Board decides to commence a compliance deposition of an agency, the
responsible agency designee(s) will be expected to testify under oath with
respect to any and all issues relating to the .agency’s record search,
including the scope of the search, the identity of files searched, the
destruction of any relevant records, and any other matters set forth in the
Final Declaration of Compliance. Any person obligated to appear for a
deposition under oath shall be fully entitled to obtain legal representation.

We look forward to receiving your initial response, by December 9, that designates your
Agency Compliance Official and includes your statement regarding your position with
respect to the provisions outlined in this letter. To the extent that you have any
questions or suggestions regarding the Compliance Program, please do not hesitate to
contact our General Counsel, T. Jeremy Gunn, at (202) 724-0088.

Thank you for your cooperation with our work.

Sincerely,

ExDir, dtd. 27 Nov 1996, (attached)

1. The attached request was received from the
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) in March 1996. It
appears from our records that a copy was not sent to you.
(Our normal procedure is to provide the appropriate
Directorate Focal Point a copy of the request as soon as
received.) This is one of several requests placed on hold
while we worked on other ARRB priorities.

2. In the Agency's response to the 27 November
“Compliance” letter (see reference), we asked the ARRB to
prioritize their requests. The ARRB staff has identified
CIA-9 as a “priority” request.

3. The initial request is for access not release. We
usually limit access to sensitive material to Jeremy Gunn,
ARRB General Counsel, and one or two of his staff. If the
material is particularly sensitive, access is restricted to
Mr. Gunn and/or the Executive Director of the Board, Mr.
David Marwell. Gunn, Marwell and all members of the ARRB
Staff's CIA team are fully cleared (TS/SCI).

4. HRG reviewer Jim Hanrahan (81809) is the focal point
for this request. Many of the documents described in CIA-9
were part of eight Executive Order Mandatory Review requests
{see attachments) from 1994 and 1995. Jim has obtained from
IP&CRD full-text copies of the documents. He will be in
touch with you concerning access to these specific
documents.

5. Mr. Gunn will be at IP the week of February 24 to
review documents. Please advise HRG as soon as possible of

MATION

December 10, 1997

Barry,

Welcome back! Here are the two letters we received from the LBJ Library with
the listed materials attached. We can process these documents as assassination records
by designating only the sections of the reports/checklist/memoranda that are
assassination related and declaring the rest NBR. We could include a short
memorandum which explains that these documents are compilations of lots of issues,
and the NBR redactions are unrelated to the assassination. If these materials are about
to be released under the Executive Order and there are no redactions in the
assassination related parts, the Board will probably not need to see them.

As long as you are talking to the Executive Order folks, there were additional
materials (beyond the ones specified in these letters) which the LBJ Library sent to CIA
and I reviewed early last spring. Some of those items also could be designated as
assassination records. I can give you a copy of the list if you don’t have it. It would be
nice to know what has happened to these materials too.

94 If this issue is settled,

Thanks for checking on this issueg{€ig
CIA-9 may be close to completion.

COMMENTS

The following is a list of some of the LBJ Library documents that have not reached us in the
review process. As I understand it, these were submitted to you by the library and marked as
assassination records by Michelle. They are related to request CIA-9. As we discussed these are
not the balance of the LBJ library records awaiting review, only the most easily identified.

CIA §
FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
JFK Project Officer £ -
OFFICE: OIM/HRP.
SUBJECT: ARRB Request CIA-9: President's Intelligence Checklists
REFERENCE:
Barbara,

Could you take a few minutes before the ARP to look at how we.are handling the Checklists.
ARRB has requested 11 (Nov. 20-30); Jim Hanrahan is reviewing.

Have you finished your review of the 24 documents sent previously? If so could you bring them
with you.

The two items you gave me to review last week are not considered “assassination records"; you
can close the book on them.

The ARRB staff will not complete its review of DI documents until the end of this week. Hopefully
they will not select many as assassination records (AR). If possible, | would like to set up coordination
session at IP. | will call you as soon as | know how many assassination records we have.

Thanks for you help.

Barry

MEMORANDUM

September 12, 1998

To: Laura Denk
Executive Director
cc: Bob Skwirot
CIA Team Leader

From: Michelle Combs Pehle Cb

Associate Director for Research and Review

Ben Rockwell &. Wall \

Analyst
Subject: CIA-9 Publications and Analytical Materials -

The Review Board’s Request for Additional Records and Information CIA-9 asked the
CIA to locate CIA or Intelligence Community serial publications for the dates
immediately before and after the assassination (November 20-30, 1963), including such
publications as the President’s Daily Brief, the President’s Checklist, and any serial
publications related specifically to Cuba or the Soviet Union. Review Board also
requested that a search be undertaken for any analytical materials bearing upon the
assassination.

In response to the Review Board’s request, the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) searched
for serial publications which might contain information of relevance to the
assassination, special or ad hoc reports pertaining to the assassination, and raw
intelligence reports on topics which might pertain to the assassination. All the material
s supplied by the Directorate of Intelligence have been reviewed by the Review Board
staff. Material within these publications, relevant to the assassination of President John
Kennedy, was designated as assassination records. Due to the sensitive and worldwide ~
nature of the information contained in most of these Directorate of Intelligence
publications, only material relevant to the assassination was designated as an
assassination record. These designated records will be processed and sent to the JFK
Collection at the National Archives.

The Directorate of Intelligence supplied copies of the following serial publications for
the period November 20-30, 1963 or containing information which from the period
November 20-30, 1963.


13-00000

The President's Intelligence Checklist, the predecessor of The President's Daily Brief,
an all-source daily summary of intelligence information designed for the
President and a small number of high level officials.

The Daily Brief of the Central Intelligence Bulletin, a larger and more detailed all-
source publication with a wider distribution.

The Weekly Review - Office of Current Intelligence, an all-source weekly
compendium of events available on Fridays.

The Weekly Summary - Office of Current Intelligence, a more limited version of The
Weekly Review mentioned above. The Weekly Summary only contained material up
to the SECRET level.

According to the Directorate of Intelligence, only one analytical report on Cuba or the
Soviet Union, dated November 15, 1963, was issued near the relevant period. The
Review Board staff read this report but did not designate it as an assassination record.

The Review Board staff also examined The President's Intelligence Briefing Book, dated
November 26, 1963, a compendium of information on major intelligence issues affecting
the national security of the United States, which was prepared for President Lyndon
Johnson. This briefing book was not designated as an assassination record.

In addition, the DI was asked to search for intelligence reporting on anti-Castro activity
by Cuban exile groups in the United States from January 1961 - January 1964. The
Weekly Review - Office of Current Intelligence for April 5, April 12, and April 19, 1963 were
found to contain relevant information on exile raids on Cuban targets. The relevant
portions of these documents were designated as assassination records.

Finally, the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) searched for records based on subjects
supplied by the Review Board staff. The DI database is searchable only by general
subject headings assigned from a master list and coded to particular documents. This
database is not searchable by keyword. In response to the Review Board’s request, the
DI supplied raw intelligence reports (not finished analytical intelligence documents) for
the period November 20 - November 30, 1963 for the USSR, Cuba, and Mexico.
Documents relevant to the assassination of President John Kennedy were designated as
assassination records.

The DI reported that there were no DI intelligence reports on the following subjects
searched at the request of the Review Board staff:


13-00000

USSR and assassination

Cuba and assassination
Mexico and assassination
Minsk radio factories

Cuban training bases in Minsk
Helsinki and visas

Me for the ARRB

REFERENCE:

in OGC and articulated in a note to George last week--not sent to me, | concur with the

inclusion of country names of even the non-relevant titles in the text of the reviewed PICLs. It's always

easier to make appropriate decisions when one is armed with the full knowledge of the background. In

light of my very short tenure in dealing with this issue, | would appreciate in the future receiving any pe
background or additional information on prior negotiations that havi Searing on decisions | must make.
Additionally, having that background information ahead of any review or disposition saves time and effort,

and result in the best decision not only for the DI but also for the Agency.
