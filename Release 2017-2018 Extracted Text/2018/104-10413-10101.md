On Monday, 8 May 1972, MT. Arthur Dooley visited

Congressman Richard Ichord

to show him

the exhibits he

requested

Mr. Ichord

the House Committee

Internal Security.

It was quickly apparent that he knew very little about

the Oswald case, and that he had been misled by Bernard

Fenstervald, Jr. regarding the extent of CIA's coverage

of Oswald when he was in Mexico City. Mr. Ichord ex-

amined the documents and raised a number of points

which were answered candidly and without reservation.

He thanked us for easing his mind and said that we could

consider the matter closed. Mr. Ichord was well-disposed

toward this Agency

from the onset and assured us that

anything

said or

shown to him would be held in strict

confidence. A more detailed memorandum is attached.
