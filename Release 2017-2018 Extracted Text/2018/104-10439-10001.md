who is knowledgeable on the OSWALD Case.

graphological assessment had not been cone to his knowledgo to determine

if personality restructuring had been attempted on OSWALD in the USSR.

Mr. Dooley questioner whether such an assessment would really make a

worthwhile or reliable contribution to the issue of OSWALD's notivation,

and warrant the time and expense involved; that if such in assessment

was atterpted in any fomal sort of fashion, the "official" results

may only add confusion to the motivation issue, since such results

would not have truly scientific validity. He noted that the samples,

to his recollection, represented varicus environmental conditions ranging

from nonal passport applications, to condensed diary notations and notes;

that a child's handriting changes from grade school to college as the

speed of notetaking increases and the pressure mounts. In this case you

are dealing with a disturbed mentality as well.

Based on his femilarity with the case Mr. Dooley feels that

OSWALD's motivation is largely explained in tenns of his neurotic background

his failure to achieve status, and his very deep resentment to all authority

After his stay in the Soviet Union; OSWALD's writings indicate that ho felt

neither society had much to offer; and in effect, he rejected both.

3.. Mr. Dooley noted that undoubtedly other factors come into play to

formulate OSWALD's idea to assassinate the President.

For example, OSkALD

saw a movie on TV about an attempted presidential assassination with a rifl.

shortly before his deed, which could have sparked him into action.

Warren Cormission has indicated, the real motive may never be known.

4.. Mr. Dooley said that the files are available for inspection by ani

SD officer at any time to look for handriting samples or any other purpose,

Intric vier of the above, he did not feel that anything could be proved for

anstain and therefore questioned the merit of the sugrestion at this timo.
