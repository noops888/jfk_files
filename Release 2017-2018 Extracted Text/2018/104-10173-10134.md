Mr. . A. Bleson
136 Claremont Avenue .
Mount Vernon, HN. Y.

Dear Mr. Biseon:

= I have eeen the correspondence exchanged between
ur., Olass: and yourself regarding thé contributions you
collected for the China Forum. A draft for the eum in
full will be sent to you thia week.

I do not know in the neme of whom or what Hiss Smedley

cpl

MY) soaet shge/ ¢ hp BEE

epéake of the China Forum. Since she wae not in China at

the time the Forum Suspended, nor nas shé corresponded
_with mo..on the subject, I consider it necessary to place
before you and the other contributors an account of the
circumstances in which the Yorum ceased: publication.
Since you apparently gathered the contributors together
in a meeting to hear what Mise Smedley had to say, I
would appreciate it deeply 4f you would gather them once
‘mors to-hear my account. Tho enclosed is a copy of a

letter sent by me last May to the Chinese Communist Party.

It. has been published tn China in a Chinese translation
and copies have been sent abroad but has not been pub-
lished in mnglish as fa¥-as-I know. I do not know the
names of the people who wera good enough to contribute
to the Forum but their interest in the matter warranta
placing before them the story of what happened to tha
magazine. I trust, out of @imple fairness to me,. you
will be good enough to give them this opportunity.

“1 "Y greatly regret any ‘inconvenience or embarrassment
to which you have been put in this matter. do hope,
however, that my letter will enlighten you. and your
friends and enable:you to appreciate the difficulties
which have arisen.. I know of no.project to revive the

China Forum‘at the. present time.. Should such occur, the

Yesultant. publication would be of a considerably different

oharacter from the one [ edited, as will be obvious from

the facta given in my letter-to the C. P.. I think people”

who are interested in supporting the revolutionary move-
ment here should know these facts.

Once again, I appreciate all the trouble you have
gone to in this matter.

Did you ever, incidentally, receive the article
*Fasclem in China’ and the newsletter which I mailed to
July 13 last?

Youre sincerely,

enol. : _ (Harold R. Isaacs)

To the Cent. Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:
The twonyear period of ay extra-organtzational cole

an-end and the China Forum which I founded and edited du
Ang that: time.bas been forced to suspend publication.- In
‘the: interest ‘of our. whole movement ad well as in my per=
gonal interest, I coneider it necessary to record here
and publiah the hietory of thé Ohina Forum and. the cir
cumstances of ite suspension. You refuded.me the oppor
tunity. to lay the matter before the membership of the
party even when I offered to do.eo in your own organs and
not through the columns of the Forum. khen, wrongly, [

“permitted the Forum to go down in silence, you turned

around and in your orgsns and near organs in China and
abroad you proceeded with the usual elanders of "betrayer®
and *counter-re’ olutionary”, in so doing you didn't have
the courage or the aisle honesty to state that you pre=
sented the China Forum with en ultimatum and forced its
suspénésion because in reply its editor raised. questions
which are being placed before the whole movement today
by the International Left Opposition. Nor did you etate
rately saashed the Forum for this reason
despite my reppated and oxtendéd offers to continue publi-
cation ag before-on.a straight enti-Kuomintang, anti-
imperxialist basie, Leaving these various problems to be
thrashed out first privately among ourselves. In other
worde, you deliberately forced. suspension of the China
Forua aa pite the fact, on your own admission, that ita
lose was a serious blow to the revolutionary movement in
tt -meant' the disappearance of an organ which
tor tw @ you had donéidered an extremely valuable
instrument in the hands of the movement. Here, as in the
broader Leduee which léd to our differences, your blind
adherenoe to false policies was once more demonstrative
of your Feadiness to place your factional anperotte above
the ansereste of the Chinese Revolution.

In going baok over the history of ths Forum, T think
thé vicious character of your action becomes evén more —
evident shen I start with the. fact that from beginning to
end I functioned not as a member of the party but as a
Liing eympathis: oo Was prepared to throw all hia
energies into a Job he saw he could do - edit and publish
an organ in China which could help mobilise the forces
of this country for struggle against the Kuomintang and
the imperialists by exposing the regime of terror and
privation shich they have in common imposed upon the
masees of the Chinese people. Perait me to recall at
thie point that I never accepted any personal aa, |

tion for time or labor. You gave the Forum financial
aid but I never received a dollar from you that was not
put into the paper. I refused your offere of compensa-
tion and earned my living elsewhere. Your only. clain on

our Common dedication to the struggle ayainet a regime
of bate and misery and oppression. In the end you for
foited this claim by ceasing any longer to be in ay eyes
bonest or-effective leaders of this struggle.

Although you helped the Yorum finanoially, the part
you played in building it up from toe day it started in
January, 1952, to the day of its last appearance in Janue
ary 1034, 8. insignificant. My repeated requesta for
cooperation in matters of circulation and material for
publication went largely. unsatisfied throughout that tine.
You never supplied me with the reporte Iso frequently _
and-urgently sought, particularly on trade uniona, strike
atrugglee, the Red Armies, the Red districts, etc. Svery-
thing the Forum did and became was the fruit of the work
of a tiny group of devoted collaborators (the most im i
portant of whom had no connection sith you whatever) and
pyself who had to depend almoet entirely on “our onn re-
sources for everything we did and published. at every
crisis in the Forun's existence, when it was banned by
the French authorities in Shanghai at the very outset;
when it was bounded and persecutéd by the American and
Chinese authorities in the summer of 1932, when through
British police pressure it was thrown out of every avail-

‘able printing ship in the city; wher the pacudo-Fascist

Blue &birts again and again threatened the printing plant
whioh I built up partially through personally contracted
loans -~ it was invariably through my own initiative, with
the help of the little Forum staff, that we pulled our-
selves up by the bootstraps every time and carried. on to
a@ point in January this’ year where the Forum waa flourish
ing and growing daily in circulation, prestige, and in-
fluence despite the many formidable obstacles in ite way.
The formation of the Chink Forum Readers Assootation.
which in the brief space of three months spread to eleven
cities in five provinces, developing into « mighty poten—
tial weapon for the revolutionary movement, was the prod-
uct of spontaneous action on the part of the Forun'a
¥eaders, later sponsored and led by the paper itself.

All these were the Forum's own achievements, not yours.

By your arbitrary and criminal action you shattered thea

in the full stride of their grovth. Because to ay bitter
disappointment. I had not_nor could I secure the resources il
to oarry on myself - owing largely to the difficult consi [
tiona of work and the impossibility of getting revenue

from the papax itself = all that had been aohleved and

was to be acnieved was ground into the dust.

qt.

From almost the very beginning of my aotive work -
which I date from the time I began reporting events in
China in a Communist way ~- a number of questions presented
themselves to-me in increasingly forcible form, These =e
arose originally from sy ‘discovery of the groas distor= {
tions and exaggerations whicn [ found to be characteristic ;
of Communist propaganda tn China and abroad. I define
propaganda as the skilful, clear, accurate and wholly
truthful reporting of the facts linked to sn incisive,

purposive


ode

purposive interpretation and a plan of action for deal~
ing with tho facte in a ‘revolutionary way. I learned —
“bis fieu sie 4ade “and work oF Lenin and his Bolshevik
Comrades sho tausht ue-that the truth comes from the.
masees themselvea and that only disnater can result fron
telling thea lies. £ bave.never learned to the contrary
that it wae my revolutionary duty to work in any other
way although I soon found that the present day Communist
Party press makes @ practice of dietingulehing between

propaganda and truth. Scere

I firet wrote these down to tae ignorance or inoavacity

of individuals. I felt that Communist editors abroad
would publish accurate facts about China if they could
get-them. Accordingly with a griend I tried to set up.

an independent mail news servioe and sent weekly bulletins
to papers all over the world Giving brief, sharp, factual’
accounts of what wae going on. This waa in the fall of .

1931 after my return from the area of the @Feat Central

China floods of that summer. | scarcely understood then
why this service failed to secure any reeponse from tha
Communist prees abroad. After about three monthe I had
to suspend it for lack of. support. It simply didn't got
published except in a few organs which were not official i]
Communist Party papers, including the New York Militant. fl

It wasn't long befora I began to perceive, with a
deeper etudy ‘of international events and the history of
the Chinese Revolution, that a consistent thread ran
through the distortions and exaggerations which I. found -
not only in brief casual reports of-current events but
in the solem pronunolamentoes. made by delegates before
plenume of the E.0.€.1.°{ discovered that these departures
from the truth vere made Necessary by the offictal premise ~
that ever eince the catastrophe of 1937 .a mighty, upsurg-
ing revolutionary movesent bas been marching forward in
China to the ‘very brink of seizure of power under the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. I discovered
that these exaggerations wers necessary because the prom
iee-vas false and along with it all the basic tenets of
the policies being pursued by the Communist International
and the Communist Party in China. I cannot begin here to
give a summary of some of these distortions (which I
verbally cited to you by the dozen) ranging from. particu~
lar incidents (the wilfully false picture given of the
cotton mill strixe in. Shanghai in January, 1932, even to
the point cf transposing it to February to beighten the
impression given of the workera' role in the Shanghai war)
to bigh flown generalizations like the statement recently
made before the Plenum of the §.C.C.I. that the C.C.7. has
won over the majority of the Chinese working class and

tae peasantry.
In donying the factual truth of thio premise, whence
flows the whole policy of the Communist Party in China, I
deprecate not a whit the sagnificent militancy and courage
of Chinese workers, striking again and again and fighting

: * againet


+

against terrific oddo in defenso of their very lives;

mor the noroio struggles waged by peasants all over the
Gountry; nor the fight of the Red Armiea against the
Kuomintang, -I. morely respect the cold, indisputable fact j
tbat these. etruggles are defensive, not offaneivo, that ]
they are isolated, desperate and unorganised. With very
few exoeptions - a few emall etrikes here and there and
the larger exoeption of the kéd Army = they are without
organized revolutionary leadership. Moreover the dévelop-
ment of this leadership, the taak of the C.P.; 18 proceed=
ing at a tragically retarded pace owing to the falee
policies and inept tactics of tne party.

Tn denyiag the présence of a mighty révolutionery
upsurge (1.6., a Vaat, organised march toward the seizure
of power) I respect facta made “etal clearer perhaps when
compared to the facts and figures of the monster mass move-
mente of the 1025-27 period. The! tragio errora of the
Communist leadership in 1927 were primarily regponsible
for the decapitation of that great movement and because
no lessons have been drawn from those eventa to this very.
day, these errors, monstrously acoumulated, aré still re-
6ponsible’ for the tragedies of today, ,But for the purpose
of our comparison here, let ug for exanplo take the single
fact that in 1926 in Greater Shanghai there were 257
strikes, In 1933 there were 82. Let us remember that
on the eve of the workers’ seisure of power in‘ Shanghat
in Maren, 1927, there vere more than 860,000" workers,
handioraftemen and petty traders out on the streets fight=
ing with arma ‘in lands for demands of a far-reaohing po- ,
litical character. A close oheok for the gutize countzy
in the latter half of 1933 ehowad me that Yeas than one-
thirtieth of that number were; engaged in etriken and other
disputes during ‘any given monta and that almost invariably
the demande wore deféngive demands againat wage outs and
locKouts. oreover; the lack of cohesive leadership - -
often in departments of the same factory or in‘one or more
ofa group of factories = or even sometines lack of even
the most elementary organization = hae in almoat every
cade led to deadening failure and rolatively easy. betrayal
‘by the yellow “labor lesders® and "mediators? of tho
‘Kuomintang...In 1925°the shooting of thirteen students
by Britiso police in Shanghai wae the touch-of? for a
@eneral strike which paralyzed the oity and ghioh was
‘econded by vaet sympathy strikes which broke like a
series of tidal waves over the entire country. In Janu-
ary, 1932, when the Japanese imperialists used the Shanghai
International Settlement as a base for opezationa which
cost the lives of tens of thousands of Chinese, not a
aingle strike interrupted the normal course of the pub-
lic or other services in that séttlement. In the factories
there were no strikes Lut a large sorle lockout to whioh
the overwheluing majority of Shengnalts workers submitted
without proteat.

fhe dogged, persistent struggle oorried on by emall
sections of the rank and file workera in isolated instances

in recent years is tribute to the magnificent fibre of
iH Chinese



-

Chinese workers, It is not evidence that a revolutionary
seizure of power is on the order of the day. It is evi-
dence, along with the heroto sacrifices of thousands who
hove lost lives and liberty in Ciinese revolutionary
struggle during the last seven years of Kuomintang re-
action, that. it {a vossible to fight the monstroua white
terror which Chinese Communists freouently cite asa
reason for the insufficiency of their work. Yet. it is
largely because thie terror has not been fought effectively
that the Kuomintang regime, desvite the fact that 1¢ is
rotting and crumbling, oan still keep the lid down on the
boiling, simmering hatred of the people it rul: Unle:
the martyrdom of thousands of China's finest workers,
jsante and revolutionary intellectuals is to be in vain,
we must turn resolutely away from the folly of calling to
insurrection when what 18 needed is painstaking education,
organization and the sponsorship of day-to-day struggles

“of the masses for. demooratic demands, the. slow building up

of a varty and mass organizations and a covenent which
will be able’ to command. the forces capable of. carrying out

an insurrection.

In the case of the widespread but isolated and in~
dividual cases of peasant uprisings, and thie includes
the Red armies in Kiangsi, these struggles await the
leadership of a strong working clase movement before they
can have a successful issue. The Red Armies in their re=
stricted and surrounded areas and with their meagre re~
sources have. fought heroioelly againet the Kuomintang
attacks upon then, But until the Kuomintang is shaken
from its bulwarks in the imperialist controlled working
olass. centres, their prospect of revolutionary triumph
remains necessarily dim. No revolutionery purpose ia
served by taking refuge in the fiotion that these armies
have vroletarien leadership because individual vorkers,
eundoubtedly leaders of superior quality and courage, have
een torn from their fadtories and their fellow-workers ~
and sent down to gccuvy key positions in the Red Army
districts and in the Red armies themselves. Indeed, this
Common practice of extracting the most conscious and pro=
gressive working class elements from their working olass
environment and sending them down to the Red districts ie
a good index to the oriminal transposition of emphasis
which has helped paralyze the working class movement in
the oities. If the White Terror doesn't carry off the
workers’ leaders as they arise, the C.P..does and has done
so in hundreds of cases. This helpe in no 6mall part to
explain why it has also been impossible to mobilize a
genuine mass anti-Japanese movement in the fect of mili- |
tary aggression and why the Hhite Terror of the Kuomin-
tang has sucoseded, by filling mass graves and innumer-
able prisons with the martyred dead and living, in domn-
ing the anti-imperialist movement or efforts toward the
organization of such a movement and paving the way for
the ever increasing enoroachments of the impertaliate.
The varty has not yet grinned and directed the deep and
bitter and often inarticulate hatred of the masses of the
peovle for their oppressors and thia inoludes large a¢o~-
tions of the lower vetty bourgeoisie who could be won by
eucceseful mace pressure from below. This 1a because the

Party


er ee

Party hao failed to translate the realities of everyday

evente into its program and tacvica.. :

I oannot here go into the many-faceted problems and
issues which flow from these facts with regard to the
poliotes and tactica of the Chinese revolutionary movement,
Nor extending to:the international scene need I go {nt6
the terrifio effects of the German catastrophe nor the
storm of questions which: has been direoted at the-C.t.-—
leadershiv whose responsibility in the disaster has be-
come nakedly clear to unnusbered Comuunists and Comminist
symosthizers the warld over. Nor into the whole set: of ~
faplicattons which arise from the policies of the O:I.j
with particular reference to the late developments in
Soviet foreign polioy, the Litvinov-Roosevelt agreement,
the forthooming mooted entrance of the U.S.3.R. into the
: League of Nations and in a enaller but equally oharaster-
HE fetio way, the forthcoming association of ‘the U.S.8.R.

with the Institute of Paoifto Relations whioh hopes to
hold ite next talkfeet in Yosccw. These problema, with

their many soecifio links to the Chinese questions, were- —~-

the basic questioné over which I soon. began to take issue
with the offioial views of the Party and the International.

: : Til.

i But vrecisely because at all costs I desired to carry
on the Yorum's oven struggle agninst the common enemy ~
‘agsinat the Kuomintang and the imperialists - I sedulously
avoided bringing these issues into the colusns of the paper,
Anoreasingly against my better judgment. 1 leaned over far
backward in thia respect. This expreseed itself in many

of the current tesues with which we had to deal.

Forum waged on behalf of. Paul. and Gertrud Ruegg in the
bpring and summer of 1932 during, which time I repeatedly
‘warned against the emohasis which was being placed on the

7 Slégal* aspects of the case and the ‘negotiations® with
the Kuomintang to the detriment of mass vressure ‘and the
Capitalization of thé case for political nurvoses. You
paid lip service to the need for mass vressure - partiou~
larly here in China’= dut in fact the “legalities® and
futilé negotiations remained the wajor pillars of the de~

‘ense. Until in the very end I finally rebelled, I waan't

even permitted to give Ruegg his honourable and rightful
title - secretary of the Pan Pacific Trade Union Seore—
tariat. Yat, although I felt the struggle for the Ruegga
was being aeriously bandicavved"by the tactics being pur-

' gued, I carried on the fight with all the energy at my

! gommand and you will recall that it was I who oreated the

looal defense committee. and was ohiefly resvonsible for
the widesoread press propagenda and the considerable
symnathy which we eroused. Yet the etrictly non-political

' attitude whioh Ruegg wae forced to assume at the trial

: ‘(in contrast to the highly political at.ituce of his

| prosecutore) wae in my opinion one of the major reasons

for

122.2 geek you.to-reoall the whole uobill fight which the


* regime.

is 7
for the fate to whivh he. and hie wife were condemned.

I ask you to recall the whole neriod of the organtsaq,
tion end aotivities of the China-Lesgue for Civil Righta, |
from December, 1932, to June, 1933, in which I took. an
notive part. I.gave full vlay to this hybrid League and 1
its vork without. once publishing the basto critiotans :
whioh J. often. voiced’ to you and whioh in the end were t
wholly confirmed by what hapnened after the Kuomintang
murdered Yang‘Chien in Juné that. year. ‘

1 ask you to racall.the views [ set forth in August.
and Séntember, 1933, on the subject of the "anti-War Con-
grees" which at your specific request I did not publish,
Instead, to my regret, I published the foul rot of Mare
ley & Co., without freely giving play to the true facta

about that faroical junket which had convinced me that
the policies which gave it birth do not.one single whit

advance the international struggle ageinat imperialist
war. nl

HE On one occasion ~ and this at least I can take dom
fort in I passively reeisted when you requested me to
write and publish a slanderous attack on Chen~Tu-hoit
when he was condemned to. 13 years joprieonnent by the
Kuomintang. Your request was snecific. I was not to;
deal with the issues which had brought Chen Tu-heiu from
being the leader of the C.P. in 1927 to being leader of
the Chinese Opposition in 1933. I was only to string to+
gether a vile series of labela in an effort to exzolain
why the Kuomintang even. imprisoned the leader of. the
Left Opvoeition. Ags you know, that attack was never
eritten or published. ; :

: Again in December, 1933, upon my return from Fuki
you specifically demanded ‘that I set aside the result
my own versonal investigations in Foochow in order to;
write on your behalf (but over my signature!) an utterly
baseless and slanderous attack on tha Left Opnosition.

You will recall that you charged at that time that. the.
"Trotekyiate* were prominently identified with the new
governzent set uo in Sikien by Chen Ming-ebu and Teal’

demanded that I ignore my own knowledge of the wan and in
my article on Fukten set hina down as a “Trotskyist®. I
wae faced on the -one hand by your demands thst I write
falsehoods to suit your policies and on the other by my
deen desire to forth the actual facts about the Oppo-
“gitton's attitude towards the Fukien regize. But once
more, ‘to vreserve the shreds of our relationship, I drove :
a niddle course and did neither, leaving the whole question. ss |

out of my article.

Despite the facta that these issues weighed more and
more heavily upon me, despite the faot. that events in
China and abroad were pressing themselves sore and more
imperatively on the-ooncerns of every sincere revolution-
ary, I atill trisd :to.keep the Forum balanced on its
ribbon-like path, concentrating on the anti-Kuomintang,
enti-inverialiat struggle, and in 80 doing fulfilling at
least a partial function as a revolutionary organ. f
deeply felt, however, that I was betraying wy readers by
avoiding these iseues. How could I write of Germany and
avoid all the imolications of that disaster? How could
I write of America's recognition of the U.S.5.R. and still
fail to say that. the Communist International had virtually
been murdered ‘at Washington? -How oould I warn against the
dangere of imverialiet ‘atervention in the U.5.S.R. and
still not point out. that Soviet foreign policy was in
fact daily heightening the denger of such intervention?
Yet I somehow did eo and sought in whatever way possible
to retain some basié.for our continued collaboration.

iv. iaieaneaeey we oa ots

Wevertheless, abruptly in January of this year you
forced ‘an ultimatum upon me and subsequently forced the
break in-our relationship because I could not and vould
not, at your demand, devote the China Forus to polictea
which I could not end do not believe compatible with the:
interests of the Chinese Revolution and the international
proletarian revolution. I could not, at your demend, set.
aside the convictions to which I had literally been driven
by the stinging lash of catastrophic, events in China,
Germany and the world over. Parttoularly ay deep inter- ‘
est in Chinese events during the last three years made it

- {mvossible for me, finally, to give active support to
volicies and tactica whose disastrous effects were being
a thousandfold confirmed for me by the tragic events of
every owiftly-vassing day.. I gould not ignore questions
which strike at the roote of our work and the whole struo-
ture of our hopes for a revolutionary future.

Despite the fact that these questions are rocking
the entire International today, you denied ay right to

raise


-% :

raise them in print. You desanded more. You demanded
- that I attsok anybody who did so - primarily the peovle 7
you oall “counter-revolutionary Trotekyists® - the only :
peopte who are fsoing these problema today in o fearless,
revolutionary way. fou demanded that the China Forus
become a stereotyve for the volicies and vulgar faction-
cS al slanders which I could neither then nor now be party
inauriene “aauatat to. In reply to my questions on China you simply quoted :
back tome the lies snd half-lies I've been so used to © . -
reading in Inprecorr. You even d@eclaréd: “For propa-
ganda purposes a-certain amount of exaggeration is neces~
sary... and went on anasingly to say: *pbut we know the
true facts and we base our. policies on them, not on these
exaggerations!* A new Slant on modern-day 6.4. tactioa!
a Facts, you said, are curious things. They have to be
Ga turned around and around and around and examined closely
unt{l their true nature becomes apvorent. The trouble 1s
you turn them eo far and so quickly that thoy turn into
something like a dizaily turning top of. fancy — or at
pest wieh — fulfilling misrepresentations.

fo my questions on Germany you. quoted Heckert,
Piatniteky, and the 2.0.C.I.'e famour resolution deolar-
ing that the collapse of the German party and the slaughter
of the German workers were based on the past present and
_future correct policies of the 0.P.0.! You declared I had
a . ‘no right, to offer critical coment on the dangerously
2 opnortunistic foreign and doaeatio policies of the U.S.9.R.,

most notably on the entry of the U.3.9.R. on a straight

“nationalist basia into the disgusting corridors of tn~
perialist intrigue. To'the contrary, I was to lovingly
famningly fondle and hail the volioies which have meant
disaster in China, Germany and elsewhere ond are rapidly

a leading: the U.3.3.R. into the vacuun of nationalist iso~

jation from -the world wide proletarian movement. This I z
was to.do,.to begin with, by oublishing Stalin's face on
the. front pare and colunins of the cuatomary, panegyrice ~
to his infallibility. Above all and before all, I was to
take uv oudgels. against ‘“counter-revolutionary Trotekyiem®. .
That waa to bg the sain point of my reformation ~ to raise raat
no questions myself and ‘slander anybody else who did 80.

Ia ‘reply to your demand that I submit to an editorial
board in-order that these editorial policies should be.
effectively put into practice, 1 offered (1) to continue
publication striotly ‘as before, meanwhile arguing out my.
differences. with you.in discussione on the side; (2) to
throw the columne of the Forum onen to a general discus- 7
sion of all basic revolutionary question, with free play
to unorthodox as well as orthodox views. If your views :
were correct, I argued, {it would be a distinct advantege *
to you to have such an opcortunity to display their tril-
liance alongside the puny efforte of your critios; (3) to
publish orthodox news. and views but to reserve for myself
the right to comsent snd oriticise.

these repeated offers you reveatedly refused. You
offered to discuss these questiona with me verbally if in

the


-10 : +

the seanvhile I throw the Forun oven to your editorial
do: My other provogala were unthinkable! Givo tha
Forua's readers a.chance to hear Sounter-revolutionary®

n. Yiewwoints? Never that! I could only display ay revo-

“. Qutiosary purity by acceding to your demands. We would
talk things over until Spring, then if all went well. (1.0.,
if Iehowed a:aatisfactory adavtability to your view-

me point) I could pack up for an educational trip to the

c Soviet Union where I would certainly become convinced
of the error of my ways. In other words you wanted my
signature on a promissory note with the amount left
Dlank for you to fill in. You put this in the form of

* an ultimatum and you told me that if I-did anything but .

-accert I would forthwith enter the camp of the “oounter-
revolution". .

-I-had to refuse these terms. I had to refuse to
lend ayself to a slanderous and baseless struggle against -
the International Left Opoosition. I had to refuse to
lend space to the nauseatingly fawning praise of Stalin
and unoritical reception of Stalinist polioies which
characterise the Communist Party press the world -over.

I had to refuse to take shelter in the cold and draughty
eapty spaces which stretch behind the impressive facade
"and early tradition of the Communist International. I
would like to go to the Soviet Union for a vist Bomeday ~
but I had to refuse your offer on your terms. I had to
refuse, in bhort, to become a hack vrostitute in the name

of the Revolution.

In the end; too, I had to refuse to turn over to you
the printing plant { had built uv with so much pain and
Struggle because I considered it not your proverty but
the vroverty of the working class movement. Because I
could not oarry on the Forum myself, for l2ok of finan-

» Gfal resources and because of heavy debts contracted, I

‘~-+-~ disposed of “the. plant and turned every farthing of the

proceeds over to where I now consider the true interests
of our movement lie. It was with e deep and abiding bite
terness that I had considered comrades, when for two years
it bed fought off all ita many enemies on the outside.

Yet with 1 camo the realization that we have to
bulla anew over the ruins you have wrought. The revolue
‘tion“and the building of our future moves. forward and
when we trample down the defenses of our enemies we shall

“*- eruah underfoot everything and everybody that stands in
our way. Ho sycophantic, blind, allegiance to a name, an
eupty fadade, a torn and shredded prestige can lead us
forward. Only unewerving fidelity to our geal and active
Struggle towards this end with the weavons of a correct
and tested political line will lift us from defeat to ul-
timate victory. To this struggle I shall continue to

dedicate ‘all my energies.

2. For the past few years Subject has been working on an international
Study series involving ninority recial groups. His reports have been
published in the New Yorker magazine and ao books, The New World of
Americans and India's Untolchables, Subject plans to publish ta August 7
1957 a book on the American Jews in Icreel and 1s working oa another on
the Philippines.

3. WUSPARROW/1 first mot Subject in 19k6 after he had. just completed
long and friendly interview with Ho Chi Minh aa Far Kast correspondent
for Rewsweek. At that time, Subject felt that the United States was making
@ mistake In not accepting Ho as the leader of a united Vietnaz, fooling
that Ho was independent enough of China to make him at worst a sort of
Tito.

“4. Subjact presently is despairing of United States foreign relations
in that our people ‘fron Washington, or elsewhere, selda: seea to establish
9 deep rapport with Asian or African nationals, Subject feels-that such
relations as do exist never reach more than an ineffective superficial

level,

5. Subject first vent to the Far East about 1930 when he wes a crew
member of the Matson Line's Malolo and disenbarked at Honolulu to work for

the Honolulu Advertiser. (WUSPARROW/2.vent to work for the cone paper tvo.
years later.) Subject went next to tha Philippines where he warked on a
Manila daily. While in Yanila he was offered the editorship of the Bangkok
Royal Mail, to fill in for-St, Clair McELNAY, now of the Kew Yorzer,

then Joined the Newsweek. foreign staff. Subject wes in and out of

Bangkok efter World War IT and WUSPARROW/1 becawe friendly with hia.

According to WUSPABROW/1, many people. regard Subject’s Tragedy of the

From: John I, Coddington
Subject: HAROLD ROBERT Isaacs

Mr. GSORGE N. KATES of 0535. Fh, has Just returned to the United States
from Chungking. He reached ifashington yesterday. He claims to have known
HAROLD: ROBERT ISAACS quite woll in Chunkine, and hes‘ the following observations
to make concerning ir. ISAACS;

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS 10 about 35 years of age. Ho attended Columbia
“ ” University, and received the degros of A.B. there in 1930. He 48 tho son of

‘an orthodox Jewish merchant, who 1a very wealthy, and who has always supported

HAROLD, ean though fie did not. approve of the radical views that HAROLD expressed

in the 1930's,
HAROLD went to China imdiately after graduition from Coluwbia, partly,

: " atleast, out of a desire to sce strange parts of the world and to experience
"adventure." He went out by way of. Hawaii, and stowed away for part of the
voyage, —- either betwaan San Francisco ord Honolulu, or between Honolulu and

“s-Shanghad — Me, KATSS does not Fenduber which, inner, this was part of the || :

“adventure,”
In China, HAROLD met a South ‘African named FRANK GLASS, who was an “intellectual 0

ssi “OS “and a very interesting person. ciass was a Leftist, but’ not at all a Cotmundst .
HAROLD took a trip up the Yangtse with GLASS in 1930 or 1931, At about this timo, |

HAROLD becane a ¢onvert: to’ Trotekyisa, partly, at least, under GLASS's influence. °
He felt that “suffering huianity* required a "revolution" to set things straight. |

Conrainism was too organized, and HAKOLD wos a complete individual iat, and reactod
and 80 espoused Trotskyism,

strongly against the organizational set—up of Communion,
He returned to Shanghai from the western part of China, and went to work for

who.was, like HARCLD, a wide-eyal intellectual, This maurrisge protsbly took place
4m 1932, VIOLA was a great friend of cuss SIGDLEY, the author of the Battle ym,
of Chins and of other books dealing with the Chinese Revoiutien,

4n organization called the China League for Civil Rights was formed about

_ 1932. YANG CHT was the head of this for Central China, and Dr. HU SHIN (later
~ Chinese ambassador to Washington) wes the head-of it for North China, YANG was at

that tine Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica. YANG was soon assassinated
by the Blue Shirts (at that time CHIANG KAI-SHEK's bodyguard). HAROLD ISAACS had
been an enthusiastic:nember of tha Chins League for Civil Rights, and in the

. ~aleosphere of turmoil, after the killing of YANG, when all Leftists were under

attack by the Kuomintang, HAROLD becams the editor and publisher of the China Forum,
§ magazine that published a number cf controversial articles, The magazine was
protected by the fact that the editor was an American, and therefore had extra
territorial rights. Yot the magazine ws regirded as a “thorn in the flesh" by Hr.
CURIA, who was at that tino Amrican Consul-General in Shanghai. There were
various controversies — the printing shop was broken up by Xuosdntang strong-arm
men; the mils were refused to the magasing; but he contimed publication for some
tino, and smuggled the copies out to the subscribers,

In 1933 or. 1934, ISAACS bad s fight with AGNES SYSDLSY. Tt was an ideological
fight, ard therefore especially bitter, ISAACS and his wite left ‘Slanghat after
this, and moved'to Peking. There he sequined @ Chinese translator named LU, and

This book “nails the Stalinists to the mst" ani shows that they were messing
around with a situation in China which they did not understand. Very many People

who have read the book consider it excellent,

The book wags completed, and ISAACS and his wife returned to the United States
about April or lay 1935, Inmediately after this, ISAACS mde a papid trip to
Oglo, Norway, to see his hero, LEON morsKy, who was Living there at that time,

Te. was on this occasion that he must have undertaken to translate TROTSKY'a book,

HAVAS News Agency once more,

and he worked hard for NORMAN THOMS.
By 1940, however; ho became disgusted with New York Politics, and became
interested in tho war, an inibourgoois life." te and his wife had ababy at

S6on after this, ho Joined the state of News-tieek, and in 1944 was sent to Chungking

Thére must have been 8 certain amount of trouble in convincing

a firmly convinced Trotskyist. in his youth, and remined one t22 the time of

“SS. Because he has disavowed the principles of world revolution, turned away from
Trotekyte teachings, and since 1939 hes’ been writing patriotic propaganda for the

United States Government,
He wert to China about 1930, and wrote two books dealing with Chinese

i politics, Fire Years of Kuomintang Reaction (1932), and The Tragedy of the Chinesa

point of view. Tho first was publisted in Shanghal, and tho second in London.

Neither was ever published in the United ‘States, and ISAACS eaid that the Syeecutrs

Stalinist Commnistd were 80 powerful in this country that they were able ‘to

prevent the publication of the Tra, Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution here. This

book received high Preise from many serious students of Far Eastern affairs,
