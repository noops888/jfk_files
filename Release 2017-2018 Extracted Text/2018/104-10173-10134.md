Since she was not in China at

before you and the other contributors an account of the

carcumstances in which the Forun consed publication.

Binoe you apparently gathered the contributors together

In a meeting to bear what Mias Bmedley had to say, I

would appreciate it deeply 18 you would gather then once

To the Central Committee of she Chinese Communist Party:

The two year period of my extra-organizational 0ol

laboration with the Chinese Commniat Party bas come to

an end and the China Forun which I founded and edited dun

ing that 3ime bee been forced to suspend publication. In

the interest of our whole movement as well as in my per-

sonal interest, I conelder 1t necessary to record here

and publiah the hletory of the Obina Forum and the olr

cumstances of ite suspension.

You refuded me the oppoi

tunity to lay the matter before the memberablp of the

party even when I offered to do so in your own organs and

not through the columns of the forum.

Fren, rongly, I

permitted

the forum to go down in silence,

you turned

around and in your organs and near organs

in China and

abroad you proceeded mies the usual slanders of

In so doing you didn't have

the courago or the

flaple honesty to state that you pre-

sented the China Forun with an ultlmatim and forded 188

suspension because in raply its editor ralsed questions

whlod are beinr placed before the whole movement today

by the International

Left Opposition.

Nor did you state

that you dollerately anasbed the Forum for this reason

despite my repeated

and extended offers to continue publi

cation as before on a agraight anti- Kuomintang,

anti-

Imperiallet bagle,

leaving tbese varlous problems to be

Here, as in the

broader lisues which led to our differences, your blind

adherence to false policles was once more demonatrative

of your readiness to place your factional interests above

she interesta of the chinese Revolution.

In golng baok over the history of the Forum, I think

the violoue character of your aotion becomes even more

evident when I start wish the fact that from beginning to

end I functioned not as a member of the party but as a

wiliing sympatbiser who was prepared to throw all hla

energles into a job he saw he could do - edit and publiah

•Subject: HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS

Mr. GORGE N. KATES of 033, Rich, has just rotured to the United Statos

from Chungking. He reached Hashington yesterday. He claime to have known

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS quite well in Chungking, and has the following observations

to make concerning Mr. ISAACS:

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS 1a atout 35 Jears of age. Ho attended Columbia

University, and received the dezroe of A.B. there in 1930. He 18 tho son of

an orthodor jowish norchant, who is very wealthy, and who has almays supported

HAROLD, even though he did not approve of the radical views that HAROLD expressed

In the 19301g.

HAROLD went to China Imediatoly after graduation from Columbia, partly,

atleast, out of a desire to see atrange parts of the morld and to experience

"adventure." He went out by way of Harall, and stowed away for part of the

voyage - either betwean san Pranciaco and Honolulu, or between Honolulu and

Shanghal - Mr. KATES does not remember which. Anyway, this was part of the

"adventure." -

In China, HAROLD met a South African named FRANK CLASS, who was an "Intolloctual"

and a very interesting person. GA33 wes a Leftlat, but not at all a Coimunist.

HAROLD took a trip up the Yangtae with GLASS in 1930 or 1931. At about this timo,

HAROLD becanie a convert to protokylan, partly, at least, under GlAssis inifluenco.

Ho felt that "suffering humanity" required a "revolution" to set things straight.

Corunism was too organized, and fOLD was a complete individualist, and reactod

strongly agninst the organizationei set-up of Communial, and 80 espoused Trotskylan,

in organisation called the Gina league for üivil Rights was formed about

1932. YANG CH' IN was the head of this for Central Chins, and Dr. HU SHIN (later

Chirese imbassador to rashington) was the head of it for North China. YANG was at

that tino Secretary-General of the deademia Sinica. YANt was soon assassinated

by the Blue Shirts (at that time GIUG KNI-SEK's bodyguard). HAROLD ISHACS had

been an enthusiastic nember of the cins League for Civil Rights, and in the

atrosphere of turmoil, niter the killing of YANG, shen all leftists were under

attack by the Kuonintans, HAPOLD becasa the editor and publisher of the China Forun,

a magasine that published a number of controversial articles. The magazine was

protected by the fact that the editor was an American, and therufore had extra-

torritorial rights. Yet the magazine was regarded as a "thorn in the flesh" by tr.

CUNNIH, who was at that time durican Consul-General in Shanghal. There were

various controversies - the printing shop as broken up by kuanintang strong-arm

men; the mils were refused to the ragazine; but he continued publication for

some

tin, and smugaled the copies out to the subseribers.

In 1933 or 1934, ISLACS bad & fight with AGNES SIALSY. It was an ideological

right, and therefore especially bitter. IslAGS and his wife left Slanghas aster

this, and soved to Paking. There he acquired a Chinose translator named LIU,, and

thero he settled down to wrlte his back, The Tragddy of the Chinese Fevolution.

This book "nails the Stalinists to the maste and shows that they were messing.

around with a situation in China which they did not understand. Very many people

who have read the book consider it erellent.

The book was completed, and ISAACS and his wife returned to the United States

about April or May 1935, Inmediately after this, ISAACS rade & papid trip to

Oslo, Norway, to see his hero, LioN TROTSKY, uho mas living there at that time.

It was on this occasion that ho mist have undertaken to translate TROTSKY'a book,

Whither France? ISIACS then returned to New York, and went to work for the

HAVAS News Agency once more.

At some timo in the lato 1930's, ho became interedted in New York polities,

and he worked hard for NORMAN THOMAS.

By 1940, however; ho became disgusted with New York politics, and became

interested in the war, and in"bourgeola life." He and his vifo had a baby at

about this time (their firat), and ISAACS found he could write radio scripts and

Get good money for them. Up to 1940, he had been living chiefly off his father,

but from 1940 on, ho begar to mike money. In 1942, he did & "Report to the Nation"

for CBS.

Soon aster thie, he Joinad the Stärt of News-lleck, and in 194i was sent to Chungking

by that nagazine. Theire naust have been a certain amount of trouble in convincing

the Chirese Central Goverment that ISLACS had really changed since the old days

In Shanghai, but this convication was evidently accomplished, or ISAAGS rould not

have received permission fron the Chirinse Covernment to go to China.

In China in his presert capacity during the sumer of 1944, probably in July.

Subjecò was born In 1910, and 1s a member of a wealthy family. He became

a firmly convinced Brotskylst in his youth, and remined one t1ll the time af

PearlHarbor. He is now regarded as a renegade by his former Trotskyist callengues,

because he has disavowed the principles

of world revolution, turned away from

Trotsky's teschings, and since 1939 has been writing patriotic propaganda for the

United States Government.

He merit to China about 1930, and wrote two books dealing with Chinese

politics, lisa Years of Kuomintans Reaction (1932); and The Tragedy of the Chinese

Revolution (1938). Both of these volumes axpressed the author'a trotskylat

point of view. The first was publlahed in Shanghal, and the second in London.

Neither was ever published in the United States, and ISAACS sald that the

Stalinist Countst were so powerful in this country that they mere able to

provent the publication of the Tragedy af the Chinese Revolution here. This

book received high praise from many serious students of Far Eastern affaire,

Including G.P. Fudson, Pollow of All Souls College at Oxford, and author of.

written on the Chinese Revolution. Hudson is now an official of the British

Pron a curory perusual of these editions, the "nation"s political poller appears

to bd a socialistic nature, openly professing oppositon to the Republican and Democratic
