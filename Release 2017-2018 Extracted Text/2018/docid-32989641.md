The Attorney General

NOTE: ;

SSC made general request for information concerning FBI
mail surveillances in a letter dated May 14, 1975. This request
was later amplified in a June 13, 1975, letter. Response to
this request was deferred since Department of Justice was conducting
inguiry into mail openings by FBI. By memorandum August ‘8, 1975,
Mr. Shaheen of the Department advised of special procedures which
were to be followed in responding to mail opening requests. Since
that ‘time we have delivered all material relating to the "Hunter"
project which was a mail surveillance by CIA. The LEM enclosed
with our letter to the Attorney General contains additional
responses concerning eight mail surveys involving interception
and opening of mail by the FBI. It is noted that SSC request
for names of all individuals who participated in mail openings
is not being complied with. They are being told we do
have such a list available although it is not considered
complete. We feel access to such a list by SSC staff at this
time should be specifically authorized by the Department.

"The Daily World," an East Coast Communist News-
paper, in its issue dated March 17, 1970, contained an article
concerning a discussion of the Philadelphia Social Science
Forum held at the Hotel Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa. The
topic of the discussion was the Women's Struggle for Libera-
tion. Among the speakers was one MAR ce CALL, who identified

herself as from "Women's Liberation:

The District Committee of the Communist Party (CP)
of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware met in Philadelphia on
August 9, 1970. At that meeting an announcement was made that
the CP would have a table at the rally of the Women's -Libera-
tion group to be held in Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia on
August 26, 1970. It was stated at this meeting that the CP |
had been invited to participate in the Women's Liberation Move-

because of dissension among its members,

While a member of NOW she reportedly met MAREEN
JASON who went with SOKEITOUS into the new organization,
POWER. JASON arranged for POWER to use the telephone number
and address of 928 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, as a
telephone listing and a mailing address. "New Mobe" also
has an address at 928 Chestnut Street and JASON arranged for
that organization to do the printing for POWER at a reduced
rate.

SOKEITOUS and others began organizing immediately
for a Women's Rights Day rally to be held in Rittenhouse
Square, Philadelphia, on August 26, 1970. Their only pur-
pose was to call attention to the need for equal employment
rights for women. Most of the details of organizing the
rally were taken over by JASON since SOKEITOUS and others
did not have the time to devote to it and lacked the necessary
organizational ability.

When SOKEITOUS and her associates arrived at Ritten-
house Square for the rally on August 26, 1970, they were
shocked to see organizations such as the CP, the SWP, and the
Black Panther Party (BPP) all represented there and all dis-
tributing literature.

A characterization of the BPP is contained
in the appendix hereto.

JASON made no attempt to conceal from the members
of POWER that she was a member of the SWP and stated that she
would be departing for Houston in the near future.

The fourth floor at 928 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia,
where POWER has its headquarters, is shared by a number of or-
ganizations to whom the telephone and rental expvenses are pro-
rated. These other organizations are thefold Flower Brigade,

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)
aka

Black Panther Party for Self Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP was started
during December, 1966 in Oakland, California, to organize black people so they
can take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and. HUEY P. NEWTON, Minister
of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther", regularly states
that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolution-
ary program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an article by
the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY. This article ended with the
following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America, revolt
everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968 had an article introduced
with the following statement: "We will not dissent from American government.
We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the San Francisco
Polo Field on November 5, 1969, said nye will kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times't, issue of December 13, 1969
was quoted as follows: "We advocate the very direct overthrow of the govern~
ment by way of force and violence.!

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had an article by
Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:

$
3



sists bec

"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking up
arms against this government, killing the officials, until
the reactionary forces...are dead, and those that are left
turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby passing
revolutionary judgement against the number one enemy of all
mankind, the racist U. S. government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street, Oakland,
California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to Combat Fascism, under
control of the BPP, have been established in various locations in the USA.

. STUDENT MOBILIZATION COMMITTEE, aka
Student Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam;
National Student Mobilization Committee

‘A solirce advised on May 16, 1969 that the Student Mobilization
Coumittee originally grew out of the National Student Strike for Peace confer-
ence held in Chicago, Illinois, on December 28-29, 1966, which resulted in a-
call for massive antiwar demonstrations in New York City and San Francisco,
California, on April 15, 1967. The National Student Strike for Peace was
originally called by the Communist Party. Divisions arose between elements
of the Communist Party and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), eulminating in
a takeover by the SWP element in the Summer of 1968 and the Communist Party
element withdrawing. Source further advised the Student Mobilization Committee
locally and nationally is controlled by the SWP and its youth arm, Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA), as evidenced by their participation in Student
Mobilization Committee functions and their leadership role played in the
Student Mobilization Committee.

The SWP has been designated ee to Executive Order 10450.

A report by the Committee on Un-American Activities, House of
Representatives, Ninetieth Congress, First Session, dated March 31, 1967,
entitled, "Communist Origin and Manipulation of Vietnam Week (April 8-15,
1967)" stated that the Student Mobilization Committee and the April 15, 1967
anti-war demonstrations were communist dominated and inspired.

A second source on April 3, 1969 made available a copy of "The
Student Mobilizer" dated April 5, 1969, which was self-described as being
published by the National Office of the Student Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam, 857 Broadway, Room 307, New York, New York 10003. In this
issue the aims of the Student Mobilization Committee were set forth as: Bring
the GIs home from Vietnam now; end campus complicity with the war; and win
self-determination for Vietnam and Black America.

In this issue of the publication, the Student Mobilization
Committee pledged itself to organize high school students, college students,
future draftees, GIs and all young people + to fight until every last GI is
brought home. :

New York teletype stated leaflet was distributed at
Women's Center, 36 West 22nd Street, New York City, captioned,
"About a Meeting of Revolutionary Women for..." Leaflet stated
in part, "Some of the suggestions we've discussed for raps are
things like - what do we really mean when we say women's revo-
lution - what are its priorities - what are the pros and cons of
collective living for women - are we ready for a group offensive
~- what forms can it take?..." and "because we are committed to
social revolution (underlining supplied) meaning we know that in
our form of oppressive, racist, sexist society, any real change
without revolution is impossible." :

New York teletype further stated that a reliable source
“advised on 10/22/70, that one JEANETTE at the given New York
telephone number had said that “Revolutionary Women's Convention"
was being held on a farm in Limerick, Pd. The telepho: € number
FA 6-3008 in Limerick was given for transportation to the farm.
JEANETTE said the announcement for the convention was made at a

WLM meeting in New York City on 10/12/70.

: On 10/22/70, Lt. GEORGE FENCL, Civil Disobedience Unit,
"Philadelphia, Pa., Police Department, had one of his police
women make a pretext telephone call tothe New York number. She
talked to a woman who identified herself as LEE. LEE said each
attendee should expect to contribute $1.00 and should bring food
and wine. She said two films would be shown, one on abortion
and the other on an actual sex act being performed. The film on
the latter subject was to be narrated by one of the women who
participated who would describe her feelings at the time. They
also planned a guerilla theater called, "Burning City." LEE said
to the caller that since the caller was from Philadelphia would
she contact the "Plain Dealer" to let them know about this affair
and to have them promote it. The "Plain Dealer" is a Philadelphia
underground newspaper. .

According to an article appearing in the "Pottstown
Mercury," Pottstown, Pa., on 6/25/51, a 120 acre farm near
Fagleysville, Pa., had been purchased by a national organization
to ease racial and religious intolerance and to study other
social problems. The farm to be called~Fellowship Farm had been
owned by a wealthy eccentric Pottstown citizen.

Also referred to as~Fellowghip House docording to
the article, the farm would be open to students of junior and
senior high school age who had used the area in the past for
meetings. Fellowship House is sponsored by the Society of

engage, but also supported by leaders of all denominations,
rding to the article. There were at that time 15 Fellow-
ship Houses in the country following the establishment of the
movement in 1931. Fellowship House acquired Fellowship Farm,
according to a spokesman, "because we simply overflowed all
available places in Philadelphia."

SA W. RICHARD THIRLWELL and SA JOHN C.F. MORRIS
surveyed the area at Fellowship Farm in the early hours of
10/25/70, and cruised through at first light. They obtained
the license numbers from cars parked in the parking area,
observing a number of people sleeping in sleeping bags on the
ground near the cars. Following this they gave a ride to a
white female, age about 55, who said she was an early riser and
was out looking for coffee and cigarettes. Agents took her to
the Limerick Diner for breakfast. She later introduced herself

. as PHYLLIS: - SCHUYLER, nee Harlow, from New York City. She said

yoy members of WOMEN'S LIBERATION had gathered at the farm for a
weekend of discussions. Agents listened to her talk for about
40 minutes without revealing their identity. She talked
incessantly about women's rights, exploitation, unfair salary

so schedules, the need for better, cheaper medicine for all, the
evils of military industrial complex which contributes to the
exploitation of women, the necessity for ending the stigma
attached to homosexuals of both sexes, and the need to erase
social pressures against illegitimate children.

aia a BA

Mrs. SCHUYLER seemed to be hung up on sex. She said
there were a number of lesbians at the camp who had put up
posters "Lesbians Unite." The avowed lesbians shared quarters
somewhat separated from the other women. Mrs. SCHUYLER has an
aversion to lesbians, she said, but she does not think they .
should be penalized for their sexual habits.

She estimated that there were 200 to 300 people in
attendance at the conference. (This is very doubtful.) She
said they had shown a film on the evening of 10/24/70, but
she had not seen it. She understood it was newsreel type
footage. Some of the women also put on a theater presentation

7 on the subject of exploitation, intending to illustrate how
: the upbringing of children results in attitudes which cause
them to exploit each other. .

She said the discussions and meetings held on

Saturday impressed her as mainly bickering and yelling sessions
with all of the women trying to talk at once and the moderator

unable to maintain order. They put forth no clear-cut program,
arrived at no conclusions, and as of Sunday morning, appeared

to be no more cohesive than they had.been when they first arrived
at the camp. Mrs. SCHUYLER said she personally was not sure what
she wanted, and she thought many of the other women felt the same
way. She regarded the whole thing as an opportunity for a
pleasant weekend in the country among other females of more or
less common interests.

Agents took Mrs. SCHUYLER back to the farm, Seamed
additional Tieense numbers, and observed a number of women of
various ages who appeared to be just getting up.

Mrs. SCHUYLER said that each attendee had contributed
$1.00 and had brought some food. She thought the $1.00 might
have been to help pay some of the overhead and to pay kitchen
help which was provided to prepare the meals. She said Fellow-
ship Farm is owned by the Quakers and that they made the farm
available to groups who desired to ae means of bringing about
social improvements.

OMENS, LIBERATION MOVEMENT CONFERENCE
OWSHIP FARM, LIMERICK, PA.,
2 1970 nana

Women's Liberation Movement (WLM’ is made up of
loosely structured groups throughout the country, which
grouvs have been publicly described as advocating complete
equality for women. .

On October 21, 1970, a reliable source advised that
Betty Garman, WLM representative in Washington, D.C., had dis-
tributed a leaflet to selected WLM members to attend a special
meeting at a "Fellowshiv Farm" in Limerick, Pa., on October
23-25, 1970.

The leaflet stated the meeting was for people in-
terested in discussing the need for an active revolution
"because for an oppressive racist, sexist, society to really
change without revolution is impossible." The leaflet advised
those nlanning to attend to contact New York telephone number
212-799-1008 and furnished directions to the farm.

On October 22, 1970, a second reliable source advised
that a leaflet was distributed at Women's Center, 36 West 22nd
Street, New York City, concerning a meeting of revolutionary
women. The leaflet furnished directions to a "Fellowship Farm"
in Limerick, Pa. : i

tions nor conelusions of the FBI. It is

WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT CONFERENCE
HELD AT FELLOWSHIP FARM, LIMERICK, PA.,
ON_OCTOBER 23-25, 1970 a

a vhone call was made on October 22, 1979, to New York vhone
number 212-799-1008. The phone was answered by a woman who
identified herself as Lee. Lee stated that each attendee
should contribute $1.00 and should bring food and wine. She
stated two films would be shown, one on abortion, and the
other on an actual sex act being verformed. A guerrilla
theater called "Burning City" was also being planned.

a Me On October 25, 1970, a fourth reliable source was
in the area of Fellowship Farm during the early morning hours
b and spoke with a white female, age about 55, who identified :
qi herself as Phyllis\Schuyler from New York City. This woman ,;.” -
[i- told source that members of Women's Liberation had gathered .
at the farm for a weekend of discussions. She talked in-
cessantly about women's rights; exploitation; unfair salary
schedules; the need for better, cheaver medicine for all:
the evils of the military industrial comnlex which contributes
i to the exploitation of women: the necessity for ending the
stigma attached to homosexuals of both sexes: and the need
to erase social pressures against illegitimate children. She
advised there were a number of lesbians at the farm who had
put uv posters “Lesbians Unite" and that the lesbians shared
quarters somewhat separated from the other women.
?

- Mrs. Schuyler estimated that there were 200 to 300
people in attendance at the conference. She stated that a
film had been shown on the evening of October 24, 1970, but
that she had not seen it. Some of the women also put on a
theater presentation on the subject of exploitation, intend-
ing to illustrate how the uvbringing of children results in
attitudes which cause them to exploit each other.

She said the discussions and meetings held on Saturday
impressed her as mainly bickering and yelling sessions with all
of the women trying to talk at once and the moderator unable
to maintain order. They nut forth a no clear-cut program;
arrived at no conclusions; and, as of Sunday morning, anpeared
to be no more cohesive than they had been when they first
arrived. Mrs. Schuyler said she nersonally was not sure what
she wanted, and she thought many of the other women felt the
same way. She regarded the whole thing as an onportunity for
a pleasant weekend in the country among other females of more
or less common interests.

FROM : Legal,Counse

The Bureau has been receiving numerous requests from
the House and Senate Select Committees.
the number of requests being received, on September. 3, 1975,’ ,
we received four requests from the House Committee alone.
Many of the requests involve complex research and review of i.
We have recently experienced continu- x
ing pressure by both Committees to comply with their requests
Additionally, we have received in-
dividual telephonic requests from Staff personnel of the
Committees to expedite one particular request ahead of another;
and in many instances, the request for. expeditious handling of
a particular item conflicts with the request of some other Staff

Bureau materials, etc.

as quickly as possible.

SA Daly of this Division brought this matter to the
attention of Michael E. Shaheen, Jx., Special Counsel for In-
telligence Coordination in the Department,
he understood the problems being generated by the wolumes 0;
requests being received by the FBI.

The current guidelines with the Senate Select Com-

has reached the point with regard to the Senate Select Com-
mittee that it is not possible to comply with their requests
within the stated deadlines.
to abide by the guidelines adopted by the Department and the

RE: HOUSTUDY

Shaheen subsequently advised SA Daly that he had‘
brought this matter to the attention of the Senate Select
Committee orally in a conversation with Mark Gitenstein on
9/4/75 including the problems being encountered with in-
dividual Staff Members declaring that their particular
request had a higher priority than any other particular
request. Gitenstein told Shaheen that he would attempt to
correct this problem.

In a subsequent conversation with Staff Member Mark
Gitenstein, Gitenstein stated he had been informed by the
Department of the problem the Bureau is encountering in
responding within the deadlines set for various Committee
requests. He indicated that he would take steps to make
sure individual Staff Members do not on their own initiative
attempt to place their request ahead of any other particular
request without coordinating it with him. Additionally, he
stated it was his intention to bring this to the attention of
John El1liff, Task Force Director of the Domestic Task Force of
the Senate Select Committee, and suggest a meeting be held with
Bureau representatives on Monday, 9/8/75, in an effort to solve
this particular problem. If a meeting is held on that date, it
is expected that ‘a representative of the Intelligence Division,
Legal Counsel Division and the Department will be in attendance.

On April 24, 1975;~Director Kelley résponded toovf reques pli
regarding the Bureau's legal authority to-cordtict domestic intelli- ~_o
gence operations by providing material concerning the collection, Ww:
maintenance, dissemination, and destruction of information resulting \
from such investigations.

We have reviewed that portion of the Bureau's response relating \
to its authority to conduct domestic intelligence investigations and
believe that some clarification of matters therein is necessary for
us to better understand the Bureau's position. Accordingly, we would
appreciate a written response to the enclosed questions which relate
to the papers prepared by you and Messrs. Watters and Lacey; a portion
of the Domestic Intelligence Division position paper, "Investigations
of Subversion," May 19, 1972; and portions of Sections 87 and 122 of
the FBI Manual. To facilitate analysis, we would appreciate if the
Bureau could use the same format as the questions with any questions
not requiring an answer because of a prior response being so noted.

Should you or your staff desire to discuss these questions for
any reason, we would be glad to do so. If any clarification is needed,
please call Alan ©. Goldberg on 386-3575. Thank you for your cooperation.

advised by Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for

* advised Mr. Cutler that pursuant to the above arrangonment the

Attorney General was furnishing notification that no sooner than
ten days from such dato an appropriate official of the FBI may
renove from the sealed files momoranda requested by the Senate
Belect Committee on Intelligences Operations. :

A xeview of the sealed portions of the Joseph Kraft

to reveal any written or oral authorization or re~authorization
by tha Attorney General and/or the Director of the FBI for
electronic surveillance of Josoph Kraft as requested in ro-
forenced SSC letter dated May 14, 1975,

Enclosed with this memorandum for your information is

Lloyd il. Cutlcr, referred to above,

Enclosure

1 = the Attorney General

NOTE: SEBRET
The subject of above SSC inquiry, Joseph Kraft,

is the well-known newspaper columnist. A review of the

Kraft file reveals that the French security service, the

DST, conducted a microphone surveillance on Kraft's hotel

room for approximately one week during a 1969 visit by

Kraft to Paris. Such coverage was effected through the

urging of W. C. Sullivan former Assistant to the Director

who travelled to France at such time apparently at the

direction of deceased FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Details -<

of the above coverage have appeared in the media apparently

as a result of leaks within the administration of former

President Nixon. Kraft himself testified in detail 5/10/74,

regarding this matter before the United State Senate Subcom-

mittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, the Subcom-

mittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judi-

ciary, and the Subcommittee on Surveillance of the Committee

on Foreign Relations. ‘Pursuant to an agreement between

Kraft and the Attorney General certain documents, recordings

and other records which descrijbe the contents of the over-
hears from the electronic surveillance were sealed. The
above memorandum to the SSC reflects review of such sealed
documents for requested information as per authorization
from Attorney General contained in the enclosure to such
memorandum. This note has been Classified "Secret" in
order to protect the confidentiality of our relationship
with the French security service the disclosure of which
could reasonably be expected to result in serious damage
to national security. Classified by 6283, pgs 1, Indefinite.

ADMINISTRATIVE CONT'D

The demonstration on 7/15/70, was observed by SAS
ALBERT E, FALLER and J, ROBERT NEWTON.

With regard to future planned activity by Women's
Liberation Movement (WLM), included in this report, a separate
case file has been opened for this activity captioned "AUGUST 26
WOMEN'S STRIKE FOR EQUALITY" (NY 100-170260). The August 26 strike
will be worked under the new case and reported accordingly.

Characterizations of individuals and organizations
mentioned in this report have been set forth where they are
available.

This report is being classified “"eonfidentiel" because
the disclosure of information from informants of continuing value
(NY T-1 through NY T-22) could reveal the identity thereof and
could be injurious to the national security of the US.

Because of the extensive information furnished by
if WReeMA TH regarding WIM organization and activities, two T
- symbols (NY T-1 and NY T-3) are being used to further conceal
the identity of this informant.

In view of. the fact that. INFORMANT AND INFoemAaticn
wnicn TEwos re 1OENTIFY sw PoR mA wT : advised that there
@re no eiveveu LULL1cers OL tne WLM, no active investigation of
those persons listed on the bank account declaration is being
instituted at this time. —

My Motivation in Resisting the Suggestions for Removal

It would be easy indeed for me to sit back and accept
Umy removal from the King case aspects of SENSTUDY-75. I have
not found my efforts in this matter to be necessarily a picnic
lo or Sunday fun-outing. Rather, I have experienced mental strain
and fatigue from this work but, nonetheless, have always tried,
to the best of my ability, to do what I have felt is in the
Bureau's best interests. I do not think my removal is in thd)
Bureau's best interests and being the most knowledgeable pers
in the Bureau on this matter I feel compelled to present m
views in aS candid a way as I can for the benefit of the Directord
and other Bureau officials in their consideration of this matter.3

UNREC!

Though it is unfortunate, in a way, that the issue
involves me personally, I believe that the issue should be viewed
in a much larger sense because it may involve a confrontation
between the Bureau and the SSC. The entire investigation by the
SSC of the FBI has developed into an adversary proceeding which
it was undoubtedly destined to be. The SSC has continuously
dictated its demands, its procedures, etc., tous. We have had
only minimal support from the Department and have, in most
nstances, had to subjugate oungetves to 7 SSC. et 3F pow 31

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall Oh Se -NTVAL
RE: SENSTUDY-75 bet LUI Al
about the only real issue on which we have shown unbending
resistance has been that concerning the revelation of the
identities of our confidential informants--and that issue
is still in dispute.

Now comes another issue which on its surface may
appear small bit which I consider a major one. And this issue
concerns me personally and is difficult for me to be 100 per
cent objective about, try as I might. On every review of this
matter I still come up with the same conclusion. We must not
let ourselves be dictated to in how and with what personnel we
intend to defend ourselves. (And let us not kid ourselves.
When I say "defend," I mean that we are playing this "game"
with our defensive unit). To sum it up, it is as though the
opposition not only wants to make the rules of the game, but
also insists on dictating who and who not we can use in the
game. It is that simple.

What Is the SSC's Motivation Which Has Created This Issue?

Obviously, I cannot answer this question with any
degree of certainty. But I can make a studied guess. I have

been the Bureau's consultant on th yuterviews by the SSC, most
of them by SSC Staff Member Mich: i, in the King case {)y
There have been instances When, affex consulting with me, an -——

Agent or former Agent would be counseled by me to not answer a
particular question. I have done this generally for two main
reasons. First and foremost, it_has been vitally necessary for
me to protect the identities of{most im nt and valued
informants relating to the SOLO Operatio: aa more will be (4
said about this later in this memorandum. Secondly, there have
been many instances where the interview has gone well outside
agreed upon parameters necessitating my advice in some
instances for personnel to not answer certain questions. This
was the correct and only course of action I could take. It

has obviously rankled the SSC (actually, probably just Epstein).
I believe that this is evident from the 34-page LHM which I
recently prepared on Epstein interview of me and which I have been
told the consensus is that it clearly indicated my considerable
cooperation with the SSC but that at the same time I was not
permitting myself to be dominated. If Epstein believes me-a
hindrance to his work, it is logical to believe he would desire
my removal. I might add at this point that there have been a
number of instances where the consultation with me by personnel

CONGIENTIAL

has resulted in my directing that answers be given. As a
matter of fact, I am sure that I quctten directed answers
to be given tha? to not be given. (J 5

When the issue (involving my removal) first arose
about two weeks ago, I was given to understand that Epstein,
as a result of interviewing me, might believe that I had a
direct involvement in the King composite tape which was
prepared in the Laboratory and mailed to the King family and
that there, therefore, appeared to be a "conflict in interest"
on my part if I continued to handle the King case aspects for
SENSTUDY-75. As I full well know, and as I believe my
superiors are also convinced, I have been honest and forthright
on this issue. I was not directly involved in the composite
tape preparation or mailing and thus there is no "conflict of
interest."

The Shaheen Letter of 8/20/75

_ I do not believe that Shaheen's letter and its relay
of the Deputy Attorney General's (DAG) suggestion as to my
removal is altogether timely under the circumstances. First,
Shaheen is aware that I was interviewed on the King case and
that he would receive the results thereof, as he has of all King
interviews we know details about. Shouldn't Shaheen and indeed
the DAG have first had the benefit of the results of the interview
of me? (Shaheen now has it as my 34-page LHM was delivered to
him 8/20/75). Secondly, wouldn't it have been far more
appropriate for the Department to have at least first asked for
our views before making the suggestion as to my removal?

The DAG refers to Church's letter as having "some
merit." I find "some merit" unconvincing. It seems to me that
for the action being asked for by the DAG's suggestion there
should be a showing by Church of considerable or substantial
merit, not just "some." To me, "some" could apply to merit which
is minuscle in proportion. 7

Arguments Persuasive of My Not Being Removed

I am concerned of the precedent that might be set by my
removal. Just as I have by chance become the Bureau's "expert"
on the King case and also had supervised that case, we have two
other similar situations in the hopper at the moment. Supervisor

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall cor
RE: SENSTUDY-75
62-116395

James Lee has been considerably involved in handling our responses
to the SSC concerning mail opening operations and he personally
supervised matters relating to this down through the years.
Supervisor David Ryan has been immersed in preparing material and
coordinating the preparation of material relating to COINTELPRO.
He likewise was the principal overall Bureau supervisor relating
to COINTELPRO down through the years. Significantly, both of
these areas, like the King case, have been designated as abuse
areas by the SSC. Remove Phillips today from the King case and
we might be asked to remove Lee and Ryan tomorrow from their
participating in the SENSTUDY-75 project. Surely we cannot
permit the loss of these men in these important areas.

In his letter, Church refers to my "personal interest."
I have no personal interest as I am not guilty of any illegality,
impropriety, abuse or whatever. My only interest in the King
case has and remains an official one and I am prepared to defend
anything and everything I did officially in that case.

There is no showing in either of the communications
attached that the FBI's (and, thusly, also the Department's)
interests will be adversely affected by my continued assignment
in this matter. Conversely, there are strong arguments available
to show that my being removed could_well work to the detriment of
the FBI/Department. {I refer now toJour SOLO operation and the
overriding necessity for protectin, he informants engaged therei
There has already been one clear cut important example where I
believe it is likely that I prevented information from being
acquired by the SSC which could well have been damaging to us
and the informants. This concerned the testimony in an Executive
Session of former SA Robert Nichols. I accompanied him to that
Session although not present. My questioning of him in advance
of his testimony revealed that he had, or at least believed he had,
certain information which, if given to the SSC, about one Stanley
Levison, could well have been most damaging to us. (Levison was
the secret Communist Party member who was King's principal
advisor). When questioning of Nichols turned to Levison's back-
ground, Nichols resisted questioning and eventually told Epstein
that he was proceeding on advice of me. I felt that it was
imperative to have given him that advice and the record of the
Nichols testimony and factors relating thereto are clear on this.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall a
RE: SENSTUDY-75
62-116395

Immodestly I must be candid to let you know that there
is not likely another individual presently on the rolls of the
Bureau who would have the background and knowledge of all aspects
of the King and related matters to be able to handle the important
consultation phase of the SENSTUDY-75 project relating to the
King matter.

Additional Observations Which Should Be Considered in Any Overall
Judgment On This Matter

In his letter, Shaheen refers to "for the sake of
appearances." To me this is far too general and imprecise to
be used aS an argument of merit. Just exactly who does he
have in mind in respect to "appearances?" Appearances to what?

Senator Church is equally imprecise in his reference to
"standpoint of appearances." Appearances to whom? He refers to
"some may conclude" that there is a conflict between my personal
interest and the interests of the FBI and the Department of
Justice. Exactly who are the "some" he refers to?

It appears to be an irony indeed that Church can very
indirectly and obliquely suggest possible improprieties on my
part, improprieties in the eyes of unspecified persons, without
the Senator citing even a single specific example or incident
and his obvious lack of ability to do so after the exposure by
the SSC to considerable involvement on my part. I say it is
ironical because at the same time that there is an objique
suggestion as to an impropriety on my part, the SSC staff, which
is looking into abuses, has been guilty. There are a number of
improprieties which I am prepared to document. Some examples are
illustrated.

After my first consultation experience which occurred
in Atlanta, Georgia, when SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel
interviewed retired SA Alan G. Sentinella, I wrote a memorandum
from W. O. Cregar to you (Mr. Wannall) dated 5/13/75. I pointed
out two instances related to this interview which were very
suggestive of a lack of objectivity on the part of Seidel. One
concerned Seidel's comment that the FBI was not letting Sentinella
give him "good information." I pointed out that to begin with
this was an unjustified allegation and Seidel was set straight
immediately after his remark. Actually, the mere fact that Seidel
was referring to "good" information suggested that certain
information fits SSC's desires and others does not. There appeared
to be a lack of regard for merely securing the facts regardless of
what those facts might indicate. Another indicator of lack of

objectivity was $ raLanciay about "illegal use of taps."

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY-75
62-116395

Our files are replete with instances where Epstein, in
questioning present and former SAs, has gone outside the parameters
agreed upon for interviews.

There have been instances where interviews were
conducted with former SAs without giving us agreed advance
notice. Noteworthy, recently one pertained to former
Laboratory Section Chief Richard Millen and John ELLiff of
the SSC, when it was brought to his attention, agreed that
we should have had advance notice and apologized. Another
concerned an interview @former Assistant Director Charles Brennan.

I find the bulk of Church's letter is comprised of
weasel-worded innuendos. He uses such terms as "may be
a cause of concern"; "possible problem"; “presumably, compiling
materials." The latter reference is to a presumption that I am
compiling materials for the SSC on the King case. It seems to
me that the Senator should either know or not know the fact, and
if he does not know, he should not presume anything. To set the
record straight, I have not been compiling materials. The
assignments have been made to other personnel. I have, however,
assisted the other personnel in locating materials and in
coordinating replies. And, of course, I do review the replies
prior to their transmittal. As a matter of fact, if the SSC's
insistence that I be removed were to come to pass, I believe
that it would end up having actually suffered to a degree in
securing information from us. Our retrieval system is not the
best for the purposes we have encountered and my participation
in the retrieval of much of the material involved has placed me
in a position to locate or assist in locating material which
might well otherwise never be located for the SSC.

It seems strange indeéd that in these days of such
concern by Congress for the rights and privacy of individuals,
there seems to be no addressing my privacy or rights in this matter.

I find it also strange that the Senator never once
mentioned my name in his letter. He, or whoever prepared the
letter, certainly knew my name. I would like to know why the
Senator chose not to mention ny name.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall tea
RE: SENSTUDY-75 .
62-116395 OY

Again referring to when this matter first surfaced
about two weeks ago, the initial advice to me of it was by you,
Mr. Wannall, who had obtained your information orally from
Messrs. Shaheen and Blackhurst of the Department, who had
apparently received their information orally from the SSC. I
explained my position and I received from you your confidence
in me. One aspect related to the fact that the SSC "compkaint"
was far too general and that if the SSC had something to say it
ought to be in writing and specific. I appreciated and so stated
to you this confidence in my integrity in this entire matter.
You next told me that you had discussed this matter with
Associate Director Callahan who shared your views both as to my
integrity and as to the issue relating to obtaining specifics,
not generalities, and in writing. It heartened me. Finally,
you passed to me the fact that Mr. Callahan had discussed the
matter with the Director and the general reaction was that the
SSC would first have to "put up or shut up" before any action
would be taken as to my removal. This was likewise most
heartening to me. .

I see nothing in either the Church or Shaheen letters
that indicates the SSC has "put up." As far as I am concerned
the SSC has dealt with generalities and has produced nothing
of substance. [I trust that our position today would be.the same
as it was initially, “put up or shut up." -

Not surprising is Church's verbiage, such as serving
"the interests of the country" and "assure the American people,"
To me, this may sound alright as a speech on the floor of the
Senate or a political speech. It is very unconvincing to me in
the context of the issue involved.

Summarizing and concluding as to the Church letter, I
am reminded of the often told story about the Texan, a man of
considerable proportion, some 6'6'' in height and weighing about
250 pounds. As the story goes, when all the BS is squeezed out
of him there remains a mere midget. That's how I feel about the
Church letter. (I would not mention this closing item were
Jim Adams in town and this memorandum would have to pass through

him. Sorry Jim!).

Iam writing to call your attention to a mat-
ter which may be a cause of concern to you and to the
Select Committee at some time in the future.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

As bis may know,

a special unit has been estab-
D

Committee's Seoueste “for materials and to handle certain
arrangements for the Committee staff's interviews. The
Special Agents assigned to this unit accompany Bureau
witnesses to the Committee offices, travel to out-of-town
locations where Committee staff interviews are conducted,
. and apparently “de-brief" interview il after the
interviews.

One possible problem has arisen with this arrange-
ment. As you are aware, one of the alleged abuses which
the Committee is examining pursuant to S. Res. 21 involves
the FBI's activities with respect to the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. As the inquiry has proceeded, informa-
tion has been developed to indicate that one of the

“Special Agents who has been handling Committee staff inter-
views, “de-briefing" witnesses, and, presumably, compiling
materials with respect to the King matter was also. the
supervisory case agent during the time that some of the
alleged FBI improprieties regarding Dr. King took place.
Moreover, asa logical step in our investigation, it was

recently necessary to interview this Special Agent to
determine the nature and extent of his involvement in and
knowledge of the alleged abuses at the time when he served
as supervisory case agent with respect to the King case.
During the interview he did provide detailed information
concerning his substantial participation in this matter.

The Committee in no way intends at this juncture
to pre-judge the propriety of the FBI's activities with
respect to Dr. King, and it would be inappropriate to 7
characterize the conduct of any of the Bureau's personnel
regarding this case until all-the facts are in. Neverthe-
less, I am concerned that in this kind of situation, the
interests of the FEI and the Department of Justice might
best be served, from the standpoint of appearances, by re-
cunsidering the assignment of this Opccicl Agent te the
King matters. It is possible that. some may conclude that .
there is a conflict between the Special Agent's personal
interest, and the interests of the FBI and the Justice
Department in ensuring that full disclosure to. the ‘Commit
tee is made with respect to this case. 7

Finally, let me assure you that the Committee
has no evidence that the present arrangement has prevented
the Committee from obtaining the full disclosures sought;
but it seems to me that it would be mutually beneficial
for appropriate steps to be taken so that we will both be
able to assure the American people and the Congress that.
our oversight responsibilities were aaa in an objec-
tive and impartial way.

: Ir hope you will share my view that this course
will best serve our respective interests and, of course,
. the interests of the country. : ‘

HEREIN | ‘ap Spa #0] SSC STAFF MEMBERS
pate4
accu ;
0 On, the evening of August 11, 1975, Mr. Lester Seidel

and Mr. Log# Johnson, Staff Members of the Senate Select
Committee, met with Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

of the San Francisco Office. This meeting occurred over dinner.
No statements were made by either of these individuals as to
any rights that SAC Bates might have in connection with the
interview.

During the dinner, Mr. Seidel referred to COINTELPRO
involving the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party
in San Francisco. Bates advised him that he was in charge of
the San Francisco Office from July, 1967 until the end of
April, 1970, when he was transferred to Chicago. Bates stated
that he was aware of the investigation being conducted on the
Black Panther Party but was not personally conversant with
all the details of this investigation as such details were
all contained in the FBI's file. On at least two occasions
Mr. Seidel referred to specific facts occurring in other parts
of the country involving anonymous letters sent to individuals
under COINTELPRO. He asked if Bates agreed that these actions
were proper. Mr. Seidel was told that Bates had no way of
knowing the facts as he related were true or any other of
the circumstances involved and that, therefore, he was unable
to comment at all.

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates had any recommendations
for legislati6én which the Committee could propose that would
assist the FBI in the domestic counterintelligence field.
Bates informed him that he was not fully conversant with this
entire field and that it was thef%erogative of FBI officials
-at Washington and Department of Justice officials to recommend
such legislation.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your
agency; it and its contents are not to be a a outside

INTERVIEW OF SAC
CHARLES W. BATES

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Seidel also inquired as to whether Bates felt
that an extension of electronic surveillances into the domestic
intelligence field would be of assistance. Bates informed
him that the FBI was operating according to current court
decisions as involve electronic surveillances and that the
courts had recently precluded this action in strictly domestic
intelligence matters. Mr. Seidel was informed that this was
a decision for FBI officials in Washington.

On several occasions during the evening, Mr. Johnson
asked Bates if he was aware of the "Houston Plan." On each
occasion Bates informed him that he was not aware of the
“Houston Plan" and his only knowledge of it is what he has
seen in the public press. At one time Mr. Johnson asked if
Bates thought that Mr. Hoover had turned down the "Houston
Plan" because he was afraid for his job. Bates again replied
that he had no firsthand knowledge having anything to do with
the "Houston Plan" but he was certainly aware that Mr. Hoover
was not afraid of anything or anyone.

Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt
that the use of “black bag jobs" would be of advantage in
conducting domestic counterintelligence operations. Bates
replied that he had no personal direct knowledge of such matters
and had never been involved in such matters.

OvERSiGHT

During the eve: g/ Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt
that a congressional committee of the FBI was sound);
and proper. Bates informed ‘tha Ee certainly agreed with the
concept of congressional -over: as long as it was constructive |
and not destructive. Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt that the
FBI's security operation should be completely divorced from
its criminal responsibilities and handled as a separate agency
or a separate part of the FBI. Bates informed him that it
appeared that the FBI's efforts in both the criminal and the
security field had been effective and appeared to be proper
in its present context. Mr. Seidel inquired if Bates was
personally acquainted with Mr. William C. Sullivan, former
FBI official. Mr. Seidel was informed that Bates worked in
the same division with Mr. Sullivan in the 1950's and knew
him as another supervisor at FBI Headquarters. ,

agreements that Mr. Sullivan had had with Mr. Hoover and he

Seidel then asked if Bates was aware of the dis-

had anything to do with a drinking problem. Bates said again
ehat-fie Was not aware of the Specifics.”

On the afternoon of August 13, 1975, Mr. LES gonnson
came into the San Francisco FBI Office saying he had just a
few more questions he wanted to ask Bates. He then asked if
the San Francisco Office was involved in foreigi"counter-
intelligence work, and he was informed that we were as were
many other FBI offices. He then asked if we surveilled every-
one who went into or came out of the Soviet Consulate in San
Francisco. He was informed that Bates did not intend to dis-
cuss with him any investigative techniques or anything having
to do with pending investigations. Mr. Johnson said he was
attempting to find some individual who was an expert in foreign
counterintelligence, particularly the Soviet threat to the
United States. Bates informed him that there were probably
a number of people in the United States who would qualify in
this category but Bates did not consider himself as an expert
in this field.

The above represents specific matters brought up
during these discussions.

FBI Headquarters making four inquiries on August 6, 1975;
on the same date, the following answers were LeCeyeaT—

Xs it permissible for agent to give general
answers concerning the Black Panther Party (BPP) as to
membership number and Chapter numbers at various dates?

Answer: Yes.

Local media has previously set forth a memorandum
purportedly from the FBI, San Francisco Office, suggesting
consideration should be given to furnishing fabricated
documents originating with the Oakland Police Department
and the FBI, San Francisco, when, in fact, the memorandum

may agent point out that this document originated with the
Bureau rather than San Francisco?

Answer: Yes.

false correspondence directed to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and others
abroad, can agent refer SSC Staff to Bureau when questioned
concerning identity of agents. preparing correspondence?

"U.S, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

“INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

Is it necessary for agent to express an opinion
as to morality, legality of said Counterintelligence
Program (COINTEL) ? E

Answer: You are not obliged to answer those
questions you, do not desire to answer, but if you wish you
may comment on the legality or morality of the plan.

SA DENNIS MILLER related that he desired that it -
be borne in mind that the por eeu in no way wished to. impede
the SSC investigation.

: LESTER B. SEIDEL, SSC Staff Member, appeared at the
San Francisco Office of the FBI on August 11, 1975, and
interviewed ‘SA LEO BRENNEISEN from 1:03 PM to 2:30 PM.
SEIDEL prefaced the interview by explaining that he’ had
been advised that BRENNEISEN was the Coordinator for the
COINTEL in’San Francisco from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1970.
It was pointed out to him that the case was assigned to
agent from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1971.

SBIDEL asked if agent had, in fact, approved all
proposals coming from the San Francisco Office. He was
advised that not necessarily because if another agent made
a proposal the person approving it in San Francisco would
be the person signing the outgoing mail, namely, the Supervisor
or Relief Supervisor.

SEIDEL asked what Squad agent had been assigned
to during this Program, and he was advised S-6. He inquired
iff there was any COINTEL in San Francisco against US; he
was advised to the contrary. He inquired as to the usual
number of cases assigned agent, and was advised that to
agent's best recollection probably 30 at any one time. He
asked if agent's work was exclusively security during the
handling of the COINTEL Program and he was advised agent
did have some criminal assignments. He inquired if there
Was any relationship between COINTEL and criminal assignments,
and he was advised no and that agent desired to limit the
scope of his questioning to the COINTEL Program.

SEIDEL then asked how many suggestions the agent
had submitted in COINTEL. . He was advised that an estimate
would be difficult but probably the nearest figure would be
some two suggestions a month-with possibly six months in
two years when no suggestions were made. He inquired as
to agent's knowledge of what percentage of total proposals
from all scurces submitted to the Bureau had been approveé,
and he was advised only a small percentage.

,U.S.-SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

At this point, SEIDEL requested agent to outline the

types of COINTEL proposals submitted by San Francisco. He

was answered that anonymous letters, letters with pseudonyms,
and letters signed with the name of an existing person had
been used. 7 ia

It was pointed out that the program had included
the use of anonymous letters, including those directed to
landlords advising that the Black Panther Party was occupying
their property; letters to people supporting BEE programs,

‘ including the Breakfast Program and enclosing copies of the

BPP color book for children encouraging the shooting of
police officers and/or articles from the "Black Panther
Party", the official BPP newspaper, showing their propensity
and advocacy of violence; letters to organizations containing
articles that showed the BPP in direct opposition to their
aims, such as a letter to a Jewish organization showing BPP
support of Palestine guerrillas.

It was pointed out that letters had been directed
to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER in Algeria in the names of BPP members.
At this point, SEIDEL interrupted to explain that he was
enlisting the complete cooperation of the interviewee, that
there had been some Congressional criticism of the COINTEL,
that there were some segments of the population that were
anti-FBI and that he desired to present the FBI in a proper

light, and that he had good friends in the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked, was it necessary to have utilized
COINTEL. Agent advised that it was difficult to correctly |
judge the effect of the program but it was felt it was not
without some effect because the Black Panther Party had not
only dwindled from a membership of approximately 1,000 in
1969 to perhaps 200 in 1973, but that the organization became
split with dissension and had dropped much of its former
advocacy for violence.

SEIDEL then requested that the agent give his
recommendation on what COINTEL in the future should be;
whether there should be a division between security and
criminal investigations to different agencies in order that —
a possible intrusion on the rights of an individual in
intelligence matters might not necessarily preclude his
being prosecuted by the Bureau in a criminal matter. Agent

DocId:32989641 Page 122



‘U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

refused to furnish his “off-thecuff" opinion, pointing
out that he felt that it was without the scope of his
release. :

Without further questioning agent concerning the
types of COINTEL proposals, SEIDEL next asked if the
Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) on the BPP was in operation
at the time COINTEL was initiated, and what proposals were
submitted in COINTEL based on information from ELSUR.

SEIDEL was advised agent's release would not allow
him*to discuss ELSUR.

SEES EEE SEIDEL asked if- the San Francisco Division had made
any "snitch" proposals. When asked to clarify, the question,
he stated that this was a suggestion to the effect that a
Black Panther Party member be accused of being an FBI
informant. Agent replied that to the best of his recollection
no such recommendations had been made to the Bureau by San
Francisco, dnd on the contrary, agent knew that it had been
pointed out by San Francisco that any such allegation. should
be most carefully considered inasmuch as BPP history has
indicated that they had dealt severely with suspected infor-
Mants, even to the point of killing them.

SEIDEL then asked if the San Francisco Division
had received a great deal of "flak" from the Bureau on this
program. He was advised that the Bureau operates a "tickler
system" for following investigations and that the program
had received some priority from the FBI but agent had never
considered correspondence from the Bureau as being "flak".

SEIDEL at this point instead of questioning made
the statement that the Bureau gave this matter “high priority".
No comment was made to this statement.

SEIDEL next questioned agent if he had read any
| publicity concerning a May 11, 1970 letter from the Bureau
to San Francisco entitled, "Special Operations Research", in
which it was suggested that some consideration be given to
furnishing the BPP spurious documents that supposedly
originated with the Oakland Police Department and the FBI.
He explained that some newspaper had received a copy of the
document under the Freedom of Information Act and thereafter
published it. He inquired if a response to the letter

_ NW 55160

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

had been made by San Francisco. Agent advised that it was

his recollection that San Francisco had responded recommending
against both proposals, pointing out that the BEP had in the
short past published contingency plans of the Berkeley Police
Department for a raid on National Headquarters to the
embarrassment of that agency. San Francisco was of the
opinion that if spurious documents were furnished to the

BPP they would immediately publish them, rather than attempt
to develop an informant and the operation presented a great

. deal of possible embarrassment and publicity for the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked for agent's knowledge of why the letter
had been captioned as previously described rather than
Counterintelligence Program, Black Panther Party. Agent
stated he had no recollection of exact caption of the letter.
SEIDEL then went on to explain that he had been advised that
the Bureau had several COINTELS and the one covering Special

Operations Research was a COINTEL covering foreign operations.
Agent made no comment.

SEIDEL requested what proposais had been made to
disrupt the BPP newspaper; how did the proposals originate,
and what offices submitted them. He was advised that it was
agent's recollection that the Bureau may have requested
suggestions from several offices but that to agent's knowledge
none had been approved. When SEIDEL continued to question the
agent concerning specific proposals and why their approval
was not recommended by San Francisco, he was advised that one
proposal was the use of a foul-smelling chemical to put on
the paper. San Francisco was of the opinion it would not
be practical inasmuch as it would contaminate an airplane
and would subject the airline or the printing company to
damages. SEIDEL was further advised that it was believed
the suggestion may have been made for the changing of a first |
page of an issue at the printing company to embarrass the BPP,
but it was pointed out that this would also merely result in

- a claim being filed against the printer.

SEIDEL was advised that there may have been a
suggestion that some thought should be given to the possible
delay of the plates for the paper, that suggestion coming
at the time when the paper was being printed in New York
with the master copy being filmed in San Francisco. San
Francisco did not suggest apptoval because a mere delay would
have been of little benefit because the paper was not timely.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

a INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

SEIDEL asked about the disruption of the BPP
Breakfast Program. The answer was given that agent had
no recollection of this, and SEIDEL was asked did he have
any information from the Bureau that we had attempted a
disruption of the program in San Francisco. He related
that he believed not and that it probably happened in :
San Diego. ; >

SEIDEL asked about a suggestion that informants
set up a possible confrontation between the BPP and the
Republic of New Africa (RNA). Agent stated he had no
recollection of such a proposal and did not believe it had
been submitted by San Francisco because the membership and
activity in RNA had been minimal in this area.

SEIDEL then asked if we had suggested that landlords
in the San Francisco area be encouraged to insist on their
xent from the BPP. Agent advised he had no recollection
of this, but could see nothing wrong in it.

, SEIDEL inquired as to the amount of knowledge:
that SAC CHARLES BATES would have had concerning COINTEL.
He was advised that agent had no information, that he, himself,
had never discussed the program with Mr. BATES while it was

in operation, ..SEIDEL then inquired if former SAC HARRY
MORGAN had’ been ill during the time “He"was™ was~assignédad to San \

Francitsco—and—the~réeason—for-his transfer. Agent replied ~~
,hée“haa-no~in formatton~concerning—this—mat ——

ee reer aerees Web cane if he felt that anyof the actions

agent described as being taken by the San Francisco Division
were illegal. SEIDEL stated that he did not’ believe that
these were matters that were in violation of any existing
criminal statutes, but there might be some question as to
whether the FBI had the specific authority to do these things.

SEIDEL ended the interview by again reiterating
that he was a friend of the Bureau, that he was making an
- inquiry and desired to obtain the opinions of both Headquarters
and agents in the field, and that he may make a request to the
Bureau to widen the scope of agent's release.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALB CLAR’

by SSC_STAFF MEMBER

On August 13, 1975, former Special Agent Albert P.
Clark, who was a supervisor in the San Francisco FBI Office
and who retired in December of 1969, advised as follows:

He was interviewed in his home at 66 Elm,
Larkspur, California, by SSC Member Lester B. Seidel from
5:40 P.M. to 6:55 P.M., August 12, 1975.
aie aa

Clark was not placed under oath and no mention
was made of his rights. However, Seidel was pleasant and
in no way antagonistic. The interview was general, not
penetrative, not in depth, and very few specific questions were
asked. There appeared to be no discernible criticism of
either the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) or the
Bureau's investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) by
Seidel.

’ r
Seidel was ‘compelled om more than one occasion
to declare that he was pro-FBI, that the object of his
inquiries was to assist the United States Senate in under-
standing the problem in order that they could consider
possible legislation that may eliminate any abuses in the

future.

Seidel did mention the fact several times that
information had been leaked to the press that oeKe Seberg,
the movie actress, had become pregnant by a BPP official.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK
SSC_STAFF MEMBER

Seidel finally asked Clark if he would have okayed
a COINTEL proposal like this and he answered that he would
have if he felt that it would have sufficiently hindered
the BPP, stating that possibly in some of these occasions
someone might get hurt but on the other hand, investigation
of the BPP by the FBI might be made easier and it might
also cut down on the number of BPP supporters.

Clark was asked to whom the main BPP case was
assigned and to whom COINTEL had been assigned in the San
Francisco Division. Clark replied that he did not remember
but possibly during the time of his supervision, more than
one Agent -had handled the matters.

Seidel asked how many BPP informants the San
Francisco Division had. Clark replied he did not recall
beoaure he did not believe that Seidel had a right to know.
A .
Seidel inquired about the BPP wiretap, asking
who had requested the tap, the Bureau or the” San Francisco
Division. Again, Clark replied that he did not recall but
the San Francisco Division would not have necessarily
waited for the Bureau to initiate the matter but might have
requested the Bureau rather than the Bureau having initiated
the matter.

Seidel wanted to have an example of a COINTEL
proposal. He was not given a specific example but general
conversation was had to the effect that any move that might
be suggested that would aid the San Francisco Division in
their investigation of the BPP in determining their
supporters and financiers and possibly disenchanting those
individuals might be an example.

Seidel did not ask Clark whether he had done a
particular thing.

Questioned concerning whether he felt COINTEL had
been effective, Clark replied he did not believe the matter
was susceptible to proof but the BPP had sure gone into a
steep decline.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK
SSC_STAFF MEMBER

Seidel again brought up the Seberg matter and
asked if it had done any good. Clark stated he replied, 7
"Maybe."

During this conversation, Clark got the general
impression that perhaps Seidel did not feel that COINTEL
had been necessary but Clark had argued that it had made
the BPP more difficult to operate-and possibly easier
for the FBI to investigate.

Seidel then wanted to know what there was about
the BPP that caused such a concentration of FBI investi-
gative attention. Clark pointed out that this would have
to be answered in the context of time, that at the time the
program was initiated, there was no doubt that the BPP
was a violent, racist organization opposing all law enforce-
ment, attacking officers and generally disturbing the
tranquility of the community.

Seidel then went on to discuss the business of
pressure. Had Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates
and the Bureau put too much pressure on the matter? Clark
stated there was undoubtedly pressure because everyone
was interested in doing the best type job possible and
finding out everything possible concerning the BPP. There
was obvious pressure from the Bureau in the matter and the
Bureau, in a case like this, could never be satisfied.
Clark stated that he related that perhaps too much
pressure had come from the Bureau because he had felt at
the time he was a supervisor that San Francisco Division
knew more about thé BPP than the Bureau. On the other
hand, he related that Bureau officials were probably
under pressure because of the national interest and the
demands on them in Washington.

Seidel related that he was interested in ascer-
taining what Agent would make the best witness to appear
in Washington to explain and testify concerning COINTEL.
He specifically requested Clark's recommendation and mentioned
the names of Special Agents Leo S. Brenneisen of San
Francisco and Bob Baker of Los Angeles. Clark stated that
he had countered by suggesting that somebody in Washington
who directed the program and approved all proposals might
be a better witness.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK
SSC_STAFF MEMBER

Clark recalled that near the first of the inter-
view, Seidel probably, more to make conversation than to
obtain information, asked a few questions concerning US
and the Republic of North Africa (RNA). He was advised
that US had not been active in this division and there had
been no pertinent RNA activity brought to his attention.
Seidel asked if Ron Karenga of US had visited San Francisco
and Clark replied he had no exact recollection of this.

Seidel talked and asked Clark's opinion on the
separation into different agencies of the Bureau's criminal
and security investigations. Clark stated that he told
Seidel that in the past he had considered this and felt that
frankly it might have advantages, and at the same time,
might have disadvantages. He pointed out that the
disadvantages were that you could not be sure that it, in
fact, would work and that if you remove the security
investigations from the Bureau, you would undoubtedly
lose a great deal, including public support.

Seidel asked if Clark had worked under former
SAC Harry-Morgan. dvised that hé had retired prior to  _
€hé time Morgan was assigned to the San Francisco Division. _
Op newer :

Clark pointed out that during the interview, a
recorder appeared prominently on his desk, and Seidel
could, of course, not be sure that it was not in operation,
although as the duration of the interview lengthened, it
must have been obvious to Seidel that it was not operating.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER/SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET
By SSC_STAFF MEMBER saree serana Sane secaee

: On August'14, 1975, retired former Special Agent:
William A: CoKéndet was interviewed from. 9:30.A.M: to. * .°
11:15 A.M. by Lester B: Seidel, Investigator for, the U.S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activités” (SSC).
The interview took place at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness
Avenue, San Francisco. i 7

Mr. Seidel mentioned that he was serving as a
counsel for the SSC, investigating all phases of the United
States intelligence community, and he had chosen the Black
Panther Party and the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL)
as his field. He stated that he was hoping for full
cooperation on the part of the former Special Agent.

He was advised that former Special Agent Cohendet
was willing to cooperate with the committee and he trusted
that something constructive would come out of the effort
being put forward. Former Special Agent Cohendet also
pointed out that in his opinion the Black Panther Party (BPP)
had. been a group devoted to violence, thievery, and fraud,
and the committee should realize the type of Subjects with
whom they are dealing in order to place the investigation
in its proper framework.

The first question concerned the former Special
Agent's background and Bureau service. This was briefly
furnished.

Seidel then asked when and how the technical
surveillances had been installed, who initiated them, and
who approved them.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY
SSC_STAFF MEMBER

The former Special Agent replied that he was
not party to any of these arrangements and did not know
any of the details.

Seidel then asked if former Special Agent
Cohendet knew the origin and purposes of the COINTEL
Program. He was informed that the former Agent did not
know the origin of the program, and said he believed its
purposes were those as set forth in the instructions which
Seidel had and which spoke for themselves. The former
Agent admitted that said program at one time had been
assigned to him but due to the press of other functions,
he had been unable to give it a great deal of time and
felt that during the period that it had been assigned to
him, it had been largely ineffective.

Seidel then asked if there was any connection
between ELSUR and COINTEL and the reply was given that
obviously there would be if the ELSUR material being
reviewed could be considered as having any pertinence to
a COINTEL operation. However, former Special Agent Cohendet
could not recall having used this material while the case
was assigned to him, at least to any significant degree.
Not having the files available made it impossible to
state positively if there had been any specific instance of use
of this material.

Seidel asked as to the possible effectiveness of
anonymous letters and he was informed that in the opinion
of the former Agent, such letters, particularly having to
do with, personal infidelity or thievery, which were the
usual suggested avenues, would have little effect on the
recipients who were active in such fields themselves much
of the time. In the more serious areas of perhaps trying
to falsely show that an individual was an FBI or police
informant, the former Special Agent said that the use of
this technique would not be used for fear of causing bodily
harm or death to an innocent person due to the well-known
propensity of the BPP of dealing harshly with any suspected
deviator let alone informant.

SSC_STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked as to the value of ELSUR to
the BPP investigation and the former Special Agent stated
that in his belief it was extremely valuable in many ways.
For instance, it assisted and gauged the true Huey Newton,
his plans, and weaknesses. It was also valuable in esti-
mating the possible effect of a certain COINTEL program
as possibly suggested by some other office. As a result
of their information, the San Francisco Office usually
rejected most suggestions as being unlikely to be successful.

Seidel wondered if ELSUR was not the most
valuable, sirigle investigative aid that the Bureau had had
in, this investigation, and the former Special Agent agreed
that he was probably correct.

Seidel then wondered if the COINTEL proposals;
should be part of some legislation proposed by Congress
and the former Special Agent replied that the Bureau
officials, in his opinion, should be allowed to comment
on this because the fact that the program would be ineffective
against the BPP might not be a valid argument that it would
not work to better advantage in other circumstances.

Former Special Agent Cohendet declined to
comment on the effectiveness of COINTEL as used against
the Socialist Workers Party, not peyan had any experience
with its use in that field.

Seidel then asked about informants and asked if
there had been any pressure from the Bureau in the develdop-
ment of such sources. Former Special Agent Cohendet
acknowledged that there certainly had been great pressure
in this direction, as it was well known that informants were
a necessary part of any investigation and a police organi-
zation can never give up on this phase of its work no matter
how difficult the circumstances were in their development.
In the case of the BPP, the development of informants was
particularly difficult because of the fear that many persons
in the black community felt concerning the BPP as well as
the lack of desire to cooperate against another black
person.

Seidel asked about foreign funds being raised
and given to the BPP, and former Special Agent Cohendet
recalled that "Masai" Hewitt and others went to. Sweden
and other countries where the BPP raised money on speech
making tours.

Seidel then asked about any investigation of
BPP funds and former Special Agent Cohendet said that it
was his recollection that investigation of BPP funds had
been undertaken through legal channels but he had no
personal knowledge of the investigation and declined to
go further into this field.

: Seidel asked about referrals of Bureau information
to the Internal Revenue Service and former Special Agent
Cohendet said that he had no personal knowledge of what

had been done in this direction.

Seidel then asked about the affair between
Actress Jean Seberg and "Masai" Hewitt, which had appeared
in a Hollywood gossip column and had alleged that Seberg
had become pregnant by Hewitt. Seidel said that the Los
Angeles Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
admitted leaking this information to someone in the press.

Former Special Agent Cohendet knew that this
couple had been lovers for a brief period but denied any
knowledge of any leak to the press by either San Francisco
or Los Angeles.

Seidel asked if the former Agent thought that
leaking this type of information was appropriate. No
comment was offered as to this question.

Seidel, at the conclusion of the interview, said
that he had noted that the "faking" of police records as
suggested had never been undertaken and he observed that he
believed the COINTEL abuses were being overplayed by the
press. From what he learned in interviews in San Francisco,
it seemed to him that the program had been mostly played
down and indeed, an independent judgment had been exercised
in the implementation of the program.

A general discussion of the BPP ensued in which
former Special Agent Cohendet reiterated the criminal
background and threatening attitude of many of the BPP
members, their mendacious ways, and their lack of credi-
bility in their public statements. The former Special
Agent credited the news media with helping to build up
the BPP beyond its actual strength and influence.

Seidel asked about the former Agent's knowledge of

“In summation, Seidel ‘ventured the opinion that he
thought the ELSUR technique was far moré valuable in the
carrying out of the investigation of the BPP than the
COINTEL. Former Special Agent Cohendet had to agree

to the above observation.

Former Special Agent Cohendet was not advised
of any rights that he might have in declining to answer
any questions and Seidel said he was actually seeking
witriesses for a possible hearing in Washington, D.C. He
stated that no names would be mentioned in any write-up
he would make concerning his interviews.

wee yee INTERVIEW OF FORMER 6A DAVID E. TODD
ww BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 12, 1975, retired former SA David E. Todd
was interviewed from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. by Lester B. Seidel,
Investigator for the SSC. The interview took place at the
Holiday Inn, San Francisco.

By way of background, in’all contacts with Seidel
previously, former SA Todd has indicated to him great reluctance
to discuss these matters without clearance from the Bureau,
and pointed out to Seidel that the Bureau had released former
SA Todd from the Employment Secrecy Agreement for the purpose
of a staff interview, but Seidel was told that former SA Todd
did not think it was either his responsibility or his prerogative
to provide information or make information public; that while
employed he was acting as an Agent of the Federal Government
and felt it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to
provide the information, and that if the Senate Committee

7 desired information from former SA Todd, the questions should
have been submitted to him in writing, and his answers should
have been made in writing and first forwarded to the FBI, and
then after the FBI determined it advisable to make these answers
available to the Committee, that would have been the proper
channel.

Seidel pointed out the Committee and the Bureau had
made an agreement whereby the Bureau would make Agents available
to the Committee for interview. Former SA Todd pointed out to
Seidel that he is not in the category of an Agent, being a
retired Agent, and at this point there was no additional discussion
on this matter.

This document contains, neither recommendations nor conclusions of
the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your

INTERVIEW OF FORMER
SA DAVID E. TODD BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel was also told that nothing that was said by
former SA Todd should be interpreted as being critical of
the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) itself, and that if
the Bureau felt that such a Program was necessary in the interest
of national defense, he had carried it out in the best way he
saw fit, and that in recommending against specific proposals
as being impractical or inadvisable, these recommendations were
against the specific incidents recommended and not against the
Program as a whole.

Seidel's first questions dealt with former SA Todd's
background and the extent of his Bureau service, and whether
he had worked security or criminal matters. Former SA Todd
gave him chronologically the offices in which he had served
in the Bureau, and stated he had been associated from 1952 to
1956 with the Domestic Intelligence Division, Washington, D.C.,
and had become Supervisor in San Francisco in December, 1969,
of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and that during his Bureau
career he had worked both criminal and security matters.

Seidel asked the name of. the squad which was originally
the Racial Squad, and subsequently changed to Extremist Matters,
and he asked whether the work was strictly intelligence, or
whether it combined intelligence or criminal work. It was
pointed out Bombing Matters were originally being handled on
this Squad for a period of time, and that both the criminal
activities of the Panthers, as well as intelligence activities,

5 “were combined in the assignment.

ott Seidel then asked when the technical surveillances on
the Panthers were installed. Former SA Todd replied that they
were functioning at the time he was appointed Supervisor. Seidel
then asked how was the technical surveillance related to the
COINTEL, if at all, and specifically whether information coming
from the technical surveillance was used in carrying. out the
COINTEL. Former SA Todd advised that he Could not recall -
specifically what was done in either Program without reviewing
the files and comparing the information therein with the source.
Seidel seemed very interested in this, but actually the question
could not be answered on the basis of recollection alone, and
was not.

SSC; :
INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked how would the Panther COINTEL
be defined with regard to aims, techniques and results. The
answer to this was that the aims were to counter generally the
revolutionary objectives and activities of the Panthers. The
question concerning techniques was left unanswered, and as
far as results go, former SA Todd told Seidel that he did not
feel there had been any great results from the Program as it was
pursued in the San Francisco Office, but he could not speak
for the rest of the Program as far as the Bureau is concerned.

Seidel asked whether the Agents working the criminal
aspects of the BPP received information that was received from
a technical source, and he was told procedures by which
information had been routed to them in their cases, and that at
the time we operated these technical surveillances, we felt they
had been installed lawfully, and that the information received
could be used.

Seidel asked whether there was a great deal of pressure
put on the San Francisco Office for the development of informants.
He was told yes, that informants were the backbone of good law
enforcement and the Bureau constantly urged better informant
coverage.

Seidel asked if there had been similar pressure placed
on the office in the COINTEL, and former SA Todd replied that
7 .he did not feel that any great pressure had been put on the
office to carry out this Program, but that the Bureau had recom-
.mended the Program, however, had left it up to the office
pretty much as to how it should be carried out.

Pate Seidel asked whether the Program had been successful
in causing dissen%ion within the Party. Former SA Todd told
him that he did not feel this had been particularly effective
in any way, and that causing dissefzion had not been a primary
objective of the Program in the San Francisco Office, and‘that
the policy had been to use the Program for primarily two
purposes: 1) for the purpose of developing informants by
attempting to dissuade them from their loyalties to the Party;
and 2) to make representations to Panthers for whom outstanding
arrest warrants had been issued in order to flush them out so
they could be apprehended.

SSC;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER
SA DAVID E. TODD BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel asked specifically about the COINTEL involving
the Breakfast Program, and was told a recommendation had been
made for putting some kind of -contamination in the Breakfast
Program food, and that this office had felt this extremely
inadvisable and recommended against it, and it was not carried
out here.

Former SA Todd was also asked about a COINTEL
proposal relating to "The Black Panther" newspapers, and was
told that such a proposal had been made involving saturating
the papers with a foul smelling fish oil or some substance,
however, we recommended against this as it would serve no purpose.

Seidel was advised that the San Francisco policy had
been to recommend against harassment, per se, and also recommended
against leaking information to the press. Seidel then raised
the question about the incident where Huey P. Newton's high
standard of living was given to the press, and he was told
that this fell into the category of informant development on
the basis it was felt that if those Panthers who were living
practically in poverty could realize what Newton's standards
of living were, it might change their allegifnce to him and
they could be contacted for informant purposes.

Seidel was also told that in this phase of the
COINTEL, it was former SA Todd's recollection that this infor-
: mation regarding Newton's high standard of living had been
‘disseminated by informants, and that the press was well aware
of Newton's standards of living without having to make this
information available to them.

Seidel asked what the instructions had been from the
Bureau in carring out the COINTEL. Former SA Todd told Seidel
that he had reviewed this file after being appointed Supervisor,
but could not recall specifically what the Bureau instructions
were. The only other instructions received were at a two day
conference in Washington, D.C., on BPP matters conducted by
former Assistant to the Director William Sullivan, and Section
Chief George Moore, at which time it was pointed out that the
Bureau desired the COINTEL to be coordinated with the Bureau,
but that former SA Todd did not recall any firm prohibition against

NW 55160 DocId:32989641 “Page 139



SSC;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER
SA DAVID E. TODD BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

taking certain actions without Bureau authority, and that the
field had some leeway in what they did, but, in general, offices
made proposals to the Bureau with copies to San Francisco

prior to taking any action. Seidel asked why San Francisco

got copies of all proposals, and was told this was because

San Francisco was office of origin in the BPP case and other
offices were required to furnish a copy of all correspondence.

Seidel then asked to what extent Special Agent in
Charge Charles W. Bates had knowledge of the COINTEL as it
related to the BPP, and he was told that former SA Todd could
not speak for Bates and his knowledge would be dependent upon
how carefully he read incoming mail and reviewed files, and :
former SA Todd had no knowledge as to what extent Bates did this.

Seidel was told that under the supervisory setup in the
office at the time, former SA Todd felt it was his responsibility
to direct this Program in San Francisco and not Bates.

Seidel indicated that out of his investigation in the
hearings, undoubtedly there would be some legislation coming
out of Congress that would either enable or prohibit such
things as the COINTEL, and he stated that was one reason he
was asking concerning its effectiveness, and wondered what former
SA Todd would recommend. Seidel was told that former SA Todd
felt it essential that the Government should have the right to
.defend itself against individuals and groups who advocate
violent revolution or who are aligned with foreign powers,

.and that there was a need for some sort of legislation within
the framework of constitutional government which would enable
the Yovernment to do this; but, of course, it should be done
under. proper control. Seidel asked for suggestions as to what
sort of control, and was told that this was a matter for
Congress to decide, but perhaps Congress should look, into some
legislation similar to wiretap legislation, where the responsi-
bility is upon a Federal judge to issue a warrant.

Former SA Todd had prepared a brief summary of what
he recalled of the activities of the BPP, and he made a copy of
this available to Seidel. Former SA Todd also had made a
chronology to assist him in answering questions, together with

NW 55160 DocId:32989641 Page 140



SSC;

some notes concerning COINTEL policy, former SA Todd's general
| recollection of matters, questions of law regarding agent -

| princip#, privileged information problems, ongoing litigation
i and national defense, and informants and sources. Seidel asked
for a copy of this chronology and this, too, was given to him.

Seidel expressed great interest in receiving the one
page summary of the Panthers' activities, and stated that he
had chosen the Panthers for a case study, and he seemed more
interested in this than in the COINTEL. He also indicated that
there might be future interviews and that former SA Todd might
be called as a witness before the Committee at a later date.

At the outset of the interview, Seidel asked whether
former SA Todd desired his rights be read to him. Former
SA Todd told him that since he did not interpret this as a
custodial interview, and it was his understanding Seidel had no
police power, that he could forego reading the rights.

Former SA Todd did not feel it was necessary to
consult with a Bureau representative at this time.

The above information was furnished by former SA Todd
voluntarily and was not solicited.

atte te the 'inve@zation of the Black Panther Party was a

National Defense matter, Information on file points to colla-
boration with foreign powers by leaders of the Party.

: Throughout the two-year period in which I supervised
the investigation there were strong liaisons between Black Panthers
-and dissident groups abroad as well as with the governments of
foreign nations, ‘The Black Panthers had support and/or branches
in France, Germany and Scandinavia, and were international in
scope. Eldridge Cleaver, wanted on felony warrants, had been
granted asylum in Algeria and with his entourage was residing
in a villa provided by the Algerian government, During this
period he made at least one trip to-iioscow, Russia, Several
Black Panthers travelled to Cuba, Huey Newton, in 1971, travelled
to Red China by way of Canada and Hong Xong at the invitation *
of the,Chinese government at a time when the United States had
no di ophiaatic relations with then,

At the time I began serving as supervisor in late 1969,
the Black Panther Party was under co-leadership of Huey Newton,
then confined to vrison in California, and Eldridge Cleaver, living .
in exile in Algeria, The Black Panther Party, both in the news—
paper it published weekly at San Francisco, and in public statements
by its officers and leaders, advocated violent revolution; it
published instructions on guerrilla warfare, directions for the use
of weanons, and printed detailed drawings and instructions on
the manufacture of bombs and explosive devices, and it agitated
openly for the murder of volice officers, The term "off the
pigs," waich means "kill the police," was a Black Panther catch.
phrase, The history of the Black Panther Party during the period
T acted as supervisor is replete with incidents of murder, violence
and inciting to revolution. The revolutionary quotation of Mao-
Tse-Tung, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,"
becdme a Black Panther motto.

Sometime in early 1971 a split occurred in the Black
Panther. Party, Huey Newton, following his release from prison
- 4in 1970, gained control of one faction headquartered in Berkeley,
California, and he broke openly with Zldridge Cleaver, publicly
expelling Cleaver and Cleaver's lieutenents from the Party, The -
Newton faction thereafter graduelly took a more moderate approach,
‘ advocating social change through community service in place of its
prior profile of violence. No change was noted in the policies of
the Cleaver faction directed from Algiers, and it continued to
advocate violent revolution; it began publication in New York
of its own newspaper proclaiming itsrevolutionary policies; and
followers belonging to this faction continued to commit crimes of
violence, :

The following crimes of violence attributed to the Cleaver

faction of the Black Panthers have been documented in the book "Target
' Blue," by former Deputy Police Commissioner Robert Daley of New York

City (Dell Publishing Co,, Inc., 1973): i ‘

: Ambush attacks against police officers which resulted in

7 officers murdered, 3 wounded, and one attempted murder thwarted, which
led to the solution of tne other cases and established these attacks
to be a nationwide conspiracy; and the murder of two Newton-faction
Black Panthers, . q+

INTERVIEW OF SAC (CHARLES W. BATES
BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

On the evening of August 11, 1975, Mr. Lester Seidel
and Mr. Loch Johnson, Staff Members of the Senate Select
“Committee, met with Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates
of the San Francisco Office. This meeting occurred over dinner.
No statements ‘were made by either of these individuals as to
any. rights that SAC Bates: might have in connection with the

i interview. : 7

During the dinner, Mr. Seidel referred to COINTELPRO
involving the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party
in San Francisco, Bates advised him that he was in charge of
the San Francisco Office from July, 1967 until the end of
April, 1970, when he was transferred to Chicago.. Bates stated
that he was aware of the investigation being conducted on the
Black Panther Party but was not personally conversant with
all the details of this investigation as such details were
all contained in the FBI's file. On at least two occasions
Mr. Seidel referred to specific facts occurring in other parts
of the country involving anonymous letters sent to individuals
under COINTELPRO. He asked if Bates agreed that these actions
were proper. Mr. Seidel was told that Bates had no way of
I knowing the facts as he related were true or any other of
the circumstances involved and that, therefore, he was unable
to comment at all.

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates had any recommendations
. for legislation which the Committee could propose that would
assist the FBI in the domestic counterintelligence field.
Bates informed him that he was not fully conversant with this
entire field and that it was the prerogative of FBI officials
-at Washington and Department of Justice officials to recommend
such legislation.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaried to your

Mr. Seidel also inquired as to whether Bates felt
that an extension of electronic surveillances into the domestic
intelligence field would be of assistance. Bates informed
him that the FBI was operating according to current court
decisions as invélve electronic surveillances and that the
courts had recently precluded this action in strictly domestic
intelligence matters. Mr. Seidel was informed that this was
a decision for FBI officials in Washington.

On several occasions during the evening, Mr. Johnson
asked Bates if he was aware of the "Houston Plan." On each
occasion Bates informed him that he was not aware of the
“Houston Plan" and his only knowledge of it is what he has
seen in the public press. At one time Mr. Johnson asked if
Bates thought that Mr. Hoover had turned down the "Houston
Plan" because he was afraid for his. job. Bates again replied
that he had no firsthand knowledge having anything to do with
the “Houston Plan" but he was certainly aware that Mr. Hoover
was not afraid of anything or anyone.

Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt
that the use of "black bag jobs" would be of advantage in
conducting domestic counterintelligence operations. Bates
-replied that he had no personal direct knowledge of such matters
and had never been involved in such matters.

During the evening, Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt
that a congressional oversight committee of the FBI was sound
and proper. Bates informed that he certainly agreed with the
concept of congressional oversight as long as it was constructive
and not destructive. Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt that the
FBI's security operation should be completely divorced from
its ‘criminal responsibilities and handled as a separate agency
or a separate part of the FBI. Bates informed him that it
appeared that the FBI's efforts in both the criminal and the
security field had been effective and appeared to be proper
in its present context. Mr. Seidel inquired if Bates was
personally acquainted with Mr. William C. Sullivan, former
FBI official. Mr. Seidel was informed that Bates worked in
the same division with Mr. Sullivan in the 1950's and knew
him as another supervisor at FBI Headquarters.

Seidel then asked if Bates was aware of the dis-
agreements that Mr. Sullivan had had with Mr. Hoover and he
was informed that he had no details concerning this matter.

INTERVIEW OF SAC

CHARLES W. BATES {
BY_SSC_ STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates knew former SAC Harry
Morgan. Bates told him that he knew him as he had replaced
him as SAC in San Francisco at the end of April, 1970.. He
then asked if Bates was aware of why Mr. Morgan was transferred
from San Francisco. Bates told him that some problem had
arisen in connection with his running the San Francisco Office

‘but that he was not personally aware of the specific details.

but that they would be available at FBI Headquarters. Seidel
said the only reason he was asking was that he was thinking
about interviewing Mr. Morgan but he did not want to embarrass
him and then asked if Morgan's transfer from San Francisco
had anything to do with a drinking problem. Bates said again
that he was not aware of the specifics.

On the afternoon of August 13, 1975, Mr. Loch Johnson
came inte the San Francisco FBI Office saying he had just a
few more questions he wanted to ask Bates. He then asked if
the San Francisco Office was involved in foreign counter-
intelligence work, and he was informed that we were as were
many other FBI offices. He then asked if we surveilled every-
one who went into or came out of the Soviet Consulate in San
Francisco. He was informed that Bates did not intend to dis-
cuss with him any investigative techniques or anything having
to do with pending investigations. Mr. Johnson said he was
attempting to find some individual who was an expert in foreign
counterintelligence, particularly the Soviet threat to the
United States. Bates informed him that there were probably
a number of people in the United States who would qualify in
this category but Bates did not consider himself as an expert
in this field.

INTERVIEW ‘OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

Is it necessary for agent to express an opinion
as to morality, legality of said Counterintelligence
Program (COINTEL) ?

Answer: You are not obliged to answer those
questions you do not desire to answer, but if you wish you
may comment on the legality or morality of the plan.

SA DENNIS MILLER related that he desired that it
be borne in mind that the Bureau in no way wished to impede
the SSC investigation. -

: LESTER B. SEIDEL, SSC Staff Member, appeared at the
San Francisco Office of the FBI on August 11, 1975, and
interviewed ‘SA LEO BRENNEISEN from 1:03 PM to 2:30 PM.
SEIDEL prefaced the interview by explaining that he had
been advised that BRENNEISEN was the Coordinator for the
COINTEL in San Francisco from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1970.
It was pointed out to him that the case was assigned to
agent from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1971.

SEIDEL asked if agent had, in fact, approved all
proposals coming from the San Francisco Office. He was
advised that not necessarily because if another agent made
a proposal the person approving it in San Francisco would
be the person signing the outgoing mail, namely, the Supervisor
ox Relief Supervisor.

SEIDEL asked what Squad agent had been assigned
to during this Program, and he was advised S-6. He inquired
if there was any COINTEL in San Francisco against US; he
was advised to the contrary. He inquired as to the usual
number of cases assigned agent, and was advised that to
agent's best recollection probably 30 at any one time. He
asked if agent's work was exclusively security during the.
handling of the COINTEL Program and he was advised agent
did have some criminal assignments. He inquired if there
was any relationship between COINTEL and criminal assignments,
and he was advised no and that agent desired to limit the
scope of his questioning to the COINTEL Program.

SEIDEL then asked how many suggestions the agent
had submitted in COINTEL. He was advised that an estimate
would be difficult but probably the nearest figure would be
some two suggestions a’ month-with possibly six months in
two years when no suggestions were made. He inquired as
to agent's knowledge of what percentage of total proposals
from all sources submitted to the Bureau had been approved,
and he was advised only a small percentage.

“U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

: At this point, SEIDEL requested agent to outline the
types of COINTEL proposals submitted by San Francisco. He
was answered that anonymous letters, letters with pseudonyms,
and letters signed with the name of an existing person had
been used. a :

It was pointed out that the program had included
the use of anonymous letters, including those directed to
landlords advising that the Black.Panther Party was occupying
their property; letters to people supporting BEP programs,
including the Breakfast Program and enclosing copies of the
BPP color book for children encouraging the shooting of
police officers and/or articles from the "Black Panther
Party", the official BPP newspaper, showing their propensity
and advocacy of violence; letters to organizations containing
articles that showed the BPP in direct opposition to their
aims, such as a letter to a Jewish organization showing BPP
support of Palestine guerrillas...

It was pointed out that letters had been directed
to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER in Aigeria in the names of BPP members.
At this point, SEIDEL interrupted to explain that he was
enlisting the complete cooperation of the interviewee, that
there had been some Congressional criticism of the COINTEL,
that there were some segments of the population that were
anti-FBI and that he desired to present the FBI in a proper
light, and that he had good friends in the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked, was it necessary to have utilized
COINTEL. Agent advised that it was difficult to correctly.
judge the effect of the program but it was felt it was not
without some effect because the Black Panther Party had not
only dwindled from a membership of approximately 1,000 in
1969 to perhaps 200 in 1973, but that the organization became
split with dissension and had dropped much of its former
advocacy for violence.

SEIDEL then requested that the agent give his
recommendation on what COINTEL in the future should be;
whether there should be a division between security and
criminal investigations to different agencies in order that
a possible intrusion on the rights of an individual in '
intelligence matters might not necessarily preclude his
being prosecuted by the Bureau in a criminal matter. Agent

t NW 55160 DociId:32989641 Page 150



U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

refused to furnish his "“off-thscuff" opinion, pointing
out that he felt that it was without the scope of his
release.

Without further questioning agent concerning the
types of COINTEL proposals, SEIDEL next asked if the
Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) on the BPP was in operation
at the time COINTEL was initiated, and what proposals were
submitted in COINTEL based on information from ELSUR.

SEIDEL was advised agent's release would not allow
him"to discuss ELSUR.

SEIDEL asked if- the San Francisco Division had made
any "snitch" proposals. When asked to clarify the question,
he stated that this was a suggestion to the effect that a
Black Panther Party member be accused of being an FBI
informant. Agent replied that to the best of his recollection
no such recommendations had been made to the Bureau by San
Francisco, dnd on the contrary, agent knew that it had been
pointed out by San Francisco that any such allegation. should
be most carefully considered inasmuch as BPP history has
indicated that they had dealt severely with suspected infor-
mants, even to the point of killing them.

SEIDEL then asked if the San Francisco Division
had received a great deal of “flak" from the Bureau on this
program. He was advised that the Bureau operates a "tickler
system" for following investigations and that the program
had received some priority from the FBI but agent had never
considered correspondence from the Bureau as being -."flak".

7 SEIDEL at this point instead of questioning made
the statement that the Bureau gave this matter "high Sannin
No comment was made to this statement.

SEIDEL next questioned agent if he had read any
publicity concerning a May 11, 1970 letter from the Bureau

-to San Francisco entitled, "Special Operations Research", in

which it was suggested that some consideration be given to
furnishing the BPP spurious documents that supposedly
originated with the Oakland Police Department and the FBI.
He explained that some newSpaper had received a copy of the
document under the Freedom of: Information Act and thereafter
onan it. He inquired if a response to the letter

NW 55160 Docld:32989641 Page 151
Ey



U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

“had been made by San Francisco. Agent advised that it was
: his recollection that San Francisco had responded recommending
! against both proposals, pointing out that the BEP had in the
short past published contingency plans of the Berkeley Police

i Department fox a raid on National Headquarters to the
i embarrassment of that agency. San Francisco was of the
| opinion that if spurious documents were furnished to the

BPP they would immediately publish them, rather than attempt

to develop an informant and the operation presented a great
- deal of possible embarrassment and publicity for the Bureau.

SEINEL asked for agent's knowledge of why the letter
| - had been captioned as previously described rather than
Counterintelligence Program, Black Panther Party. Agent
stated he had no recollection of exact caption of the letter.
SEIDEL then went on to explain that he had been advised that
the Bureau had several COINTELS and the one covering Special
Operations Research was a COINTEL covering foreign operations.
Agent made“no comment.

SEIDEL requested what proposals had been made to
disrupt the BPP newspaper; how did the proposals originate,
and what offices submitted them. He was advised that it was
agent's recollection that the Bureau may have requested
suggestions from several offices but that to agent's knowledge
none had been approved. When SEIDEL continued to question the
agent concerning specific proposals and why their approval
was not recommended by San Francisco, he was advised that one
proposal was the use of a foul~smelling chemical to put on
the paper. San Francisco was of the opinion it would not

. be practical inasmuch as it would contaminate an airplane
- and would subject the airline or the printing company to
damages. SEIDEL was further advised that it was believed
the suggestion may have been made for the changing of a first
page of an issue at the printing company to embarrass the BPP,
but it was pointed out that this would also merely result in
-a claim being filed against the printer.

SEIDEL was advised that there may have been a
suggestion that some thought should be given to the possible
delay of the plates for the paper, that suggestion coming
at the time when the paper was being printed in New York
with the master copy being filmed in San Francisco. San
Francisco did not suggest apptoval because a mere delay would
have been of little benefit because the paper was not timely.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
a INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

SEIDEL asked about the disruption of the BPP
Breakfast Program. The answer was given that agent had
no recollection of this, and SEIDEL was asked did he have
any information from the Bureau that we had attempted a
disruption of the program in San Francisco. He related
that he believed not and that it probably happened in
San Diego.

SEIDEL asked about a suggestion that informants
set up a possible confrontation between the BPP and the
Republic of New Africa (RNA). Agent stated he had no
recollection of such a proposal and did not believe it had
been submitted by San Francisco because the membership and
activity in RNA had been minimal in this area.

SEIDEL then asked if we had suggested that landlords
in the San Francisco area be encouraged to insist on their
rent from the BPP. Agent advised he had no recollection
of this, but could see nothing wrong in it.

SEIDEL inquired as to the amount of knowledge
that SAC CHARLES BATES would have had concerning COINTEL.
He was advised that agent had no information, that he, himself,
had never discussed the program with Mr. BATES while it was
in operation. SEIDEL then inquired if former SAC HARRY
MORGAN had’ been ill during the time he was assigned to San
Francisco and the reason for his transfer. Agent replied
he had no information concerning this matter.

SEIDEL was asked if he felt that anyof the actions
agent described as being taken by the San Francisco Division
were illegal. SEIDEL stated that he did not believe that
these were matters that were in violation of any existing
criminal statutes, but there might be some question as to
whether the FBI had the specific authority to do these things.

. SEIDEL ended the interview by again reiterating
that he was a friend of the Bureau, that he was making an

~ inquiry and desired to obtain the opinions of both Headquarters
and agents in the field, and that he may make a request to the
Bureau to widen the scope of be beielas s release.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER (SA ALBERT P. CLARK) BY

SSC_STAFF MEMBER

On August 13, 1975, former Special Agent Albert P.
Clark, who was a supervisor in the San Francisco FBI Office
and who retired in December of 1969, advised as follows:

He was interviewed in his home at 66 Elm,
Larkspur, California, by SSC Member Lester B. Seidel from
5:40 P.M. to 6:55 P.M., August 12, 1975.

Clark was not placed under oath and no mention
was made of his rights. However, Seidel was pleasant and
in no way antagonistic. The interview was general, not
penetrative, not in depth, and very few specific questions were
asked. There appeared to be no discernible criticism of
either the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) or the
Bureau's investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) by
Seidel.

Seidel was compelled on more than one occasion
to declare that he was pro-FBI, that the object of his
inquiries was to assist the United States Senate in under-
standing the problem in order that they could consider
possible legislation that may eliminate any abuses in the
future.

Seidel did mention the fact several times that
information had been leaked to the press that Ja Seberg,
the movie actress, had become pregnant by a BPP official.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY
SSC_STAFF MEMBER

Seidel finally asked Clark if he would have okayed
a COINTEL proposal like this and he answered that he would
have if he felt that it would have sufficiently hindered
the BPP, stating that possibly in some of these occasions
someone might get hurt but on the other hand, investigation
of the BPP by the FBI might be made easier and it might
also cut down on the number of BPP supporters.

Clatk was asked to whom the main BPP case was
assigned and to whom COINTEL had been assigned in the San
Francisco Division. Clark replied that he did not rémember
but possibly during the time of his supervision, more than
one Agent -had handled the matters.

Seidel asked how many BPP informants the San
Francisco Division had. Clark replied he did not recall
and::.2 he did not believe that Seidel had a right to know.

Seidel inquired about the BPP wiretap,. asking
who had requested the tap, the Bureau or the San Francisco
Division. Again, Clark replied that he did not recall but
the San Francisco Division would not have necessarily
waited for the Bureau to initiate the matter but might have
requested the Bureau rather than the Bureau having initiated
the matter.

Seidel wanted to have an example of a COINTEL
‘proposal. He was not given a specific example but general
conversation was had to the effect that any move that might
be suggested that would aid the San Francisco Division in
their investigation of the BPP in determining their
supporters and financiers and possibly disenchanting those
individuals might be an example.

Seidel did not ask Clark whether he had done a
particular thing.

Questioned concerning whether he felt COINTEL had
been effective, Clark replied he did not believe the matter
was susceptible to proof but the BPP had sure gone into a
steep decline. . 7

DocId: 32989641 Page 156



U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel again brought up the Seberg matter and
asked if it had done any good. Clark stated he replied,
“Maybe.”

During this conversation, Clark: got the general
impression that perhaps Seidel did not feel that COINTEL
had been necessary but Clark had argued that it had made
the BPP more difficult to operate-and possibly easier
for the FBI to investigate.

Seidel then wanted to know what there was about
the BPP that caused such a concentration of FBI investi-
gative attention. Clark pointed out that this would have
to be answered in the context of -time, that at the time the
program was initiated, there was no doubt that the BPP
was a violent, racist organization opposing all law enforce-
ment, attacking officers and generally disturbing the
tranquility of the community.

Seidel then went on to discuss the business of
pressure. Had Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates
and the Bureau put too much pressure on the matter? Clark
stated there was undoubtedly pressure because everyone
was interested in doing the best type job possible and
finding out everything possible concerning the BPP. There
was obvious pressure from the Bureau in the matter and the
Bureau, in a case like this, could never be satisfied.
Clark stated that he related that perhaps too much
pressure had come from the Bureau because he had felt at
the time he was a supervisor that San Francisco Division
knew more about the BPP than the Bureau. On the other
hand, he related that Bureau officials were probably
under pressure because of the national interest and the
demands on them in Washington.

: Seidel related that he was interested in ascer-
taining what Agent would make the best witness to appear
in Washington to explain and testify concerning COINTEL.
He specifically requested Clark's recommendation and mentioned
the names of Special Agents Leo S. Brenneisen of San
Francisco and Bob Baker of Los Angeles. Clark stated that
he had countered by suggesting that somebody in Washington
who directed the program and approved all proposals might
be a better witness.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

Clark recalled that near the first of the inter-
view, Seidel probably, more to make conversation than to
obtain information, asked a few questions concerning US
and the Republic of North Africa (RNA). He was advised
that US had not been active in this division and there had
been no pertinent RNA activity brought to his attention.
Seidel asked if Ron Karenga of US had visited San Francisco
and Clark replied he had no exact recollection of this.

Seidel talked and asked Clark's opinion on the
separation into different agencies of the Bureau's criminal
and security investigations. Clark stated that he told
Seidel that in the past he had considered this and felt that
frankly it might have advantages, and at the same time,
might have disadvantages. He pointed out that the
disadvantages were that you could not be sure that it, in
fact, would work and that if you remove the security
investigations from the Bureau, you would undoubtedly
lose a great deal, including public support.

Seidel asked if Clark had worked under former
SAC Harry Morgan. He advised that he had retired prior to
the time Morgan was assigned to the San Francisco Division.

Clark pointed out that during the interview, a
recorder appeared prominently on his desk, and Seidel
could, of course, not be sure that it was not in operation;
although as the duration of the interview lengthened, it
must have been obvious to Seidel that it was not operating.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER\SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET) BY
SSC_ STAFF MEMBER

: On August 14, 1975, retired. former Special Agent -
William A. Cohendet was interviewed from 9:30 A.M. to
11:15 A.M. by Lester B. Seidel, Investigator for the U.S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence VActivitéS*(SSC) .

The interview took place at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness
Avenue, San Francisco.

Mr. Seidel mentioned that he was serving as a
counsel for the SSC, investigating all phases of the United
States intelligence community, and he had chosen the Black
Panther Party and the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL)
as his field. He stated that he was hoping for fuil

_ cooperation on the part of the former Special Agent.

He was advised that former Special Agent Cohendet
was willing. to cooperate with the committee and he trusted
that something constructive would come cut of the effort
being put forward. Former Special Agent. Cohendet also
pointed out that in his opinion the Black Panther Party (BPP)
had been a group devoted to violence, thievery, and fraud,
and the committee should realize the type of Subjects with
whom they are dealing in order to place the investigation
in its proper framework.

The first question concerned the former Special
Agent's background and Bureau service. This was briefly
furnished. :

Seidel then asked when and how the technical
‘surveillances had been installed, who initiated them, and
who approved then.

Hl The former Special Agent replied that he was
not party to any of these arrangements and did not know
any of the details.

i i Seidel then asked if former Special Agent
Cohendet knew the origin and purposes of the COINTEL
Program. He was informed that the former Agent did not
know the origin of the program, and said he believed'its
purposes were those as set forth in the instructions which
Seidel had’ and which spoke for themselves. The former
Agent admitted that said program at one time had been
assigned to him but due. to the press of other functions,
he had been unable to give ita great deal of time and
felt that during the period that it had been assigned to

-him, it had been largely ineffective.

Seidel then asked if there was any connection
between ELSUR and COINTEL and the reply was given that
obviously there would be if the ELSUR material being
reviewed could be considered as having any pertinence to
a COINTEL operation. However, former Special Agent Cohendet
could not recall having used this material while the case
was assigned to him, at least to any significant degree.
- Not having the files available made it impossible to :
state positively if there had been any specific instance sf? «s=
of this material.

Seidel asked as to the possible effectiveness of
anonymous letters and he was informed that in the opinion
of the former Agent, such letters, particularly having to

. do with personal infidelity or thievery, which were the
usual suggested avenues, would have little effect on the

- recipients who were active in such fields themselves much
of the time. In the more serious areas of perhaps trying
to falsely show that an individual was an FBI or police
informant, the former Special Agent said that the use of

| this technique would not be used for fear of causing bodily

harm or death to an innocent person due to the well-known
Z propensity of the BPP of dealing alee with any Suspected
| deviator let alone informant.

Seidel then asked as to the value of ELSUR to

the BPP investigation and the former Special Agent stated

that in his belief it was extremely valuable in many ways.

For instance, it assisted and gauged the true Huey Newton,

his plans, and weaknesses. It was also valuable in esti-
‘mating the possible effect of a certain COINTEL program

as possibly suggested by some other office. As a result

of their information, the San Francisco Office usually

rejected most suggestions as being unlikely to be successful.

Seidel wondered if ELSUR was not the most
valuable, single investigative aid that the Bureau had had
in this investigation, and the former Special Agent agreed
that he was probably correct.

Seidel then wondered if the COINTEL proposals
should be part of some legislation proposed by Congress
and the former Special Agent replied that the Bureau
officials, in his cpinion, should be allowed to comment
on this because the fact that the program would be ineffective
against the BPP might not be a valid argument that it would
not work to better advantage in other circumstances.

Former Special Agent Cohendet declined to
comment on the effectiveness of COINTEL as used against
the Socialist Workers Party, not infin had any experience
with its use in that field.

Seidel then asked about informants and asked if
there had been any pressure from the Bureau in the develop-
ment of such sources. Former Special Agent Cohendet
| - acknowledged that there certainly had been great pressure

i in this direction, as it was well known that informants were
a necessary part of any investigation and a police organi-
zation can never give up on this phase of its work no matter
how difficult the circumstances were in their development.
In the case of the BPP, the development of informants was
particularly difficult because of the fear that many persons
in the black community felt concerning the BPP as well as
the lack of desire to cooperate against another black
person. . :

Seidel asked about foreign funds being raised
and given to the BPP, and former Special Agent Cohendet
recalled that "Masai" Hewitt and others went to. Sweden i
and other countries where the BPP raised money on speech
making tours.

Seidel then asked about any investigation of
BPP funds and former Special Agent Cohendet said that it
was his recollection that investigation of BPP funds had
been undertaken through legal channels but he had no
personal knowledge of the investigation and declined to
go further into this field.

Seidel asked about referrals of Bureau information
‘to the Internal Revenue Service and former Special Agent
Cohendet said that he had no personal knowledge of what
had been done in this direction.

Actress Jean Seberg and “Masai" Hewitt, which had appeared
in a Hollywood gossip colum and had alleged that Seberg
had become pregnant by Hewitt. Seidel said that the Los
Angeles Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
admitted leaking this information to someone in the press.

Former Special Agent Cohendet knew that this
couple had been lovers for a brief period but denied any
knowledge of any leak to — press by either San Francisco
or Los Angeles.

: Seidel asked if the former Agent thought that
leaking this type of information was appropriate. No
- comment was offered as to this question.

Seidel, at the conclusion of the interview, said
that he had noted that the “faking" of police records as
suggested had never been undertaken and he observed that he
believed the COINTEL abuses were being overplayed by the
press. From what he learned in interviews in San Francisco,
it seemed to him that the program had been mostly played
down and indeed, an independent judgment had been exercised |

i
Seidel then asked about the affair between : |
|

in the implementation of the program.

| A general discussion of the BPP ensued in which

| former Special Agent -Cohendet reiterated the criminal
background and threatening attitude of many of the BPP
members, their mendacious ways, and their lack of credi-

. bility in their public statements. The former Special
Agent credited the news media with helping to build up
the BPP beyond its actual strength and influence.

Seidel asked about the former Agent's knowledge o? a a

for the removal of former SAC Harry Morgan from San
Francisco. He said the only reason he was asking this
guestion was in order to avoid embarrassing former SAC
Morgan when he interviews him concerning his possible
knowledge of BPP activities sometime in the future. Former
Special Agent Cohendet had no knowledge as to why

Mr. Morgan was transferred.

In summation, Seidel ventured the opinion that he
thought the ELSUR technique was far moré valuable in the
carrying out of the investigation of the BPP than the
COINTEL. Former Special Agent Cohendet had to agree
to the above observation.

: Former Special Agent Cohendet was not advised
of any rights that he might have in declining to answer
any questions and Seidel said he was actually seeking
witnesses for a possible hearing in Washington, D.C. He
Stated that no names would be mentioned in any write-up
‘he would make concerning his interviews.

' “On August 12, 1975, retired former SA David E. Todd
was interviewed from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. by Lester B. Seidel,
Investigator for the SSC. The interview took place at the

| Holiday Inn, San Francisco.

By way of background, in all contacts with Seidel
JERE previously, former SA Todd has indicated to him great reluctance
| to discuss these matters without clearance from the Bureau,
and pointed out to Seidel that the Bureau had released former . :
SA Todd from the Employment Secrecy Agreement for the purpose
H of a staff interview, but Seidel was told that former SA Todd
| did not think it was either his responsibility or his prerogative
to provide information or make information public; that while
| employed he was acting as an Agent of the Federal Government
| and felt it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to
| provide the information, and that.if the Senate Committee
| i desired information from former SA Todd, the questions should
“have been submitted to him in writing, and his answers should
have been made in writing and first forwarded to the FBI, and
‘then after the FBI determined it advisable to make these answers
available to the Committee, that would have been the proper
channel. :

Seidel pointed out the Committee and the Bureau had
made an agreement whereby the Bureau would make Agents available
to the Committee for interview. Former SA Todd pointed ott to
Seidel that he is not in the category of an Agent, being a
retired Agent, and at this point there was no additional discussion
on this matter.

Seidel was also told that nothing that was said by
former SA Todd should be interpreted as being critical of
the Counterintelligence Program’ (COINTEL) itself, and that if
the Bureau felt that such a Program was necessary in the interest
of national defense, he had carried it out in the best way he
saw fit, and that in recommending against specific proposals
as being impractical or inadvisable, these recommendations were
against the specific incidents recommended and not against the
Program as a whole.

Seidel's first questions dealt with former SA Todd's
background and the extent of his Bureau service, and whether
he had worked security or criminal matters. Former SA Todd
gave him chronologically the offices in which he had served
in the Bureau, and stated he had been associated from 1952 to
1956 with the Domestic Intelligence Division, Washington, D.C.,
and had become Supervisor in San Francisco in December, 1969,
of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and that during his Bureau
career he had worked both criminal and security matters.

Seidel asked the name of the squad which was originally
the Racial Squad, and subsequently changed to Extremist Matters,
and he asked whether the work was strictly intelligence, or
whether it combined intelligence or criminal work. It was
pointed out Bombing Matters were originally being handled on
this Squad for a period of time, and that both the criminal

7 activities of the Panthers, as well.as intelligence activities,
were combined in the assignment.

: Seidel then asked when the technical surveillances on
the Panthers were installed. Former SA Todd replied that they
were functioning at the time he was appointed Supervisor. Seidel
then asked how was the technical surveillance related to the :
COINTEL, if at all, and specifically whether information coming
from the technical surveillance was used in carrying out the
COINTEL. Former SA Todd advised that he Could not recall
specifically what was done in either Program without reviewing . j
the files and comparing the information therein with the source.
Seidel seemed very interested in this, but actually the question
could not be answered on the basis of recollection alone, and
was not. :

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

Seidel then asked how would the Panther COINTEL
be defined with regard to aims, techniques and results. The
answer to this was that the aims were to counter generally the
revolutionary objectives and activities of the Panthers. The
question concerning techniques was left unanswered, and as
far as results go, former SA Todd told Seidel that he did not

7 feel there had been any great results from the Program as it was
: pursued in the San Francisco Office, but he could not speak

for the rest of the Program as far as the Bureau is concerned.

Seidel asked whether the Agents working the criminal
aspects of the BPP received information that was received from
a technical source, and he was told procedures by which
information had been routed to them in their cases, and that at
the time we operated these technical surveillances, we felt they
had been installed lawfully, and that the information received
could be used.

Seidel asked whether there was a great deal of pressure
put on the San Francisco Office for the development of informants.
He was told yes, that informants were the backbone of good law
enforcement and the Bureau constantly urged better informant
coverage.

Seidel asked if there had been similar pressure placed
on the office in the COINTEL, and former SA Todd replied that
7 he did not feel that any great pressure had been put on the
office to carry out this Program, but that the Bureau had recom~
mended the Program, however, had left it up to the office
pretty much as to how it should be carried out.

Pa Seidel asked whether the Program had been successful
in causing dissenfion within the Party. Former SA Todd told
him that he did not feel this had been particularly effective
in any way, and that causing disserzion had not been a primary
objective of the Program in the San Francisco Office, and that
the policy had been to use the Program for primarily two
purposes: 1) for the purpose of developing informants by
attempting to dissuade them from their loyalties to the Party;
| and 2) to make representations to Panthers for whom outstanding
arrest warrants had been issued in order to flush them out so
they could be apprehended.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER
SA DAVID E. TODD BY

Seidel asked specifically about the COINTEL involving
the Breakfast Program, and was told a recommendation had been
made for putting some kind of .contamination in the Breakfast
Program food, and that this office had felt this extremely
inadvisable and recommended against it, and it was not carried
out here.

Former SA Todd was also asked about a COINTEL
proposal relating to "The Black Panther" newspapers, and was
told that such a proposal had been made involving saturating
the papers with a foul smelling fish oil or some substance,
however, we recommended against this as it would serve no purpose.

Seidel was advised that the San Francisco policy had
been to recommend against harassment, per se, and also recommended
against leaking information to the press. Seidel then raised
the question about the incident where Huey P. Newton's high
standard of living was given to the press, and he was told
that this fell into the category of informant development on
the basis it was felt that if those Panthers who were living
practically in poverty could realize what Neyton's standards
of living were, it might change their allegifnee to him and
they could be contacted for informant purposes.

" Seidel was also told that in this phase of the
COINTEL, it was former SA Todd's recollection that this infor-
Mation regarding Newton's high standard of living had been
disseminated by informants, and that the press was well aware
of Newton's standards of living without having to make this
information available to them.

o Seidel asked what the instructions had been from the
Bureau in carring out the COINTEL. Former SA Todd told Seidel
that he had reviewed this file after being appointed Supervisor,
but could not recall -specifically what the Bureau instructions
were. The only other instructions: received were at a two day
conference in Washington, D.C., on BPP matters conducted by
former Assistant to the Director William Sullivan, and Section
Chief George Moore, at which time it was pointed out that the
Bureau desired the COINTEL to be coordinated with the Bureau,
but that former SA Todd did not recall any firm prohibition against

taking certain actions without Bureau authority, and that the
field had some leeway in what they did, but, in general, offices
made proposals to the Bureau with copies to San Francisco

prior to taking any action. Seidel asked why San Francisco

got copies of all proposals, and was told this was because

San Francisco was office of origin in the BPP case and other
offices were required to furnish a copy of all correspondence.

Seidel then asked to what extent Special Agent in
Charge Charles W. Bates had knowledge of the COINTEL as it
related to the BPP, and he was told that former SA Todd could
not speak for Bates and his knowledge would be dependent upon
how carefully he read incoming mail and reviewed files, and
former SA Todd had no knowledge as to what extent Bates did this.

Seidel was told that under the supervisory setup in the
office at the time, former SA Todd felt it was his responsibility
to direct this Program in San Francisco and not Bates.

Seidel indicated that out of his investigation in the
hearings, undoubtedly there would be some legislation coming
out of Congress that would either enable or prohibit such
things as the COINTEL, and he stated that was one reason he
was asking concerning its effectiveness, and wondered what former
SA Todd would recommend. Seidel was told that former SA Todd
felt it essential that the Government should have the right to
defend itself against individuals and groups who advocate
violent revolution or who are aligned with foreign powers,
and that there was a need for some sort of legislation within
the framework of constitutional government which would enable
the government to do this; but, of course, it should be done
under. proper control. Seidel asked for suggestions as to what
sort of control, and was told that this was a matter for
Congress to decide, but perhaps Congress should look into some
legislation similar to wiretap legislation, where the responsi-
bility is upon a Federal judge to issue a warrant.

Former SA Todd had prepared a brief summary of what
he recalled of the activities of the BPP, and he made a copy of
this available to Seidel. Former SA Todd also had made a
chronology to assist him in answering questions, together with

recollection of matters, questions’ of law regarding agent -

and national defense, and informants and sources. Seidel asked
for a copy of this chronology and this, too, was given to him.

Seidel expressed great interest in receiving the one
page summary of the Panthers' activities, and stated that he
had chosen the Panthers for a case study, and he seemed more

interested in this than in the COINTEL.

consult with a Bureau representative at this time.

voluntarily and was not solicited.

f “ser y the investigM@on of the Black Panther Pty Was a
National Defense matter, Information on file points to colla~
poration with foreign powers by leaders of the Party.

Throughout the two-year period in which I supervised
the investigation there were strong liaisons between Black Panthers
and dissident groups abroad es well as with the governments of
foreign nations. The Black Panthers had support and/or branches
in France, Germany and Scandinavia, and were international in
scope. Eldridge Cleaver, wanted on felony warrants, had been
granted asylum in Algeria and with his entourage was residing
in a villa provided by the Algerian government. During this
period he made at least one trip to- Hoscow, Russia, Several
Black Panthers travelled to Cuba. Huey Newton, in 1971, travelled
to Red China by way of Canada and Hong Xong at the invitation *
of the,Chinese government at a time when the United States had
no di npliaatic relations with thems

At the time I began serving as supervisor in late 1969,
the Bleck Panther Party was under co-leadership of Huey Newton,
then confined to prison in California, and Eldridge Cleaver, living
in exile in Algeria. The Black Panther Party, both in the news.
paper it published weekly at San Francisco, and in public statements
by its officers and leaders, advocated violent revolution; it
published instructions on guerrilla warfare, directions for the use
of weapons, end printed detailed drawings ‘and instructions on
the manufacture of bombs and explosive devices, and it agitated
openly for the murder of volice officers, ‘The term “off the
pigs," wnich means "kill the police," was a Black Panther cetche
phrase, The history of the Black Panther Party during the period
I acted as supervisor is replete with incidents of murder, violence
and inciting to revolution, The revolutionary quotation of Mao~-
Tse-Tung, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,"
became a Black Panther motto,

Sometime in early 1971 a split occurred in the Black
Panther. Party, Huey Newton, following his release from prison
in 1970, gained control of one faction headquartered in Berkeley,
California, and he broke openly with Zldridge Cleaver, publicly
expelling Cleaver and Cleaver's lieutenants from the Party, The -
Newton faction thereafter gradually took a more moderate approach,
* advocating social change through community service in place of its
prior profile of violence. No change was noted in the policies of
the Cleaver faction directed from Algiers, and it continued to
advocate violent revolutions; it began publication in New York
of its own newspaper proclaiming itsrevolutionary policies; and
followers belonging to this faction continued to commit crimes of .-
violence, i

The following crimes of violence attributed to the Cleaver
faction of the Black Panthers have been documented in the- book "Target
Blue," by former Deputy Police Commissioner Robert Daley of New York
City (Dell Publishing Co., Ine., 1973): .

: _Ambush attacks against police officers which resulted in
7 officers murdered, 3 wounded, and one attempted murder thwarted, which
; led to the solution of the other cases and established these attacks ,
' to be a nationwide conspiracy; and the murder of two Newton-faction
| Black Panthers. Che

The Bureau's attention is directed to Bureau file

was opened by the Jackson Office 6/18/68, as a Confidential
Source - Racial, and case was closed by Jackson letter to the
Bureau, dated 9/12/69, During the period that the case was
open, this source was paid by this Bureau a total of $392.
At the time this subject was developed as a confidential
source, it was the distinct understanding between source and
Agents contacting him that all information furnished by him
would be held in strict confidence and the revelation of
information furnished by him would most assuredly result in
his, as' well as other members of his family, immediate death.
This Bureau has never violated that trust.

identified by JACK NELSON, who was then a staff writer for

the Los Angeles Times, in an article appearing on the front
page of that newspaper on February 13, 1970. A copy of that
article is enclosed.

N\ Item #3. C. GORDON LESTER CLARK

|

The indices of the Jackson Office revealed no
information furnished by this individual for period
5/1/68+8/31/68.

The Bureau's attention is directed to Byreau file
170-5883. Subject of this file is known to the Bureau and
was opened by the Jackson Office January 4, 1972.

This source's identity ms never been publicly
disclosed. Informant was sole source of information in the
Proposed bombing by BYRON DE LA BECKWITH of the residence
of A. I. BOTNICK, head of the Anti-Defamation League in
Louisiana and Mississippi, on or about September 27, 1973. It
is noted that during Federal and state trials, lasting approxi-
mately 2% years, that it appeared the primary function of the
defendants and their klan-type lawyers was to determine the
identity of informant in this case. Efforts were directed at
handling Agent on numerous occasions in an effort to have him
make some slip which would reveal identity of informant.
Numerous Federal court decisions were utilized and, in fact,
Agent was excused by State Judge from testifying since he was
convinced that any testimony in state court by the Agent would
reveal source's identity and possibly cost him his life.

In view of the above, the Bureau should make every
effort to insure source's identity is not disclosed.

eventually is interviewed he would certainly want to tell the
Bureau the results of the interview. In addition to the
trailer court address we have on record, Cox furnished an
address where he is more apt to be located, which is also a
trailer court. That address is number 353, 1300 South Airport
Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32910, telephone area code
305, 724-4104. Nothing was said to Cox concerning the
consultation aspects relating to interviews of former Agents,
as this is a matter under current study with possible change
in procedure to be effected.

In view of the conversation had with Cox on the
afternoon of 8/26/75, Phillips telephonically contacted
ASAC, John Beale of the Tampa Office and advised
him that no action need be taken by the Tampa Office in
attempt to locate Cox, as this has already been handled by
FBIHQ as above.

SUBJECT: "CHANGED"

00: Los Angeles

On 5/31/72, CSLA 6596-S advised DELLA COOVER is

using the pseudonym Bella Stumbo, so this matter has been
marked "changed".

CSLA indicated COOVER is using the Bella Stumbo
alias in connection with her position as a sta writer Tor
the "Los Angeles Times".

ACTION

ADEX should be changed to include the new alias and
subject's positiona a staff writer for the Times. Also,
since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,
for the Monterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested
that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue
Service that she may be receiving payroll checks under these
pseudonyms and not reporting her total income correctly. Appro-
priate investigation should be conducted to verify subject's
use of the additional pseudonym,

Donald Antelo's mother Beatrice, 59, is a devout

where she prays each night before going to bed.
She had just finished her rosary the night police
came looking for her son.

"There were four of them at the door, They
rushed through the houso, searching for Don, I
said he wasn't home, but what did they want him
for? And they said because he shot a little girl,
that my boy killed a child."

Beairice Antelo was sitting at her kitchen table,
staring listlessly at a cold cup of coffee in front of
her, her voice a weary whisper,

"They didn't have uniforms on, so I thought
maybe they were some of Don's friends playing a
pad joke. I told them to stop fooling around about,
sornething so awful."

She paused, fighting back tears. "And he cried

like a little ebild."

Then Beatrice Antelo, weary with an agony few
“mothers ever know, laid her head down on her ta-
ble and sobbed in helpless, hopeless despair.

Helen Hernandez, 49, and her husband Antonio,

58, sat side by side on their couch in a spotless liv-
ing room overflowing with glittering sports tro-
phies and photographs of their five sons, ages 22-
16. They looked stunned. like two people who
have tried, yet failed to comprehend fully ‘what
has happened to them this summer, 7

Which is probably understandable, for nothing
-in their experience has prepared them to deal with
a murder charge against a member of their family

She knew her son. He was a good boy. He loved least of all against Oscar, their quietest, oldest,

children. He and his girlfriend wanted to have a
big family when they got married—which would
‘be as soon as Don found a job. It isn't easy to find
a job'when you don't have a car to look outside the
barrio, she’ had explained.

Meantime, she pointed out, Don was a good stu-
dent at Cerritos College. He studied hard, made
good grades, "was determined to make something
out of himself." 7

Beatrice Antelo absentmindedly stroked a tiny
brown dog sleeping peacefully in her lap. He is
her watchdcg. When strangers approach the
house, he pokes his head through a broken living
room window pane and barks with comic ferocity.

Don had been in trouble hefore, of course, she
continued, an edge of bitterness creeping into her
voice as she told how he had been thrown out of
Excelsior High School four years ago because "he
had.long hair before it was common." He had
brushes with the police before, too, she said, with-
out elaborating—but most barrio youths have si-
milar experiences.

7 ‘Won't Care About Saving Him'

"You have to live here to know what it's like.
Police everywhere, poverty vou can't escape, no
jobs..." Her voice trailed off in a resigned shrug.
She makes Jess than $3,000 annually, so she can't
afford to hire a private attorney to defend her son,
she said. And she's certain the ‘court-appointed.
public defender “won't care about saving him."

$  Bashful Woman

Helen, a stout. bashful
woman with a fresh-
scrubbed, friendly face,
prone to twisting nervous-
ly at her wedding rings,
has always been single-
mindedly devoted to her
duties as a wife and moth-
er. Never has she even
considered working out-
side her home, though the
Hernandez family, like
most in the barrio, has al-
ways needed more money
than they have had.

‘Both devoted Jehovah's
Witnesses, the couple
have also enforced a rigid
brand. of religion in their
household. Their sons

Americans. Especially the
latter.

When Helen Hernan-
dez's 19-year-old son was
drafted, she 'heams, he
went to serve his country
without question. He was
in the Army for a year, un-
til an automobile accident

, earned him both a medical

idischarge and a-per-
manent speech impe-
diment. Now he works ina
Norwa packing plant.

Likewise, when Oscar?
Hernandez was drafted he
too went willingly, serving
as a guard at Da Nang Air
Force base in Vietnam un-
til his discharge with two
Bronze Stars, last sum-
mer. He had heen looking

"He never really talked

much about Vietnam. Ex-
cept he was glad he didn't
have to kill anyhody," says
Helen Hernandez, her
voice shy, hesitant.
__ "Oscar never liked to box
in high school either, he-
cause he didn't like to hit
anybody. So he played
baseball. And track."

She blushed, embar-
rassed, it seemed, to de-
fend her son's passive na~
ture.

Indeed, it soon becomes
amply apparent to a stran-
ger in the Hernandez
household that making ex-
cuses for Oscar—who is
accused of driving the car
that carried Joyce Ann
Huff's killer—is consid-
ered somehow undigni-
fied, even unpatriotic, in-

be done, the Hernan-
_dez couple have the added
solace, unlike Beatrice An-
telo, of having a private
attorney, a family friend,
who will represent their
son in court.
‘So Kasygoing*

- "Oscar was so quiet, so
easygoing. He stayed
home almost all the time,"
says Helen Hernandez
proudly. “Ile watched tele-
vision, he read a lot of
books and sports maga-
zines. And he always
helped me around the
house, Every morning we
made the beds together
and washed the dishes."

_ Abruptly, she vanished
into a back room, return-
ing instantly with a bulg-
ing photograph album, It
turned out to be what, in
her heart, Helen Hernan-
dez considers immutable
proof of her son's in-
nocence in this bizarre
episode.

“The book was filled with’
pictures Oscar had taken
in Vietnam — photos of
children. Waifs. orphans,
refugees who hung around
with Oscar and Oscar's
friends.

"He loved children," said
Helen Hernandez, as An-
tonio nodded vigorous
agreement. She looked
suddenly grim, as if she
hhad realized, maybe for
the first time, how serious-
jy important that point
might eventually become.

INTERVIEW OF SAC(CHARLES W. BATES

BY SSC STAFF MEMB:

On the evening of August 11, 1975, Mr. Lester Seidel

- and Mr. Loch Johnson, Staff Members of -the Senate Select

Committee, met with Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

of the San Francisco Office. This meeting occurred over dinner.
No statements were made by either of these individuals as to
any rights that SAC Bates might have in connection with the
interview.

7 During the dinner, Mr. Seidel referred to COINTELPRO
involving the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party
in San Francisco. Bates advised him that he was in charge of
the San Francisco Office from July, 1967 until the end of
April, 1970, when he was transferred to Chicago. Bates stated
that he was aware of the investigation being conducted on the
Black Panther Party but was not personally conversant with

all the details of this investigation as such details were

all contained in the FBI's file. On at least two occasions
Mr. Seidel referred to specific facts occurring in other parts
of the country involving anonymous letters sent to individuals
under COINTELPRO, He asked if Bates agreed that these actions
were proper. Mr. Seidel was told that Bates had no way of
knowing the facts as he related were true or any other of

the circumstances involved and that, therefore, he was unable
to comment at ail.

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates had any recommendations

. for legislation which the Committee. could propose that would

Nw 55160

assist the FBI in the domestic counterintelligence field. ~
Bates informed him that he was not fully conversant with this
entire field and that it was the prerogative of FBI officials

-at Washington and Department of Justice officials to recommend

such legislation.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your
agency; it and its contents are-not to be distributed outside

Mr. Seidel also inquired as to whether Bates felt

that an extension of electronic surveillances into the domestic
_ intelligence field would be of assistance. Bates informed

him that the FBI was operating according to current court

decisions as involve electronic surveillances and that the

courts had recently preclided this action in strictly domestic

intelligence matters. Mr. Seidel was informed that this was

a decision for FBI officials in Washington. 7

On several occasions during the evening, Mr. Johnson
asked Bates if he was aware of the “Houston Plan." On each
occasion Bates informed him that he was not aware of ‘the
“Houston Plan" and his only knowledge of it is what he has
seen in the public press. At one time Mr, Johnson asked if
Bates thought that Mr. Hoover had turned down the "Houston
Plan" because he was afraid for his job. Bates again replied
that he had no ‘firsthand knowledge having anything to do with
the “Houston Plan" but he was certainly eware that Mr. Hoover
was not afraid of anything or anyone.

Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt
that the use of “black bag jobs" would be of advantage in
conducting domestic counterintelligence operations. Bates
-replied that he had no personal direct knowledge of such matters
and had never been involved in such matters.

During the evening, Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt
that a congressional oversight committee of the FBI was sound
and proper. Bates informed that he certainly agreed with the
concept of congressional oversight as long as it was constructive
and not destructive. Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt that the
FBI's security operation should be completely. divorced from
its ‘criminal responsibilities and handled as a separate agency
or a Separate part of the FBI. Bates informed him that it
appeared that the FBI's efforts in both the criminal and the
-security field had been effective and appeared to be proper
in its present context. Mr. Seidel inquired if Bates was
personally acquainted with Mr. William C. Sullivan, former
FBI official. Mr. Seidel was informed that Bates worked in
the same division with Mr. Sullivan in the 1950's and knew
him as another supervisor at FBI Headquarters.

Seidel then asked if Bates was aware of the dis-
agreements that Mr. Sullivan had had with Mr. Hoover and he
was informed that he had no details concerning this matter.

INTERVIEW OF SAC

CHARLES W. BATES 4
BY_SSC_ STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates knew former SAC Harry
Morgan. Bates told him that he knew him as he had replaced
him as SAC in San Francisco at the end of April, 1970. He
then asked if Bates was aware of why Mr. Morgan was transferred
from San Francisco. Bates told him that some problem had
arisen in connection with his running the San Francisco Office
but that he was not personally aware of the specific details.
but that they would be available at FBI Headquarters. Seidel
said the only reason he was asking was that he was thinking
about interviewing Mr. Morgan but he did not want to embarrass
him and then asked if Morgan's transfer from San Francisco
had anything to do with a drinking problem. Bates said again
that he was not aware of the specifics.

On the afternoon of August 13, 1975, Mr. Loch Johnson
came into the San Francisco FBI Office saying he had just a
few more questions he wanted to ask Bates. He then asked if
the San Francisco Office was involved in foreigh counter-
intelligence work, and he was informed that we were as were
many other FBI offices. He then asked if we surveilled every-
one who went into or came out of the Soviet Consulate in San
Francisco. He was informed that Bates did not intend to dis~
cuss with him any investigative techniques or anything having
to do with pending investigations. Mr. Johnson said he was
attempting to find some individual who was an expert in foreign
counterintelligence, particularly the Soviet threat to the
United States. Bates informed him that there were probably
a number of people in the United States who would qualify in
this category but Bates did not consider himself as an expert
in this field.

“The above represents specific matters brought up
during these discussions.

INTERVIEW OF\SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN BY *% i

Prior to interview by SSC Staff Member, SA LEO S.
BRENNEISEN telephonically contacted SA DENNIS MILLER at
FBI Headquarters making four inquiries 6n Lugust 6, 1975;
on the same date, the following answers were received:

Is it permissible for agent to give general
answers concerning the Black Panther Party (BPP) as to
membership number and Chapter numbers at various dates?

Answer: Yes. z

Local media has previously set forth a memorandum
purportedly from.the FBI, San Francisco Office, suggesting
consideration should be given to furnishing fabricated
documents originating with the Oakland Police Department
and the FBI, San Francisco, when, in fact, the memorandum
came from the Bureau. If questioned concerning this memorandum,
may agent point out that this document originated with the
Bureau rather than San Francisco?

Answer: Yes.

In contemplation of possible questioning concerning
false correspondence directed to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and others
abroad, can agent refer SSC Staff to Bureau when questioned
concerning identity of agents.preparing correspondence?

Answer: Yes.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is: loaned to-
your agency; it and its contents are.not to be distributed

“\ U.S. SENATE 4 COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

Is it necessary for agent to express an opinion
as to morality, legality of said Counterintelligence
Program (COINTEL) ? ‘

Answer: You are not obliged to answer those
questions you do not desire to answer, but if you wish you
may comment on the legality or morality of the plan.

SA DENNIS MILLER related that he desired that it
be borne in mind that the Bureau in no way wished to impede
the SSC investigation. -

: LESTER B. SEIDEL, SSC Staff Member, appeared .at the
San Francisco Office of the FBI on August 11, 1975, and
interviewed SA LEO BRENNEISEN from 1:03 PM to 2:30 PM.
SEIDEL prefaced the interview by explaining that he’ had
been advised that BRENNEISEN was the Coordinator for the
COINTEL in San Francisco from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1970.
It was pointed out to him that the case was assigned to
agent from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1971.

SBIDEL asked if agent had, in fact, approved all
proposals coming from the San Francisco Office. He was
advised that not necessarily because if another agent made *&
a proposal the person approving it in San Francisco would
be the person signing the outgoing mail, namely, the Supervisor
or Relief Supervisor.

SEIDEL asked what Squad agent had been assigned
to during this Program, and he was advised S-6. He inquired
iff there was any COINTEL in San Francisco against US; he
was advised to the contrary. He inquired as to the usual
number of cases assigned agent, and was advised that to
agent's best recollection probably 30 at any one time. He
asked if agent's work was exclusively security during the
handling of the COINTEL Program and he was advised agent
did have some criminal assignments. He inquired if there
was any relationship between COINTEL and criminal assignments,
and he was advised no and that agent desired to limit the
scope of his questioning to the COINTEL Program.

SEIDEL then asked how many suggestions the agent
had submitted in COINTEL. He was advised that an estimate
would be difficult but probably the nearest figure would be
some two suggestions a month-with possibly six months in
two years when no suggestions were made. He inquired as
to agent's knowledge of what percentage of total proposals
from all sources submitted to the Bureau had been approved,
and he was advised only a small percentage.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

: At this point, SEIDEL requested agent to outline the
types of COINTEL proposals submitted by San Francisco. He
was answered that anonymous letters, letters with pseudonyms,
and letters signed with the name of an existing person had
been used. 7 :
It was pointed out that the program had included
u the use of anonymous letters, including those directed to
landlords advising that the Black.Panther Party was occupying
. their property; letters to people supporting BPP programs,
‘ including the Breakfast Program and enclosing copies of the
BPP ‘color book for children encouraging the shooting of
police officers and/or articles from the "Black Panther
Party", the official BPP. newspaper, showing their propensity
and advocacy of violence; letters to organizations containing
articles that showed the BPP in direct opposition to their
aims, such as a letter to a Jewish organization showing BPP
support of Palestine guerrillas.

It was pointed out that letters had been directed
to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER in Algeria in the names of BPP members.
At this point, SEIDEL interrupted to explain that he was
enlisting the complete cooperation of the interviewee, that
there had been some Congressional criticism of the COINTEL,
that there were some segments of the population that were
anti-FBI and that he desired to present the FBI in a proper
light, and that he had good friends in the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked, was it necessary to have utilized
€OINTEL. Agent advised that it was difficult to correctly _
judge the effect of the program but it was felt it was not
without some effect because the Black Panther Party had not
only dwindled from a membership of approximately 1,000 in
1969 to perhaps 200 in 1973, but that the organization became
split with dissension and had dropped much of its former
advocacy for violence.

SEIDEL then requested that the agent give his
“recommendation on what COINTEL in the future should be;
whether there should be a division between security and
criminal investigations to different agencies in order that _
a possible intrusion on the rights of an individual in
intelligence matters might not necessarily preclude his
being prosecuted by the Bureau in a criminal matter. Agent

: NW 55160 DocId:32989641 Page 213



U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

refused to furnish his “off-thscuff" opinion, pointing
out that he felt that it was without the scope of his
release.

Without further questioning agent concerning the
types of COINTEL proposals, SEIDEL next asked if the
Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) on the BPP was in operation

[aad at the time COINTEL was initiated, and what proposals were
submitted in COINTEL based on information from ELSUR.

SEIDEL was advised agent's release would not allow
him“to discuss ELSUR.

SEIDEL asked if- the San Francisco Division had made
any "snitch" proposals. When asked to clarify the question,
he stated that this was a’suggestion to the effect that a
Black Panther Party member be accused of being an FBI
informant. Agent replied, that to the best of his recollection
no such recommendations had been made to the Bureau by San
Francisco, dnd on the contrary, agent knew that it had been
pointed out by San Prancisco that any such allegation. should
be most carefully considered inasmuch as BPP history has
indicated that they had dealt severely with suspected infor-
mants, even to the point of killing them.

SEIDEL then asked if the San Francisco Division
had received a great deal of "flak" from the Bureau on this
program. He was advised that the Bureau operates a "tickler 7
system" for following investigations and that the program
had received some priority from the FBI but agent had never
considered correspondence from the Bureau as being -"flak".

q SEIDEL at this point instead of questioning made
the statement that the Bureau gave this matter "high priority".
No comment was made to this statement.

SEIDEL next questioned agent if he had read any
publicity concerning a May 11, 1970 letter from the Bureau
- to San Francisco entitled, "Special Operations Research", in
which it was suggested that some consideration be given to
furnishing the BPP spurious documents that supposedly
“ eriginated with the Oakland Police Department and the FBI.
He explained that some newspaper had received a copy of the
document under the Freedom of .Information Act and thereafter
-aiestnecaineae it. He inquired if a response to the letter

| NW 55160 DocId:32989641 Page 214 : a



2 7

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE oN
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

had been made by San Francisco. Agent advised that it was
his recollection that San Francisco had responded recommending
against both proposals, pointing out that the BEP had in the
short past published contingency plans of the Berkeley Police
Department for a raid on National Headquarters to the
embarrassment of that agency. San Francisco was of the
opinion that if spurious documents were furnished to the
BPP they would immediately publish them, rather than attempt

_ to develop an informant and the operation presented a great

- deal of possible embarrassment and publicity for the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked for agent's knowledge of why the letter
had been captioned as previously described rather than
Counterintelligence Program, Black Panther Party. Agent
stated he had no recollection of exact caption of the letter.
SEIDEL then went on to explain that he had been advised that
the Bureau had several COINTELS and the one covering Special
Operations Research was a COINTEL covering foreign operations.
Agent made no comment.

SEIDEL requested what proposals had been made to
disrupt the BPP newspaper; how did the proposals originate,
and what offices submitted them. He was advised that it was
agent's recollection that the Bureau may have requested
suggestions from several offices but that to agent's knowledge
none had been approved. When SEIDEL continued to questionthe
agent concerning specific proposals and why their approval
was not recommended by San Francisco, he was advised that one
proposal was the use of a foul-smelling chemical to put on
the paper. San Francisco was of the opinion it would not
be practical inasmuch as it would contaminate an airplane
and would subject the airline or the printing company to
damages. SEIDEL was further advised that it was believed
the suggestion may have been made for the changing of a first.
page of an issue at the printing company to embarrass the BPP,
but it was pointed out that this would also merely result in

-a claim being filed against the printer.

SEIDEL was advised that there may have been a
suggestion that some thought should be given to the possible
delay of the plates for the paper, that suggestion coming
at the time when the paper. was being printed in New York
with the master copy being filmed in San Francisco. San
Francisco did not suggest approval because a mere delay would
have .been of little benefit because the paper was not timely.

| NW 55160 Docld:32989641 Page 215



U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
a INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

SEIDEL asked about the disruption of the BPP
Breakfast Program. The answer was given that agent had
no recollection of this, and SEIDEL was asked did he have
any information from the Bureau that we had attempted a
disruption of the program in San Francisco. He related
that he believed not and that it probably happened in
San Diego.

SEIDEL asked about a suggestion that informants
set up a possible confrontation between the BPP and the
Republic of New Africa (RNA). Agent stated he had no
recollection of such a proposal and did not believe it had
been submitted by San Francisco because the membership and
activity in RNA had béen minimal in this area.

SEIDEL then asked if we had suggested that landlords
in the San Francisco area be encouraged to insist on their
rent from the BPP. Agent advised he had no recollection
of this, but could see nothing wrong in it.

SEIDEL inquired as to the amount of knowledge
that SAC CHARLES BATES would have had concerning COINTEL.
He was advised that agent had no information, that he, himself,
had never discussed the program with Mr. BATES while it was
in operation. SEIDEL then inquired if former SAC HARRY
MORGAN had been ill during the time he was assigned to San
Francisco and the reason for his transfer. Agent replied
whe had no information concerning this matter.

SEIDEL was asked if he felt that anyof the actions
agent described as being taken by the San Francisco Division
were illegal. SEIDEL stated that he did not believe that
these were matters that.were in violation of any existing
criminal statutes, but there might be some question as to
whether the FBI had the specific authority to do these things.

SEIDEL ended the interview by again reiterating
that he was a friend of the Bureau, that he was making an
inquiry and desired to obtain the opinions of both Headquarters
and agents in the field, and that he may make a request to the
Bureau to widen the scope of agent's release.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER(SA ALBERT P. CLARK) BY
SSC_STAFF MEMBER

On ‘August 13, 1975, former Special Agent Albert P.
Clark, who was a supervisor in the San Francisco FBI Office
and who retired in December of 1969, advised as follows:

He was interviewed in his home at 66 Elm,
Larkspur, California, by SSC Member Lester B. Seidel from
5:40 P.M. to 6:55 P.M., August 12, 1975.

Clark was not placed under oath and no mention
was made of his rights. However, Seidel was pleasant and
‘in no way antagonistic. The interview was general, not
penetrative, not in depth, and very few specific questions were
asked. There appeared to be no discernible criticism of
either the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) or the
Bureau's investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) by
Seidel.

Seidel was compelled on more than one occasion
to declare that he was pro-FBI, that the object of his .
inquiries was to assist the United States Senate in under-
standing the problem in order that they could consider
possible legislation that may eliminate any abuses in the
future.

Seidel did mention the fact several tines that

information had been leaked to the press that Jané'Seberg,
“the movie actress, had become pregnant by a BPP official.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY

Seidel finally asked Clark if he would have okayed
a COINTEL proposal like this and he answered that he would
have if he felt that it would have sufficiently hindered
the BPP, stating that possibly in some of these occasions
someone might get hurt but on the other hand, investigation
of the BPP by the FBI might be made easier and it might
also cut down on the number of BPP supporters.

Clark was asked to whom the main BPP case was
assigned and to whom COINTEL had been assigned in the San
Francisco Division. Clark replied that he did not remember
but possibly during the time of his supervision, more than
one Agent -had handled the matters.

Seidel asked how many BPP informants the San
Francisco Division had. Clark replied he did not recall
Bad= he did not believe that Seidel had a right to know.

Seidel inquired about the BPP wiretap, asking
who had requested the tap, the Bureau or the San Francisco
Division. Again, Clark replied that he did not recall but
the San Francisco Division would not have necessarily
waited for the Bureau to initiate the matter but might have
requested the Bureau rather than bain Bureau having initiated
the matter.

Seidel wanted to have an example of a COINTEL
proposal. He was not given a specific example but general
conversation was had to the effect that any move that might
be suggested that would aid the San Francisco Division in
their investigation of the BPP in determining their
supporters and financiers and possibly disenchanting those
individuals might be an example.

Seidel did not’ ask Clark whether he had done a
particular thing.

Questioned concerning whether he felt COINTEL had ©
been effective, Clark replied he did not believe the matter
was susceptible to proof but the BPP had sure gone into a
steep decline.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel again brought up the Seberg matter and
asked if it had done any good. Clark stated he replied,
"Maybe."

During this conversation, Clark got the general
impression that’ perhaps Seidel did not feel that COINTEL
had been necessary but Clark had argued that it had made
the BPP more difficult to operate and possibly easier
for the FBI to investigate.

Seidel then wanted to know what there was about
the BPP that caused such a concentration of FBI investi-
gative attention. Clark pointed out that this would have
to be answered in the context of time, that at the time the
program was initiated, there was no doubt that the BPP
was a violent, racist organization opposing all law enforce-
ment, attacking officers and generally disturbing —
tranquility of the community.

Seidel then went on to discuss the business of
pressure. Had Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates
and the Bureau put too much pressure on the matter? Clark
stated there was undoubtedly pressure because everyone
was interested in doing the best type job possible and
finding cut everything possible concerning the BPP. There
was obvious pressure from the Bureau in the matter and the
Bureau, in a case like this, could never be satisfied.
Clark stated that he related that perhaps too much
pressure had come from the Bureau because he had felt at
the time he was a supervisor that San Francisco Division
knew more about the BPP than the Bureau. On the other
hand, he related that Bureau officials were probably
under pressure because of the national interest and the
demands on them in Washington.

: Seidel related that he was interested in ascer-
taining what Agent would make the best witness to appear
in Washington to explain and testify concerning COINTEL.
He specifically requested Clark's recommendation and mentioned
the names of Special Agents Leo S. Brenneisen of San
Francisco and Bob Baker of Los Angeles. Clark stated that
he had countered by suggesting that somebody in Washington
who directed the program and approved all proposals might
be a. better witness.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

Clark recalled that near the first of the inter-
view, Seidel probably, more to make conversation than to
obtain information, asked a few guestions concerning US "
and the Republic of North Africa (RNA). He was advised
that US had not been active in this division and there had
been no pertinent RNA activity brought to his attention.
Seidel asked if Ron Karenga of US had visited San Francisco
and. Clark replied he had no exact recollection of this.

Seidel talked and asked Clark's opinion on'the
separation into different agencies of the Bureau's criminal
and security investigations. Clark stated that he told
Seidel that in the past he had considered this and felt that
frankly it might have advantages, and at the same time,
might have disadvantages. He pointed out that the
disadvantages .were that you could not be sure that it, in
fact, would work and that if you remove the security
investigations from the Bureau, you wouid undoubtedly
lose a great deal, including public support.

Seidel asked if Clark had worked under former
SAC Harry Morgan. He advised that he had retired prior to
the time Morgan was assigned to the San Francisco Division.

Clark pointed out that during the interview, a
recorder appeared prominently on his desk, and Seidel
could, of course, not be sure that it was not in operation,
although as the duration of the interview lengthened, it
must have been obvious to Seidel that it was not operating.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER (SA WILLIAM A. COHENDE BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

. On August 14, 1975, retired former Special Agent:
William A. Cohendet was interviewed from 9:30 A.M. to
11:15 A.M. by Lester B. Seidel, Investigator for the U.S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activitds* (SSC).

The interview took place at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness
Avenue, San Francisco.

Mr. Seidel mentioned that he was serving as a
counsel for the SSC, investigating all phases of the United
States intelligence community, and he had chosen the Black
Panther Party and the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL}
as his field. He stated that he was hoping for full
cooperation on the part of the former Special Agent.

He was advised that former Special Agent Cohendet
was willing to cooperate with the committee and he trusted
that something constructive would come out of the effort
being put forward. Former Special Agent Cohendet also
pointed out that in his opinion the Black Panther Party (BPP)
had been a group devoted to violence, thievery, and fraud,
and the committee should realize the type of Subjects with |
whom they are dealing in order to place the investigation
in its proper framework.

The first question concerned the former Special
Agent's background and Bureau service. This was briefly
furnished.

Seidel then asked when and how the technical
surveillances had been installed, who initiated them, and
-who approved them.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to

‘your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed

SSC_STAFF MEMBER

The former Special Agent replied that he was
not party to any of these arrangements and did not know
any of the details.

Seidel then asked if former Special Agent
Cohendet knew the origin and purposes of the COINTEL
Program. He was informed that the former Agent did not
know the origin of the program, and said he believed’its
purposes were those as set forth in the instructions: which
Seidel had and which spoke for themselves. The former
Agent admitted that said program at one time had been

~~,-~assigned to him but due. to the press of other functions,

Nw 55160

he had been unable to give it a great deal of time and
felt that during the period that it had been assigned to
him, it had been largely ineffective.

Seidel then asked if there was any connection
between ELSUR and COINTEL and the reply was given that
obviously there would be if the ELSUR material being
reviewed could be considered as having any pertinence to
a COINTEL operation. However, former Special Agent Cohendet
could not recall having used this material while the case
was assigned to him, at least to any significant degree.

Not having the files available made it impossible to
state positively if there had been any specific instance of
of this material. 7

Seidel asked as to the possible effectiveness of
anonymous letters and he was informed that in the opinion
of the former Agent, such letters, particularly having to
do with personal infidelity or thievery, which were the
usual suggested avenues, would have little effect on the

- recipients who were active in such fields themselves much

of the time. In the more serious areas of perhaps trying
to falsely show that an individual was an FBI or police
informant, the former Special Agent said that the use of
this technique would not be used for fear of causing bodily
harm or death to an innocent person due to the well-known
propensity of the BPP of dealing harshly with any suspected
deviator let alone informant. .

Seidel then asked as to the value of ELSUR to
the BPP investigation and the former Special Agent stated
that in his belief it was extremely valuable in many ways.
For instance, it assisted and gauged the true Huey Newton,
his plans, and weaknesses. It was also valuable in esti-

. mating the possible effect of a certain COINTEL program

| NW 55160

as possibly suggested by some other office. As a result
of their information, the San Francisco Office usually
rejected most suggestions as being unlikely to be successful.

Seidel wondered if ELSUR was not the most
valuable, single investigative aid that the Bureau had had
in this investigation, and the former Special Agent agreed
that he was probably correct.

Seidel then wondered if the COINTEL proposals
should be part of some legislation proposed by Congress
and the former Special Agent replied that the Bureau
officials, in his opinion, should be allowed to comment
on this because the fact that the program would be ineffective
against the BPP might not be a valid argument that it would
not work to better advantage in other circumstances.

Former Special Agent Cohendet declined to
comment on the effectiveness of COINTEL as used against
the Socialist Workers Party, not having had any experience
with its use in that field.

Seidel then asked about informants and asked if
there had been any pressure from the Bureau in the develop-
ment of such sources. Former Special Agent Cohendet
acknowledged that there certainly had been great pressure
in this direction, as it was well known that informants were
a necessary part of any investigation and a policé organi-
zation can never give up on this phase of its work no matter
how @ifficult the circumstances were in their development.
In the case of the BPP, the development of informants was
particularly difficult because of the fear that many persons
in the ‘black community felt concerning the BPP as weil as
the lack of desire to cooperate against another black
person.

Seidel asked about foreign funds being raised
and given to the BPP, and former Special Agent Cohendet
recalled that "Masai" Hewitt and others went to. Sweden
and other countries where the BPP raised money on speech
making tours.

i Seidel then asked about any investigation of

t BPP funds and former Special Agent Cohendet said that it
was his recollection that investigation of BPP funds had
been undertaken through legal channels but he had no
personal knowledge of the investigation and declined to
go further into this field.

Seidel asked about referrals of Bureau information
to the Internal Revenue Service and former Special Agent
Cohendet said that he had no personal knowledge of what
had been done in this direction.

Seidel then asked about the affair between
Actress Jean Seberg and "Masai" Hewitt, which had appeared
in a Hollywood gossip column and had alleged that Seberg
had become pregnant by Hewitt. Seidel said that the Los
Angeles Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
admitted leaking this information to someone in the press.

Former Special Agent Cohendet knew that this
couple had been lovers for a brief period but denied any
knowledge of any leak to the press by either San Francisco
or Los Angeles.

fl Seidel asked if the former Agent thought that
leaking this type of information was appropriate. No
comment was offered as to this question.

Seidel, at the conclusion of the interview, said
that he had noted that the “faking" of police records as
suggested had never been undertaken and he observed that he
believed the COINTEL abuses were being overplayed by the
press. From what he learned in interviews in San Francisco,
it seemed to him that the program had been mostly played
down and indeed, an independent judgment had been exercised
in the implementation of the program.

A general discussion of the BPP ensued in which
former Special Agent Cohendet reiterated the criminal
background and threatening attitude of many of the BPP
members, their mendacious ways, and their lack of credi-

. bility in their public statements. The former Special
Agent credited ‘the news media with helping to build up
the BPP beyond its actual strength-and influence.

Seidel asked about the former Agent's knowledge of the reason
for the removal of former SAC Harry Morgan from San
Francisco. He said the only reason he was asking this
question was in order to avoid embarrassing former SAC
Morgan when he interviews him concerning his possible
knowledge of, BPP activities sometime in the future. Former
Special Agent Cohendet had no knowledge as to why
Mr. Morgan was transferred.

In summation, Seidel ventured the opinion that he
thought the ELSUR technique was far moré valuable in the
carrying out of the investigation of the BPP than the
COINTEL. Former Special Agent Cohendet had to agree
to the above observation.

Former Special Agent Cohendet was not advised
of any rights that he might have in declining to answer
any questions and Seidel said he was actually seeking
witnesses for a possible hearing in Washington, D.C. He
stated that no names would be mentioned in any write-up
he would make concerning his interviews.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER (SA DAVID E. TODD
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 12, 1975, retired former SA David E. Todd
was interviewed from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. by Lester B. Seidel,
Investigator for the SSC. The interview took place at the
Holiday Inn, San Francisco.

By way of background, in all contacts with Seidel
previously, former SA Todd has indicated to him great reluctance
to discuss these matters without clearance from the Bureau,
and pointed out to Seidel that the Bureau had released former
SA Todd from the Employment Secrecy Agreement for the purpose
of a staff interview, but Seidel was told that former SA Todd
did not think it was either his responsibility or his prerogative
to provide information or make information public; that while
employed he was acting as an Agent of the Federal Government
and felt it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to
provide the information, and that if the Senate Committee
desired information from former SA Todd, the questions should

“have been submitted to him in writing, and his answers should

have been made in writing and first forwarded to the FBI, and

‘then after the FBI determined it advisable to make these answers

available to the Committee, that would have been the proper
channel. .

Seidel pointed out the Committee and the Bureau had
made an agreement whereby the Bureau would make Agents available
to the Committee for interview. Former SA Todd pointed ott to
Seidel that he is not in the category of an Agent, being a
retired Agent, and at this point there was no additional discussion
on this matter.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions’ of
the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your
agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed outside
your agency.

Seidel was also told that nothing that was said by
former SA Todd should be interpreted as being critical of
the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) itself, and that if
the Bureau felt that such a Program was necessary in the interest
of national defense, he had carried it out in the best way he
saw fit, and that in recommending against specific proposals
as being impractical or inadvisable, these recommendations were
against the specific incidents recommended and not against the
Program as a whole.

Seidel's first questions dealt with former SA Todd's
background and the extent of his Bureau service, and whether
he had worked security or criminal matters. Former SA Todd
gave him chronologically the offices in which he had served
in the Bureau, and stated he had been associated from 1952 to
1956 with the Domestic Intelligence Division, Washington, D.C.,
and had become Supervisor in San Francisco in December, 1969,
of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and that during his Bureau
career he had worked both criminal and security matters.

Seidel asked the name of the squad which was originally
the Racial Squad, and subsequently changed to Extremist Matters,
and he asked whether the work was strictly intelligence, or
whether it combined intelligence or criminal work. It was
pointed out Bombing Matters were originally being handled on
this Squad for a period of time, and that both the criminal
activities of the Panthers, as well-.as intelligence activities,
were combined in the assignment.

: Seidel then asked when the technical surveillances on
the Panthers were installed. Former SA Todd replied that they
were functioning at the time he was appointed Supervisor. Seidel
then asked how was the technical surveillance related to the
COINTEL, if at all, and specifically whether information coming
from the technical surveillance was used in carrying out the
COINTEL. Former SA Todd advised that he Could not recall
specifically what was done in either Program without reviewing
the files and comparing the information therein with the source.
Seidel seemed very interested in this, but actually the question
could not be answered on the basis of recollection alone, and
was not.

Seidel then asked how would the Panther COINTEL
be defined with regard to aims, techniques and results. The
answer to this was that the aims were to counter generally the
revolutionary objectives and activities of the Panthers. The
question concerning techniques was left unanswered, and as
far as results go, former SA Todd told Seidel that he did not
feel there had been any great results from the Program as it was
pursued in the San Francisco Office, but he could not speak
for the rest of the Program as far as the Bureau is concerned.

Seidel asked whether the Agents working the criminal
aspects of the BPP received information that was received from
a technical source, and he was told procedures by which
information had been routed to them in their cases, and that at
the time we operated these technical surveillances, we felt they
had been installed lawfully, and that the information received
could be used.

Seidel asked whether there was a great deal of pressure
put on the San Francisco Office for the development of informants.
He was told yes, that informants were the backbone of good law
enforcement and the Bureau constantly urged better informant
coverage.

Seidel asked if there had been similar pressure placed
on the office in the COINTEL, and former SA Todd replied that
ba he did not feel that any great pressure had been put on the
office to carry out this Program, but that the Bureau had recom-
mended the Program, however, had left it up to the office
pretty much as to how it should be carried out.

i a Seidel asked whether the Program had been successful
| in causing dissen¥ion within the Party. Former SA Todd told
him that he did not feel this had been particularly effective
in any way, and that causing dissenZion had not been a primary
objective of the Program in the San Francisco Office, and that
the policy had been to use the Program for primarily two
purposes: 1) for the purpose of developing informants by.
attempting to dissuade them from their loyalties to the Party;
and 2) to make representations to Panthers for whom outstanding
arrest warrants had been issued in order to flush them out so
they could be apprehended.

Seidel asked specifically about the COINTEL involving
the Breakfast Program, and was told a recommendation had been
made for putting some kind of .contamination in the Breakfast
Program food, and that this office had felt this extremely
inadvisable and recommended against it, and it was not carried
out here.

Former SA Todd was also asked about a COINTEL
proposal relating to "The Black Panther" newspapers, and was
told that such a proposal had been made involving saturating
the papers with a foul smelling fish oil or some substance,
however, we recommended against this as it would serve no purpose.

Seidel was advised that the San Francisco policy had
been to recommend against harassment, per se, and also recommended
against leaking information to the press. Seidel then raised
the question about the incident where Huey P. Newton's high
standard of living was given to the press, and he was told
that this fell into the category of informant development on
the basis it was felt that if those Panthers who were living
practically in poverty could realize what Newton's standards
of living were, it might change their allegignce to him and
they could be contacted for informant purposes.

Seidel was also told that in this phase of the
COINTEL, it was former SA Todd's recollection that this infor-
a mation regarding Newton's high standard of living had been
disseminated by informants, and that the press was well aware
of Newton's standards of living without having to make this
information available to them.

2 Seidel asked what the instructions had been from the
Bureau in carring out the COINTEL. Former SA Todd told Seidel
that he had reviewed this file after being appointed Supervisor,
but could not recall -specifically what the Bureau instructions
were. The only other instructions: received were at a two day
conférence in Washington, D.C., on BPP matters conducted by
former Assistant to the Director William Sullivan, and Section
Chief George Moore, at which time it was pointed out that the
Bureau desired the COINTEL to be coordinated with the Bureau,
but that former SA Todd did not recall any firm prohibition against

taking certain actions without Bureau authority, and that the
field had some leeway in what they did, but, in general, offices
made proposals to the Bureau with copies to San Francisco

prior to taking any action. Seidel asked why San Francisco

got copies of all proposals, and was told this was because

San Francisco was office of origin in the BPP case and other
offices were required to furnish a copy of all correspondence.

Seidel then asked to what extent Special Agent in
Charge Charles W. Bates had knowledge of the COINTEL as it
related to the BPP, and he was told that former SA Todd could
not speak for Bates and his knowledge ‘would be dependent upon
how carefully he read incoming mail and reviewed files, and
former SA Todd had no knowledge as to what extent Bates did this.

Seidel was told that under the supervisory setup in the
office at the time, former SA Todd felt it was his responsibility
to direct this Program in San Francisco and not Bates.

Seidel indicated that out of his investigation in the
hearings, undoubtedly there would be some legislation coming
out of Congress that would either enable or prohibit such
things as the COINTEL, and he stated that was one reason he
was asking concerning its effectiveness, and wondered what former
SA Todd would recommend. Seidel was told that former SA Todd
felt it essential that the Government should have the right to

- defend itself against individuals and groups who advocate

r violent revolution or who are aligned with foreign powers,

and that there was a need for some sort of legislation within
the framework of constitutional government which would enable
the §évernment to do this; but, of course, it should be done
under.proper control. Seidel asked for suggestions as to what
sort of control, and was told that this was a matter for
Congress to decide, but perhaps Congress should look into some
legislation similar to wiretap legislation, where the responsi-
bility is upon a Federal judge to issue a warrant.

Former SA Todd had prepared a brief summary of what
he recalled of the activities of the BPP, and he made a copy of
this available to Seidel. Former SA Todd also had made a
chronology to assist him in answering questions, together with

some notes concerning COINTEL policy, former SA Todd's general
recollection of matters, questions’ of law regarding agent -
princip3@! privileged information problems, ongoing litigation
and national defense, and informants and sources. Seidel asked
for a copy of this chronology and this, too, was given to him.

Seidel expressed great interest in receiving the one
page summary of the Panthers' activities, and statéd that he
had chosen the Panthers for a case study, and he seemed more
interested in this than in the COINTEL. He also indicated that
there might be future interviews and that former SA Todd might
be called as a witness before the Committee at a later date.

At the outset of the interview, Seidel asked whether
former SA Todd desired his rights be read to him. Former
SA Todd told him that since he did not interpret this as a
custodial interview, and it was his understanding Seidel had no
police power, that he could forego reading the rights.

Former SA Todd did not feel it was necessary to
consult with a Bureau representative at this time.

The above information was furnished by former SA Todd
voluntarily and was not solicited.

i The oe of the Black Panther @.:; was a
.National.Defense matter. Information on file points to colla-~
boration with foreign powers by leaders of the Party,

wa

Throughout the two-year period in which I supervised
the investigation there were strong liaisons between Black Panthers
and dissident groups abroad a5 well as with the governments of
foreign nations. The Black Panthers had support and/or branches
in France, Germany and Scandinavia, and were international in
scope. Eldridge Cleaver, wanted on felony warrants, had been
granted asylum in Algeria and with his entourage was residing
in a villa provided by the Algerian government, During this
period he made at least one trip to- Moscow, Russia, Several
Black Panthers travelled to Cuba, Huey Newton, in 1971, travelled
to Red China by way of Canada and Hong Kong at the invitation ’
of the Chinese government at a time when the United States had
no di cpifratic relations with them,

: At the time I began serving as supervisor in late 1969,
the Black Panther Party was under co~leadership of Huey Newton,
then confined to prison in California, and Eldridge Cleaver, living
in exile in Algeria. The Black Panther Party, both in the news.
paper it published weekly at San Francisco, and in public statements
by its officers and leaders, advocated violent revolution; it
published instructions on guerrilla warfare, directions for the use
of weapons, and printed detailed drawings and instructions on
the manufecture of bombs and explosive devices, and it agitated
ovenly for the aurder of police officers, The term "off the
pigs," waich means "kill the police," was a Black Panther catch»
phrase, The history of the Black Panther Party during the period
I acted as supervisor is replete with incidents of murder, violence
and inciting to revolution, The revolutionary quotation of Mao-
Tse-Tung, “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,"
became a Black Panther motto,
Sometime in early 1971 a split occurred in the Black
| Panther.Party, Huey Newton, following his release from prison
| 4n 1970, gained control of one faction headquartered in Berkeley,
| California, and he broke openly with Zldridge Cleaver, publicly
expelling Cleaver and Cleaver's lieutenents from the Party. The -
Newton faction thereafter gradually took a more moderate approach,
" advocating social change through community service in place of its
prior profile of violence, No change was noted in the policies of
the Cleaver faction directed from Algiers, and it continued to
advocate violent revolution; it began publication in New York
of its own newspaper proclaiming itsrevolutionary policies; and
followers belonging to this faction continued to commit crimes of
violence, :

The following crimes of violence attributed to the Cleaver
faction of the Black Panthers have been documented in the. book "Target
Blue," by former Deputy Police Commissioner Robert Daley of New York
City (Dell Publishing Co., Ine., 1973):

: _ Ambush attacks egainst police officers which resulted in .
7 officers murdered, 3 wounded, and one attempted murder thwarted, which
led to the solution of the other cases and established these attacks Hi
to be a nationwide conspiracy; and the murder of two Newton-faction

Question

(3) if not, please explain.

(4) if so, does the FBI assert that
the same assumption of continuing
intelligence investigations would
apply to individuals or groups
lacking the same or similar proven
violent background?

(5) if yes, please explain both in
general and with specific reference
to any support provided by the
Coyne letter.

Who, if anyone, has disputed that “such
matters as domestic terrorism certainly
affect the internal security and
national welfare * * *,"?

How was the armed attack on the

President (Truman?) connected with the

Coyne letter?

-4

With reference to page 1 of the

report to the NSC dated Mar. 5, 1954:

(1) Does an overall reading of this
page reasonably convey the impres-
sion that program objectives were
designed to protect against sub-
version by domestic groups that
might be directed, or controlled

. by a foreign power?

(2) If yes, and since "the LIC members
recognize their responsibility as
assigned by the Directives * * *",
does this mean that the Directives
apply to only such domestic groups
and the members recognized this |
limitation? If not, please explain,

(3) If ACI) is no, please explain
giving specific consideration to
the necessity for the first 3
paragraphs on the page and the
need to integrate domestic and
foreign intelligence.(See goal 1.)

Do Mr. Hoover's Nov. 6, 1958 comments
concerning the usurpation of jurisdic-
tion from local authorities indicate
his belief that the FBI was not

Question

and order throughout the country?

Was it ever the FBI's position that it
was not and/or did not desire to be a
national police?

Is crime prevention through the gathering
of intelligence a police function?

I£ not, please explain. :

T£ yes, how do the FBI's domestic intelli-
gence gathering activities differ from
the usual police function? :

If there is no substantive difference,
does this mean the FBI, in the area of
domestic intelligence gathering, now con-
stitutes and performs as a national
police force?

If not, please explain.

Is the Emergency Detention Law (EML) the
same as Subchapter II of the Internal
Security Act of 1950? (ISA)?

Mr. Hoover's testimony (Emergency Supple-

mental Appropriations Bill, 1940, at

304) indicates that thé FBI maintained a

list or index of subversive individuals

prior to the enactment of the ISA:

(1) What did the FBI call this list or
index?

(2) Did the list contain the names or
individuals whether or not potentiall
dangerous?

Did the EML/ISA specifically require the

FBI to maintain a list of potentially

dangerous subversives?

(1) If so, how did the EML/ISA list
differ from the subversive list
already being maintained by the FBI?

(2) If there were differences between
the two lists, what criteria was
used to determine whether to list
an individual on the EML/ISA index?

(3) If there were no significant
differences between the lists, why
was the EML/ISA list necessary aside
from any statutory requirement?

Question

When and under what authority was Sub-
chapter II of the ISA repealed?
Identify the specific criminal statutes
covering acts of expionage or sabotage?
Did the ISA ever provide for the emer-
gency detention of individuals who might
possibly commit, or conspire to commit,
acts other than espionage or sabotage?

(1)
(2)

(3)

If so, please identify such other
acts.

If not, did the EML/ISA list ever
contain the names of individuals
who might engage in subversive

‘ activities other than expionage or

sabotage? -
If so, what authority permitted
their inclusion on the EML/ISA list?

Is the Domestic Intelligence Division
mentioned in Mr. Hoover's memorandum of
May 11, 1961, an FBI or DOJ division?

Besides the memorandum of Attorney
General Clark, dated Sept. 14, 1967, con-
cerning urban riot activity:

(1)

(2)
(3)

(4)

How many other specific case-by-case
instructions regarding domestic
intelligence investigative matters
have been received from the Attorney
General or DOJ?

When were such instructions received?
What were the subject matter of the
instructions?

Please provide copies of such
instructions.

"x & & the FBI gradually came to be
assigned intelligence investigations out-
side the foreign controlled espionage and
sabotage matters * * #";

(1)

Does this sentence mean that initial}
the FBI had authority to only conduct!
intelligence operations of those
domestic organizations or individuals
that were controlled by or connected
with a foreign power and could

- possible be used for espionage’ or

sabotage?

Question

(2) Ef not, please explain.

(3) If so, what document (describe
and give date) enlarged the FBI's
authority so that it could conduct
investigations regarding "other
intelligence matters affecting
the internal security * * *,".

Does 28 U.S.C. 533(1) provide the
statutory basis for the FBI's investi-
gation of criminal violations in the
internal security area?

If not, what is the statute that
provides such authority?

Exactly when did the FBI begin to use
its statutory authority to conduct
criminal investigations as a basis for
its domestic intelligence operations?

Does the FBI view Attorney General

Clark's Sept. 14, 1967 memorandum as

a directive to:

(1) Provide information of possible
criminal violations resulting
from riots that had already
occurred, or

(2) Engage in a continuing intelligence
operations with respect to black
nationalist groups, or

(3) Engage in continuing intelligence
operations with respect to any
extremist group or individual?

If none of the above, what is the

import of the memorandum? ~

Did this memorandum constitute additional

authority for the FBI to conduct domesti

intelligence investigations?

If so, what additional authority in

this area is conveyed to the FBI?

Does the FBI view the Feb. 18, 1969
DOJ memorandum as constituting any
additional authority for the FBI to
engage in domestic intelligence
investigations?

Question

If so, what additional authority .in this
area is conveyed to the FBI?

The "President's proclamation" mentioned

by Mr. Hoover on Nov. 30, 1939, during

his testimony on the Emergency Supple-

mental Appropriations Bill, 1940, at 304:

(1) Is the "President's proclamation"
the Sept. 6, 1939 Presidential
Directive? —

(2) If not, to what does "President's
proclamation" refer? Please provide
copy if not already provided.

What were the "national defense statutes"

referred to in Mr. Hoover's testimony,

supra?
In his testimony, supra, did Mr. Hoover

"subversive activities * * * or any
activities that are possibly detrimental
to the internal security of the United
States"?

If so, please provide copy of such
testimony.

If not, how could Congress at that time
know or appreciate what the FBI was
actually doing in the area of domestic
intelligence investigations.

During Mr. Hoover's testimony on Jan. 5,
1940, on the Justice Department Appro-
priations Bill, 1940, at 153, did Mr.
Hoover ever explain what constituted
“being active in any subversive activity
or in movements detrimental to the
internal security"?

If so, please provide copy of such
testimony’

If not, how could Congress at that time,
know or appreciate in detail what the
FBI was doing in the area of domestic
intelligence investigations?

Mr. Hoover's testimony of June 6, 1940 on
the Supplemental National Defense Appro-
priation, 1941, at 180, mentions a
National Defense Division. Is this the
successor division to the Intelligence
Division mentioned in Mr. Hoover's testi-
mony of Jan. 5, 1940, at 153?

Question

Mr. Hoover also mentions at 181, that
the general intelligence index included
the names of such persons as "known espio-
nage agents, known saboteprs, leading
members of the Communist party, and the
bund."

(1) Can it be reasonably concluded that
this listing reflects what. the FBI,
at that time, considered its intelli-]
gence investigation authority under
the Presidential Directives to be,
i.e., limited solely to espionage
and sabotage matters, and domestic
groups connected with foreign
governments?

If not, please explain.

If other types of groups or individ=
uals were included in the index,
please describe their activities.

If other groups or individuals were
included in the general index but
-not-mentioned in the testimony,
could Congress be fully apprised of
of the scope of the FBI's intelli-
gence investigation activities at
that time?

If so, please explain.

(2)

(4)

(5)

Does the FBI believe that Congress has,
by receiving testimony about the FBI's
domestic intelligence activities as well
as intelligence information, recognized
the scope of FBI domestic intelligence
activities and tacitly approved of those
activities?

If not, please explain.

If so, does the FBI consider this tacit
approval to be an additional authority
to conduct domestic intelligence
activities?

If not, please explain.

Is it the FBI's position that, aside

with various criminal statutes, authorizes|
the FBI to infiltrate groups or other-
wise engage in affirmative, active

to the commitment or alleged commitment
of a violation of one of the criminal

If not, please explain.

If so, what language in 28 U.S.C. 533,

Question

Besides the Sept. 14, 1967 instructions

from the Attorney General and the Feb. 18,

1969 instructions from the Assistant Attorney

General, Internal Security Division, has

the Department of Justice (DOJ) provided

any other instructions or directives,

applicable to a general situation rather

than a specific group or individual, that
pertain to FBI domestic intelligence
investigations?

If so, please provide copies of such

instructions and directives.

If not:

(1) In what manner were these two instruc-
tions amplified by other policy
instructions?

(2) Were policy instructions pertaining to
specific cases ever used by the FBI as
guidance for a policy in a more general-
ized situation where no pertinent instrud
tions had been received from the Attorney
General or DOJ?

(3) I£ so, please list the areas where this
was done and provide pertinent docu-
mentation.

(4) The parenthetical information suggests
that besides the above mentioned dated
memoranda other policy instructions
were received and not all of these
concerned specific cases.

(1) Is this correct?
(2) If so, please explain if question AJ
above, was answered in the negative

for the FBI to query DOJ about the
propriety of maintaining a list similar

_What authority exists for defining

MANUAL SECTION 87: INVESTIGATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATIONS

Question

FBI investigations under Section 87
are based on statutes and Departmental
Directives. ;
(1) Does this mean that no authority
was conferred on the FBI by the
various Presidential Directives?
(2) I£ so, please explain in view of
the position taken by Messrs.
Wannall, Watters and Lacey that
intelligence investigative
authority was delegated to the FB
by Presidential Directives in
addition to statutory jurisdictior|
(3) If Presidential Directives did
delegate authority to FBI, why
aren't the Directives cited as
authority for investigations.
What are the Department instructions
to which reference is made?
Are these the same Department instruc-
tions mentioned in Section 122,
paragraph Ala, page 1? If not, what
are these instructions?

What considerations affect the
"desirability" of conducting an
investigation of possible statutory
violations discovered during the
course of an investigation of sub-
versives?

Would these same criteria apply to
possible violations discovered in
the course of extremist investigations
(see Section 122, paragraph Alc,
page la.)?

If not, please explain.

“subversive activities" in the
manner set forth?

Since specific statutes provide the
basis for FBI investigations and
since a preliminary inquiry can be

Question

conducted for 90 days without a
specific indication of the statutory
basis for the authority:

(1) Please explain how statutory
authority exists for such a
preliminary inquiry during the
90 day period.

(2) Does such a procedure mean that
a contact.of unknown nature
between an individual and a
subversive group is sufficient
in itself to constitute an
activity "which may result in a
violation" of some statute even
if the statute is not specified?

EXTREMIST MATTERS AND CIVIL: UNREST

Paragraph

la

1d

Question

What is the purpose of the Manual?

Please identify the "Departmental
instructions" and provide copies of
same if not already provided.

As regards 18 U.S.C. $8241, 2383,
2384, 2385, are attempts and con-
spiracies encompassed by the phrase
“activities which may result in a

violation * * *'"?

(1) If not, what activities does
the phrase encompass?

(2) I£ so, what other activities
(describe generally) are
covered by the phrase?

(3) Where conspiracy is itself the

crime (see 18 U.S.C. §8241,
2384 and 2385), what activities
are covered by the phrase?

Is the import of the first sentence

that:
(1)

The various Presidential
Directives charged the FBI with
only responsibility for the
collection and coordination of
internal security information?

(2) This coordination and collection
responsibility was passive
in nature, not requiring active
investigations?

(3) No intelligence investigative
authority was conveyed to the
FBI by the Presidential Direc-
tives?

If A(1) is no:

(1) What is meant?

(2) Why does the third sentence

state that there is a difference
between the FBI's collection

and coordination responsibility
and its "jurisdictional authorit
for conducting active investi- ©
gations" under various statutes.

Question

If A(2) is no, why does the third
sentence emphasize that the authority |
for "active investigations" is
derived from statutes and Departmental
Directives?
If the Directives did convey authority,
(1) What is the difference between
a "responsibility" as in
“responsibility to coordinate .
and collect" and "authority"
as in "jurisdictional authority"4
(2) Why does paragraph Ala of
Section 122, at page 1, not
mention the Presidential Direc-
tives’ as authority for investi-
gations?
If AC1),(2),(3), or any one of them
is answered yes, how can such an
answer be reconciled with the positioy
found in the papers by Messrs. Wannall
Watters and Lacey that the FBI was
delegated authority to conduct active
intelligence investigations by
various Presidential Directives both
oral and written?

What is the authority for defining
“extremist activities" in the manner
set out?

How do -"extremist activities" as
defined differ from "subversive
activities" as defined in Manual ”
Section 87, paragraph A4, page 4?
If the definitions are the same or
substantially the same, why is a
distinction between extremists and
subversives necessary?

What is a characterization of an
individual or organization?

Please list all indices at both
FBI headquarters and field office
levels on which extremist individuals

may be listed in addition to the

ADEX and EPA,
