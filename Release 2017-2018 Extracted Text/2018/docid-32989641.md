SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

With respect to the excision of the material being

delivered herewith, appropriate notations appear where

the excisions concern the protection of an Informant or a

peculiarly sensitive foreign intelligence operation. All

other excisions pertain to portions which actually summarize

or quote from conversations monitored during electronic

surveillance of Dr.

• King.

In most cases, it can be ascertained

precisely which information in FBI files came from electronic

surveillances of Dr. King; however, there exist areas where

documentation of the information is not

precise and no

accurate determinetion can be made.

Therefore,

no assurances

can be given that portions of the material being furnished

do not contain information developed as a result of electronic

surveillances

of. Dr. King.

In connection with any response where we have

included Xeroxes of newspaper articles or news releases, we

have not

necessarily furnished all relating to a particular

matter which may be scattered throughout FBI files, but have

included those readily

available and generally representative

of the media accounts of the particular matter.

An example,

would be those included in the response to Item 7 of the

July 8, 1975, SSC request:

The remaining materials in the SSC requests of July 8.

and 14, 1975, and August 20, 1975, (Part VII) are receiving

continuous attention and the results will be forwarded on

"a periodic basis as soon as possible.

that time we have delivered all material relating to the "Hunter"

project which was a mail surveillance by CIA. The LEM enclosed

with our letter to the Attorney General contains additional

responses concerning eight mail surveys involving interception

and opening of mail by the FBI. It is noted that SSC request

for names of all individuals who participated in mail openings

is not being complied with.

They are being told we do

have such a list available although it is not considered

complete.

We feel access to such a list by SSC staff at this

time should be specifically authorized by the Department.

Re:

heading of the FBI code name for each such survey.

Due to the

nature of the records maintained for each of these surveys, you

will note that the amount of information furnished may vary

considerably from survey to survey.

For instance, an appreciable

volume of Material: and detail has beon developed concerning the

so-called Sam Survey since a control file was maintained and

the operacion was conducted over an approximate seven-year

period, primarily in new York, bug tien some acciutty occurring

in several other field divisions. le sun Survey on the othere

nana, was a much more narrow operacion conducted only in New York

for a one-year period, No control file or documentation was

locatod for thie progran.

With

respect to the request for the names of individuals

who participated in the programe listed, retrievability of this

information also presented a problem.

FBI Headquarters" racords

were not neipful in this area. By canvassing appropriate field

alvisions, we have been able to reconstruct a partial list of

such individuals. However, the nature of, those recoras

are

such that the list cannot be coneidered complete.

In view of

this, and since mail surveillance by the FBI is the subject of

an on-going Investigation by the Department of Justice,

involving natters' which may invite sanctions of a criminal

nature, a llat Is not being included in this response.

At the

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney

General of the United States, pursuant to Executive Order

"The Daily World," an East Coast Communist News-

paper, in its issue dated March 17, 1970, contained an article

concerning a discussion of the Philadelphia Social Science

Forum held at the Hotel Philadelphia,

Philadelphia, Pa.

The

topic of the discussion was the Women's Struggle for Libera-

tion.

Among the speakers was one MARYMC CAlle who identified

herself as from "Women's Liberation.

tion, carried an,

tablishment of Women's Liberation Center at 928 chestnut

The District Committee of the Communist Party (CP)

of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware met in Philadelphia on

August 9, 1970. At that meeting an announcement was made that

the CP would have a table at the rally of the Women's Libera-

tion group to be held in Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia on

August 26, 1970. It was stated at this meeting that the CE

had been invited to participate in the women's Liberation Move-

SOREITOUS was

formerly a member of National

because of dissension among

its members.

While a member of NOW she reportedly met MAREEN

JASON who went with SOKEITOUS into the new organization,

POWER. JASON arranged for POWER to use the telephone number

and address of 928 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, as a

telephone listing and a mailing address.

"New Mobe"

also

has an address at 928 Chestnut Street and JASON arranged for

that organization to do the printing for POWER at a reduced

rate.

SOKEITOUS and others began organizing immediately

for a Women's Rights Day rally to be held in Rittenhouse

Square, Philadelphia, on August 26, 1970. Their only pur-

pose was to call attention to the need for equal employment

rights for women. Most of the details of organizing the

rally were taken over by TASON since SOKEITOUS and others

did not have the time to devote to it and lacked the necessary

organizational ability.

When SOKEITOUS and her associates arrived at Ritten-

house square for the rally on August 26, 1970, they were

shocked to see organizations such as the CP,

the swe, and the

Black Panther Party (BPP) all represented there and all dis-

tributing literature.

A characterization of the BPP is contained

in the appendix hereto.

JASON made no attempt to conceal from the members

of POWER that she was a member of the SWP and stated that she

would be departing for Houston in the near future.

The fourth floor at 928 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia,

where POWER has its headquarters, is shared by a number of or-

ganizations to whom the telephone and rental expenses are pro-

rated.

These other organizations are the Gold Flower Brigade,

_Professional Momen's Caucus, -Homophile Action League, Lemple

University Women, PennsyIvania Association to Reveal Abortion

Law, Momen Inited or Abortion Rights, "and several other groups

for the study of racism, anthropology, and sex.

zation as a new civil rights group pledged to work actively

to bring women into

Literature distributed by POWER describes its goals

as follows:

Equal pay for equal work

Equal job and promotional opportunities

These goals are to be reached through education

and political action through the democratic process.

POWER planned a leadership training course on under-

standing local politics to be held twice weekly for a period

of lour weeks, beginning September 14, 1970, as a part of their

program to attain their stated goals.

A program announcement put out by Women's Liberation

discussions, and symposiums

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

aka

Black Panther Party for Self Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP was started

during December, 1966 in Oakland, California, to organize black people so they

can take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON, Minister

of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther", regularly states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

in its revolution-

ary program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an article by

the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY. This article ended with the

following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America, revolt

everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

is revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black power.

Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968 had an article introduced

with the following statement: "We will not dissent from American government.

We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the San Francisco

Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times", issue of December 13, 1969

was quoted as follows:

"We advocate the very direct overthrow of the govern-

ment by way of force and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had an article by

Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS

as follows:

NW 55160-DocId:32982641 Page 35

## Page 36

"The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking up

arms against this government, killing the officials, until

the reactionary forces...are dead, and those that are left

turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby passing

revolutionary judgement against the number one enemy of all

mankind, the racist U. S. government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street, Oakland,

California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to Combat Fascism, under

control of the BPP, have been established in various locations in the USA.

STUDENT MOBILIZATION COMMITTEE, aka

Student Mobilization Committee to

End the War in Vietnam;

National Student Mobilization Comnittee

A source advised on May 16, 1969 that the Student Mobilization

Committee originally grew out of the National Student Strike for Peace confer

ence held in Chicago, Illinois, on December 28-29, 1966, which resulted in a.

call for massive antiwar demonstrations in New York City and San Francisco,

California, on April 15, 1967.

The National Student Strike for Peace was

originally called by the Communist Party.

Divisions arose between elements

of the Connunist Party and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), culminating in

a takeover by the SWP element in the Summer of 1968 and the Communist Party

element withdrawing.

Source further advised the Student Mobilization Comnittee

locally and nationally is controlled by the SWP and its youth arm, Young

Socialist Alliance (YSA), as evidenced by their participation in Student

Mobilization Committee functions and their leadership role played in the

Student Mobilization Committee.

The SW has been designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

A report by the Committee on Un-American Activities, House of

Representatives, Ninetieth Congress, First Session, dated March 31, 1967,

entitled, "Conmunist Origin and Manipulation of Vietnan Week (April 8-15,

1967)" stated that the Student Mobilization Committee and the April 15, 1967

anti-war demonstrations were communist dominated and inspired.

A second source on April 3, 1969 made available a copy of "The

Student Mobilizer'' dated April 5, 1969, which was self-described as being

published by the National Office of the Student Mobilization Committee to End

the War in Vietnam, 857 Broadway, Room 30%, New lork, New lork 10003. In this

issue the aims of the Student Mobilization Committee were set forth as: Bring

the GIs home from Vietnam now; end campus complicity with the war; and win

self-determination for Vietnam and Black America.

In this issue of the publication, the Student Mobilization

Committee pledged itself to organize high school students, college students,

future draftees, GIs and all young people to fight until every last GI is

brought home.

celephone number had said that "Revolutionary Women's

Convention"

was being held on a farm in Limerick,

, Pa. The telephone number

FA 6-3008 in Limerick was given for transportation to the farm.

JEANETTE said the announcement for the convention was made at a

WLM meeting in New York City on 10/12/70.

On 10/22/70, It. GEORGE FENCI, Civil Disobedience Unit,

Philadelphia, Pa., Police Department, had one of his police

talked to a woman who identified herself as LEE.

LEE said each

attendee should expect to contribute $1.00 and should bring food

and wine. She said two films would be shown, one on abortion

and the other on an actual sex act being performed. The film on

the latter subject was to be narrated by

one of the women who

participated who would describe her feelings at the time.

They

she contact the "Plain Dealer" to let them know about this affair

and to have them promote it. The "Plain Dealer" is a Philadelphia

underground newspaper.

According to an article appearing in the "Pottstown

Mercury," Pottstown, Pa., on

6/25/51, a 120 acre farm near

Fagleysville, Pa., had been purchased by a national organization

to ease racial and religious intolerance and to study other

social problems.

The farm to be called Fellowship. Farm had been

owned by a wealthy eccentric Pottstown citizen.

Also referred to as Fellowship House, according to

the

article, the farm would be open

to students of junior and

senior high school age who had used the area in the past for

meetings.

Fellowship House is sponsored by the Society of

There were at that time 15 Fellow-

ship Houses in the country following the establishment of the

movement in 1931.

Fellowship House acquired Fellowship Farm,

according to a spokesnan,

"because we simply overflowed

all

available places in Philadelphia."

SAW. RICHARD THIRLWELL and SA JOHN C. 'F. MORRIS

surveyed the area at Fellowship Farm in the early hours of

10/25/70, and cruised through at first light. They obtained

the license numbers from cars parked in the parking area,

observing a number of people sleeping in sleeping

bags on the

ground near the cars.

Following this they gave a ride to a

white female, age about so, who said she was

an early riser and

was out looking

for coffee

and cigarettes.

Agents took her to

the Limerick Diner for breakfast.

She later introduced herself

as PHYLLIS: SCHUYLER, nee Harlow,

from New York City.

She said

members of WOMEN'S

LIBERATION had

gathered at the farm for a

weekend of discussions.

Agents listened to her talk for about

40 minutes without revealing their identity.

She talked

incessantly about women's rights, exploitation, unfair salary

schedules, the need for better, cheaper medicine for all, the

evils

of military industrial complex which contributes

to the

exploitation of women, the necessity for ending the stigma

attached to homosexuals of both sexes, and the need to erase

social pressures against illegitimate children.

Mrs. SCHUYLER

seemed to be hung up on sex.

She said

there were a number of lesbians at the camp who had put up

posters

"Lesbians Unite."

The avowed lesbians shared quarters

somewhat separated from the other women. Mrs. SCHUYLER has an

aversion to lesbians, she said, but she does

not think they

should be penalized for their

sexual habits.

She estimated that there were 200 to 300 people li

attendance at the conterence. "this is very doubtru...

She

said they had shown a film on the evening of 10/24/70, but

she had not seen it.

She understood it was newsreel type

footage.

Some of the women also put on a theater presentation

on the subject of exploitation, intending to illustrate how

the upbringing of children results in attitudes which cause

them to exploit each other.

She said the discussions and meetings held on

Saturday impressed her as

mainly bickering and yelling sessions

with all of the women trying to talk at once and the moderator

unable to maintain order. They put forth no clear-cut program,

arrived at no conclusions, and as of Sunday morning, appeared

to be no more cohesive than they had been when they first arrived

at the camp. Mrs. SCHUYLER said she personally was not sure what

she wanted, and she thought many of the other women felt the same

She regarded the whole thing as an opportunity for a

pleasant weekend in the country among other females of more or

common interests.

Agents took Mrs. SCHUYLER back to the farm, secured

additional license numbers, and observed a number of

women of

various ages who appeared to be just getting up.

Mrs. SCHUYLER said that each attendee had contributed

$1.00 and had brought some food. She thought the $1.00 might

have been to help pay

some of the overhead

and to pay kitchen

help which was provided to prepare the meals.

She said Fellow-

ship Farm is owned by the Quakers and that they made the farm

available to groups who desired to study means of bringing about

social improvements.

The leaflet stated the meeting was for people in-

terested in discussing the need for an active revolution

change without revolution is impossible."

The leaflet advised

those nanning to attend to contact New York telephone number

WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT CONFERENCE

HELD AT FELLOWSHIP FARM, LIMERICK, PA.,

ON OCTOBER 23-25, 1970

a phone call was made on October 22, 1970, to New York nhone

number 212-799-1008. The nhone was

answered by a woman who

identified herself as Lee.

Lee stated that each attendee

should contribute $1.00 and should bring food and wine.

She

stated two films would be shown, one on abortion, and the

other on an actual sex act being nerformed. A guerrilla

theater called "Burning City" was also being planned.

Un October 25, 1970, a fourth reliable source was

in the area of Fellowship Farm during the early morning hours

not spoke hate fer ended at City Les won

told source that members of Women's Liberation had gatherea

at the farm for a weekend of discussions.

cessantly about women's rights; exploitation; unfair salary

schedules; the need for better, cheaper medicine for all:

the evils of the military industrial complex which contributes

to the exploitation of women: the necessity for ending the

stigma attached to homosexuals of both sexes: and the need

to erase social nressures against illegitimate children.

She

advised there were a number of lesbians at the farm who had

put up

posters "Lesbians Unite" and that the lesbians shared

quarters somewhat

i separated from the other women.

Mrs. Schuyler estimated that there were 200 to 300

people in attendance at the conference.

She stated that a

film had

been shown on the evening of October 24, 1970, but

that she had not seen it. Some

• of the women

I also put on a

theater presentation on the subject of exploitation, intend-

Ing to illustrate how the uobringing of children results in

attitudes which cause them to exploit each other.

She said the discussions and meetings held on Saturday

impressed her as mainly bickering and yelling sessions with all

of the women trying to talk at once and the moderator unable

to maintain order.

arrived at no conclusions; and, as of sunday morning, anpeared

to be no more cohesive than they had been when they first

arrived. Mrs. Schuyler said she nersonally was not sure what

she wanted, and she thought many of the other women felt the

same way.

She regarded the whole thing as an onportunity for

a pleasant weekend in the country among other females of more

or less common interests.

The Bureau has been receiving numerous requests from

the House and Senate Select Committees. As an indication of

the number of requests being received, on September. 3, 1975,

we received four requests from the House Committee alone.

Many of the requests involve complex research and review

of

Bureau materials, etc. We have recently experienced continu-

ing pressure by both Committees to comply with their requests

as quickly as possible.

Additionally, we have received in-

dividual telephonic requests from Staff personnel of the

Committees to expedite one particular request ahead of another;

and in many instances, the request for expeditious handling of

a particular item conflicts with the request of some other Staff

Member.

The current

guidelines with the Senate Select Com-

mittee require responses be prepared on short dealines and it

has reached the point with regard to the Senate Select Com-

nittee that it is not possible to comply with their request.

within the stated deadlines.

While every effort is

being made

to abide by the

guidelines adopted by the Department and

Committee, the shear volume of the material requested and

work involved makes compliance with these

guidelines not

possible.

SA Daly of this Division brought this matter to the

attention of Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for In-

telligence Coordination in the Department

he understood the problems being generated in the weste

requests being received by the FBI.

Shaheen subsequently advised SA Daly that he had::

brought this matter to the attention of the Senate Select

Committee orally in a conversation with Mark Gitenstein on

9/4/75 including the problems being encountered with in-

dividual Staff Members declaring that their particular

request had a higher priority than any other particular

request.

Gitenstein told Shaheen that he would attempt to

correct this problem.

In a subsequent conversation with Start Member Mark

Gitenstein, Gitenstein stated he had been informed by the

Department of the problem the Bureau is encountering in

responding within the deadlines set for various Committee

requests.

He indicated that he would take

steps to make

sure individual Staff Members do not on their own initiative

attempt to place their request ahead of any other particular

request without coorcinating it with him. Additionally, he

stated it was his intention to bring this to the attention of

John Elliff, Task Force Dixector of the Domestic Task Force of

the Senate Select Committee, and

suggest a meeting be held with

Bureau representatives on Monday, 9/8/75,

in an effort to solve

this particular problem.

LI a meeting is held on that date, It

is expected that 'a representative of the Intelligence Division,

Legal Counsel Division and the Department will be in attendance.

Dear Mr. Wannall:

Telephone Rm. -

Director Sec'y —

On April 24, 1975, Director Kelley responded tour reque:

regarding the Bureau's legal authority to conduct domestic intelli-

gence operations by providing material concerning the collection,

maintenance, dissemination, and destruction of information resulting

from such investigations.

We have reviewed that portion of the Bureau's response relating

to its authority to conduct domestic intelligence investigations

and

believe that some clarification of matters therein is necessary for

us to better understand the Bureau's position.

Accordingly, we would

appreciate a written response to the enclosed questions which relate

to the papers prepared by you and Messrs. Watters and Lacey;

a portion

of the Domestic Intelligence Division position paper, "Investigations

of Subversion," May 19, 1972; and portions of Sections 87 and 122 of

the FBI Manual. To facilitate analysis, we would appreciate if the

Bureau could use the same format as the questions with any questions

not requiring an answer because of a prior response being so noted.

Should you or your staff desire to discuss these questions for

any reason, we would be glad to do so. If any clarification is needed,

please call Alan S. Goldberg on 386-3575. Thank you for your cooperation.

On 9/5/75, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division was

advised by Michael

E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination in the Department, that Paul

Wallach of the Senate Select Committee had informed him

that the Committee desired the presence of Shaheen and

SA Daly at an executive session at 2 p.m., Tuesday,

9/9/75, to explain why the material requested relating

to mail openings had not been delivered to the Committee.

Shaheen requested that every effort be made by the

Bureau to avoid the necessity of explaining to the Committee

the lack of production of the mail opening material at the

executive session.

The above information was brought to the attention

of Paul Mack, Executive Assistant to the Deputy Associate

Director (Investigations) who in turn advised that Mr. Adams

had instructed that every effort be made to produce the re-

quested material prior to the executive session.

Unit Chief James Lee was advised of this decision.

RET

The subject of above SSC inquiry, Joseph Kraft,

is the well-known newspaper columnist. A review of the

Kraft file reveals that the French security service, the

DST, conducted a microphone surveillance on Kraft's hotel

room for approximately one week during a 1969 visit by

Kraft to Paris.

such coverage was effected through the

urging of W. C. Sullivan former Assistant to the Director

who travelled to France at such time apparently at the

direction of deceased FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Details'

of the above coverage have appeared in the media apparently

as a result of leaks within the administration of former

President Nixon.

Kraft himself testified in đetail 5/10/74,

regarding this matter before the United State Senate Subcom-

mittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, the Subcon-

mittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judi-

ciary, and the Subcommittee on Surveillance of the Committee

on Foreign Relations. Pursuant to an agreement between

Kraft and the Attorney General certain documents, recordings

On 8/22/75, Supervisor David Rarity, JI., advised

that the Senate Select Committee was going to interview Dr.

Sidney Gottlieb of the CIA in the near future.

Rarity stated

that the Bureau had a pending investigation captioned "Dr.

Sidney Gottlieb-Destruction of Government Property" involving

Gottlieb relating to his destruction of certain records at the

Ten relating to his dee

Central Intelligence Agency and requested that a determination

be made as to whether such an interview was being contemplated

by the Committee.

John Elliff, Task Force Director of the Domestic

Task Force for the Senate Select Committee, was telephonically

advised of our investigative interest in Mr. Gottlieb and of

our desire that the Committee be aware of this investigative

interest so that their activities would not adversely impact

on the Bureau's investigation.

Elliff was appreciative of

being advised and indicated that he was also aware of the

Senate Select Committee's interest in Dr. Gottlieb and would

insure

that the Committee Staff Member was apprised of the

Bureau's investigative interest.

He stated they would take

Bureau's investigation in this matter.

Barbara Banoff, SSC staff member, previously requested

that a number of serials relating to White Hate matters be excised so

that they could be delivered to SSC offices. The attached list contains

212 copies relating to White Hate which have been excised and reviewed

by the appropriate Section Chief for delivery to SSC offices. One set

of the 212 serials is being permanently maintained in roor 4126, JEH.

involve the suggestion of removal of myself from a certain

4

'important phase of the SENSTUDY-75 project which concerns the

Martin Luther King, Jr., case. I intend to set forth in this

memorandum arguments and other observations which I believe

will best serve the Bureau's land, thusly, also the Department's

interests in considering the suggestions of Senator Church and

i; of the Department.

My Motivation in Resisting the Suggestions for Removal

AS

Lis.

It would be easy indeed for me to sit back and accept

Suadimy removal from the King case aspects of SENSTUDY-75. I have

not found my efforts in this matter to be necessarily a picnic

6076 or Sunday fun-outing.

Rather, I have experienced mental strain

FILEU

and fatigue from this work but, nonetheless, have always tried,

to the

best of my ability, to do what I have felt is in the

Bureau's best interests.

I do not think my removal is in the

COP

Bureau's best interests and being the most knowledgeable person

ED

FINALIZED

in the Bureau on this matter I feel compelled to present my

views in as candid a way as I can for the benefit of the Directors

and other Bureau officials in their consideration of this matter a

about the only real issue on which we have shown unbending

resistance has been that concerning the revelation of the

identities of our confidential informants--and that issue

is still in dispute.

Now comes another issue which on its surface may

appear small but which I consider a major one.

nas are 4 ca

And this issue

concerns me personally and is difficult for me to be 100 per

cent objective about, try as I might. On every review of

this

matter I still come up with the same conclusion.

We must not

let ourselves be dictated to in how and with what personnel we

intend to defend ourselves.

(And let us not kid ourselves.

When I say "defend," I mean that we are playing this "game"

with our defensive

unit).

To sum it up, it is as though the

opposition not only wants to make the rules of the game, but

also insists on dictating who and who not we can use in the

game.

It is that simple.

What Is the SSC's Motivation Which Has Created This Issue?

Obviously, I cannot answer this question with any

degree of certainty.

But I can make a studied guess. I have

been the Bureau's consultant on theyinterviews by the SSC, most

of them by soc stall Member Michaelstenin the king case!

There have been instances When, aften consulting with me, an

Agent or former Agent would be

counseled by me to not answer a

particular question.

I have done this generally for two main

reasons.

First and

foremost, it has been vitally necessary for

me to protect the identities of most important and valued

Informants relating to the SOLO operationand more will be (u

been many instances where the interview has gone well outside

agreed upon parameters necessitating my advice in some

instances for personnel to not answer certain questions. This

was the correct and only course of action I could take. It

has obviously rankled the SSC (actually, probably just Epstein).

I believe that this is evident from the

: 34-page LHM which I

recently prepared on Epstein interview of me and which I have been

told the consensus is that it clearly indicated my considerable

cooperation with the SSC but that at the same time I was not

permitting myself to be dominated.

If Epstein believes me a

hindrance to his work, it is logical to believe he would desire

my removal.

I might add at this point that there have been a

number of instances

has resulted in my directing that answers be given.

As a

matter of tact,

I am sure that

to be given that to not be given.

If lotten directed answers

When the issue (involving my removal) first arose

about two weeks ago, I was given to understand that Epstein,

as a result of interviewing me, might believe that I had a

direct involvement in the King composite tape which was

prepared in the Laboratory and mailed to the King family and

that there, therefore, appeared to be a "conflict in interest"

on my part if I continued to handle the King case aspects for

SENSTUDY-75. As I full well know, and as I believe my

superiors are also convinced, I have been honest and forthright

on this issue. I was not directly involved in the composite

tape preparation or mailing and thus there is no "conflict of

interest."

The Shaheen Letter of 8/20/75

I do not believe that Shaheen's letter and its relay

of the Deputy Attorney General's (DAG) suggestion as to my

removal is altogether timely under the circumstances. First,

Shaheen is aware that I was interviewed on the King case and

that he would receive the results thereof, as he has of all King

interviews we know details about. Shouldn't Shaheen and indeed

ade thes

the DAG have first had the benefit of the results of the interview

of me? (Shaheen now has it as my 34-page LHM was delivered to

him 8/20/75).

Secondly, wouldn't it have been far more

appropriate for the Department to have at least first asked for

our views before making the suggestion as to my removal?

The DAG refers to Church's letter as having "some

merit." I find "some merit" unconvincing.

It seems to me that

for the action being asked for by the DAG's suggestion there

should be a showing by Church of considerable or substantial

merit, not just "some." To me, "some" could apply to merit which

is minuscle in proportion.

Arguments Persuasive of My Not Being Removed

I am concerned of the precedent that might be set by my

removal. Just as I have by chance become the Bureau's "expert"

on the King case and also had supervised that case, we have two

other similar situations in the hopper at the moment. Supervisor

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE :

SENSTUDY -75

62-116395

James Lee has been considerably involved in handling our responses

to the ssC concerning mail opening operations and he personally

supervised matters relating to this down

through the years.

Supervisor David Ryan has been immersed in preparing material and

coordinating the preparation of material relating to COINTELPRo.

He likewise was the principal overall Bureau supervisor relating

to COINTELPRO down through the years.

significantly, both ot

these areas, like the King case, have been designated as abuse

areas by the SSC. Remove Phillips today from the King case and

we might be asked to remove Lee and Ryan tomorrow from their

participating in the SENSTUDY-75 project.

Surely we cannot

permit the loss of these men in these important areas.

In his letter, Church refers to my "personal interest."

I have no personal interest as I am not guilty of any illegality,

impropriety, abuse or whatever.

My only interest in the King

case has and remains an official one and I am prepared to defend

anything and everything I did officially in that case.

There is no showing in either of the communications

attached that the FBI's (and, thusly, also the Department's)

interests will be adversely affected by my continued assignment

in this matter.

Conversely, there are strong arguments available

to show that my being removed could well work to the detriment of

the FBI/Department. I refer now to our SOLO operation and the

overriding necessity for protecting the informants engaged therein

There has already been one clear cut important example where I

believe it is likely that I prevented information from being

acquired by the SSC which could well have been damaging to us

and the informants.

This concerned the testimony in an Executive

Session of former SA Robert Nichols.

I accompanied him to that

Session although not present.

My questioning of him in advance

of his testimony revealed that he had, or at least believed he had,

revealed, that

certain information which, if given to the SSC, about one Stanley

Levison, could well have been most damaging to

the secret Communist Party member who was King's principal

advisor).

When questioning of Nichols turned to Levison's back-

ground, Nichols resisted questioning and eventually told Epstein

that he was proceeding on advice of me. I felt that it was

imperative to have given him that advice and the record of the

Nichols testimony and factors relating thereto are clear on this.

HIAL

Immodestly I must be candid to let you know that there

is not likely another individual presently on the rolls of the

Bureau who would have the background and knowledge of all aspects

of the king and related matters to be able to handle the important

consultation phase of the SENSTUDY-75 project relating to the

King matter.

Additional Observations Which Should Be Considered in Any Overall

Judgment On This Matter

In his letter, Shaheen refers to "for the sake of

appearances."

To me this is far too general and imprecise to

be used as an argument of merit. Just exactly who does he

have in mind in respect to "appearances?" Appearances to whon?

Senator Church is equally imprecise in his reference to

"standpoint of appearances." Appearances to whom? He refers to

"some may conclude" that there is a conflict between my personal

interest and the interests of the FBI and the Department of

Justice. Exactly who are the "some" he refers to?

It appears to be an irony indeed that Church can very

indirectly and obliquely suggest possible improprieties on my

part, improprieties in the eyes of unspecified persons, without

the Senator citing even a single specific example or incident

and his obvious lack of ability to do so after

the exposure by

the SSC to considerable involvement on my part. I say it is

ironical because at the same time that there is an oblique

suggestion as to an impropriety on my part, the sse staff, whicl

is looking into abuses, has been guilty.

There are a number oi

improprieties which I am prepared to document. Some examples are

illustrated.

After my first consultation experience which occurred

in Atlanta, Georgia, when SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel

interviewed retired

SA Alan G. Sentinella, I wrote a memorandum

from W. O. Cregar to you (Mc. Wannall) dated 5/13/75.

I pointed

out two instances related to this interview which were very

suggestive of a lack of objectivity on the part of Seidel.

One

concerned Seidel's comment

that the FBI was not letting Sentinella

give him

"good information."

I pointed out that to begin with

this was an unjustified allegation and Seidel was set straight

immediately after his remark.

Actually, the mere fact that Seidel

was referring to "good" information suggested that certain

information fits SSC's desires and others does not.

There appeared

to be a lack of regard for merely securing the

facts regardless of

what those facts might indicate. Another indicator of lack of

objectivity was sender stinguy about

"illegal use of taps."

RE:

SENSTUDY -75

62-116395

Our files are replete with instances where Epstein, in

questioning present and former SAs, has gone outside the parameters

agreed upon for interviews.

There have been instances where interviews were

conducted with former SAs without giving us agreed advance

recently one pertained to former

Laboratory section chiet Richard Millen and John IllifE of

the SSC, when it was brought to his attention, agreed that

we should have had advance notice and apologized.

Another

concerned an interview former Assistant Director Charles Brennan.

I find the bulk of Church's letter is comprised of

weasel-worded innuendos. He uses such terms as "may be

a cause of

concern"; "possible problem"; "presumably, compiling

materials." The latter reference is to a presumption that I am

compiling materials for the SSC on the King case.

It seems to

me that the Senator should either know or not know the fact, and

if he does not know, he should not presume anything. To set the

record straight, I have not been compiling materials. The

assignments have been made to other personnel.

I have, however,

assisted the other personnel in locating materials and

in

coordinating replies.

And, of course, I do review the replies

prior to their transmittal.

As a matter of fact, if the SSC's

insistence that I be removed were to come to pass, I believe

that it would end up

having actually suffered to a degree in

securing information from us. Our retrieval system is not the

best Ior the purposes we have encountered and my participation

in the retrieval of much of the material involved has placed me

in a position to locate or assist in locating material whicl

might well otherwise never be located for the SSC.

It seems strange indeed that in these days of such

concern by Congress for the rights and privacy of individuals,

there seems to be no addressing my privacy or rights in this matter.

I find it also strange that the Senator never once

mentioned my name in his letter. He, or whoever prepared the

letter, certainly knew my name.

I would like to know why the

Senator chose not to mention my name.

RE :

SENSTUDY -75

62-116395

FIDENTIAL

Again referring to when this matter first surfaced

about two weeks ago, the initial advice to me of it was by you,

Mr. Wannall, who had obtained your information orally from

Messrs. Shaheen and Blackhurst of the Department, who had

apparently received their information orally from the SSC. I

explained my position and I received from you your confidence

One aspect related to the fact that the SSC "compläint"

was far too general and that if the SSC had something to say it

ought to be in writing and specific. I appreciated and so stated

to you this confidence in my integrity in this entire matter.

You next told me that you had discussed this matter with

Associate Director Callahan who shared your views both as to my

integrity and as to the issue relating to obtaining specifics,

not generalities, and in writing.

It heartened me.

Finally,

you passed to me the fact that Mr. Callahan had discussed the

matter with the Director and the general reaction was that the

SSC would first have to

• "put up or shut up" before any action

would be taken as

to my removal. This was likewise most

heartening to me.:

I

see nothing in either the Church or Shaheen letters

that indicates the SSC has "put up." As far as I am concerned

the SSC has dealt with generalities and has produced nothing

of substance.

I trust that our position

today would be, the same

as it was initially, "put up or shut up."

Not surprising is Church's verbiage, such as serving

"the interests of the country" and

"assure the American people."

To me, this may sound alright as a speech on the floor of the

Senate or a political speech.

It is very unconvincing to me in

the context of the issue involved.

Summarizing and concluding as to the Church letter, .

em reminded of the often told story about the Texan, a man of

considerable proportion, some 6'6"

in height and weighing about

250 pounds. As the story goes, when all the Bs is squeezed out

ALL'NFORMATION CONTAINED

I am writing to call your attention to a mat-

ter which may be a cause of concern to you and to the

Select Committee at some time in the future.

you may know, a special unit has been estab-

lished in th= FBI Intelligenca Division to bandle this

Conmittee's requests for materials and to handle certain

arrangements for the Committee staff's interviews.

Special Agents assigned to this unit accompany Bureau

witnesses to the Committee offices, travel to out-of-town

locations where Committee staff interviews are conducted,

and apparently "de-brief" interview subjects after the

interviews.

One possible problem has arisen with this arrange-

ment.

As you are aware, one of the alleged abuses which

the Committee is examining pursuant to S: Res. 21 involves

the FBI's activities with respect to the late Dr. Martin

Luther King, JI.

As the inquiry has proceeded, informa-

tion has been developed to indicate that one of the

•Special Agents who has been handling Committee staff inter-

views,

"de-briefing" witnesses, and, presumably, compiling

materials with respect to the King matter was also the

supervisory case agent during the time that some of the

alleged FBI improprieties regarding DI. King took place.

determine the nature and extent of his involvement in and

knowledge of the alleged abuses at the time when he served

as supervisory case agent with respect to the King case.

During the interview he did provide detailed information

concerning his substantial participation in this matter.

The Committee in no way intends at this juncture

to pre-judge the propriety of the FBI's activities with

respect to Dr. King, and it would be inappropriate to

the conduct of any of the Bureau's personnel

interests of the FBI and the Depärtment of Justice might

best be served, from the standpoint of appearances, by re-

cunsidering the assignment di this opcoial Agent to the

of the San Francisco Office.

This meeting occurred over dinner.

No statements were made by either of these individuals as to

any rights

that SAC Bates might have in connection with the

interview.

During the dinner, Mr. Seidel referred to COINTELPRO

involving the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco. Bates advised him that he was in charge of

the San Francisco Office from July, 1967 until the end of

April, 1970, when he was transferred to Chicago. Bates stated

that he was

aware of the investigation being conducted on the

Black Panther Party but was not personally conversant with

all the details of this investigation as such details were

all contained in the FBI's file.

Mr. Seidel referred to specific facts occurring in other parts

of the country involving anonymous letters sent to individuals

under COINTELPRO. He asked if Bates agreed that these actions

were proper.

Mr. Seidel was told that Bates had no way of

knowing the facts as he related were true or any other of

the circumstances

involved and that, therefore, he was unable

to comment at all.

MI. Seidel asked if Bates had any recommendations

for legislatión which the Committee could propose that would

assist

the FBI in the domestic counterintelligence field.

Bates informed him that he was not fully conversant with this

entire field and that it was thefperogative of FBI officials

•at Washington and Department of Justice officials to recommend

such legislation.

that an extension of electronic surveillances into the domestic

intelligence field would be of assistance. Bates informed

him that the FBI was operating according to current court

decisions as involve electronic surveillances and that the

courts had recently precluded this action in strictly domestic

intelligence matters.

Mr. Seidel was informed that this was

a decision for FBI officials in Washington.

occasion Bates informed him that he was not aware of the

"Houston Plan" and his only knowledge of it is what he has

seen in the public press.

At one time Mr. Johnson asked if

thought that Mr. Hoover had turned down the "Houston

Plan" because he was afraid for his job. Bates again replied

that he had no firsthand knowledge having anything to do with

"Houston Plan" but he was certainly aware that Mr. Hoover

was not afraid

of anything or anyone.

Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt

that the use of "black bag jobs"

would be of advantage in

conducting domestic counterintelligence operations.

Bates

replied that he had no personal direct knowledge of such matters

and

had never been involved in such matters.

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt that the

Bates informed him that it

appeared that the FBI's efforts in both the criminal and the

security field had been effective and appeared to be proper

in its present context.

Mr. Seidel inquired if Bates was

personally acquainted with Mr. William C. Sullivan, former

FBI official.

Mr. Seidel was informed that Bates worked in

the same division with Mr. Sullivan in the 1950's and knew

him

as another supervisor at FBI Headquarters.

Seidel then asked if Bates was aware of the dis-

agreements that Mr. Sullivan had had with Mr. Hoover and he

was informed that he had no details concerning this matter.

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates

knew former SAC Harry

him as

then asked It Bates was aware of why Mr. Morgan was transierrea

from San Francisco,

Bates told him that some problem had

but that they would be available at FBI, Headquarters.

said the only reason he was asking was that he was thinking

about interviewing Mr. Morgan but he did not want to embarrass

him and then asked if Morgan's transfer from San Francisco

had anything to do with a drinking problem.

Bates said again

that he was not aware of the specifics.

on the afternoon of August 13, 1975, Mr. Lock Johnson

came into the San Francisco FBI Office saying he had just a

few more questions he wanted to ask Bates.

He then asked if

the San Francisco Office was involved in foreigh counter-

intelligence work, and he was informed that we were as were

many other FBI offices.

He then asked if we surveilled every-

one who went into or came out of the Soviet Consulate in San

Francisco.

He was informed that Bates did not intend to dis-

cuss with

him any investigative techniques or anything having

to do with pending investigations.

'INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

Is it necessary for agent to express an opinion

as to morality, legality of said Counterintelligence

Program (COINTEL) ?

Answer: You are not obliged to answer those

questions you do not desire to answer, but if you wish you

may comment on the legality or morality of the plan.

SA DENNIS MILLER related that he desired that it

be borne in mind that the Bureau in no way wished to impede

the SSC investigation.

LESTER B. SEIDEL, SSC Staff Member, appeared at the

'San Francisco Office of the FBI on August 11, 1975, and

interviewed :SA LEO BRENNEISEN from 1:03 PM to 2:30

PM.

SEIDEL prefaced the interview by explaining that hé had

been advised that BRENNEISEN was the Coordinator for the

COINTEL in San Francisco from May 16, 1969 to May I, 1970.

It was pointed out to him that the case was assigned to

agent from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1971.

SEIDEL asked if agent had, in fact, approved all

proposals coming from the San Francisco Office. He was

advised that not necessarily because if another agent made

a proposal the person approving it in San Francisco would

be the person signing the outgoing mail, namely, the Supervisor

or Relief

supervisor.

SEIDEL asked what Squad agent had been assigned

to during this Program,

and he was advised S-6.

He inquired

if there was any COINTEL in San Francisco against US; he

was advised to the contrary.

He inquired as to the usual

number of cases assigned agent, and was advised that to

agent's best recollection probably 30 at any one time. He

asked if agent's work was exclusively security during the

handling of the COINTEL Program and he was advised

agent

did have some criminal assignments.

He inquired it there

was

any relationship between COINTEL and

criminal assignments,

and he was advised no and that agent desired to limit the

scope of his questioning to the COINTEL Program.

SEIDEL then asked how many suggestions the agent

had submitted in COINTEL. . He was advised that an estimate

would be difficult but probably the nearest figure would be

some two suggestions a month with possibly six months in

two years when no suggestions were made. He inquired as

to agent's knowledge of what percentage of total proposals

from all

sources submitted to the Bureau had been approved,

and he was advised

, U.S. " SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

At this point, SEIDEL requested agent to outline the

types of COINTEL proposals submitted by San Francisco.

He

was answered that anonymous letters, letters with pseudonyms,

and letters signed with the name of an existing person had

It was pointed out that the program had included

the use of anonymous letters, including those directed to

landlords advising that the Black Panther Party was occupying

their property; letters to people supporting BIP programs,

' including the Breakfast Program and enclosing copies of the

BPP color book for children encouraging the shooting of

police officers and/or articles from the "Black Panther

Party", the official BPP newspaper, showing their propensity

and

advocacy of violence; letters to organizations containing

articles that showed the BPP in direct opposition to their

aims, such as a letter to a Jewish organization showing BPP

support

of palestine guerrillas.

It was pointed out that letters had been directed

to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER in Algeria in the names of BPP members.

At this point, SEIDEL interrupted to explain that he was

enlisting the

complete cooperation of the interviewee, that

there had been some Congressional criticism of the COINTEL,

that there were some segments of the population that were

anti-FBI and that he desired to present the FBI in a proper

desiret to

light, and that he

had good friends in the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked, was it necessary to have utilized

COINTEL. Agent advised that it was difficult to correctly.

judge the effect of the program but it was felt it was not

without some effect because the Black Panther Party had not

only dwindled from a

• membership of approximately 1,000 in

1969 to perhaps 200 in 1973, but that the organization became

split with dissension and had dropped much of its former

advocacy for violence.

SEIDEL then requested that the agent give his

recommendation on what COINTEL in the future should be;

whether there should be a division between security and

criminal investigations to different agencies in order that

a possible intrusion on the rights of an individual in

intelligence matters might not necessarily preclude his

being prosecuted by the Bureau

types of COINTEL proposals, SEIDEL next asked if the

at the time COINTEL was initiated, and what proposals were

submitted in COINTEL based on information from ELSUR.

SEIDEL was advised agent's release would not allow

him to discuss ELSUR.

SEIDEL asked if the San Francisco Division had made

any "snitch" proposals. When asked to clarify

the question,

he stated that this was a suggestion to the effect that a

Black Panther Party member be accused of being an FBI

informant.

Agent replied that to the best of his recollection

no such recommendations had been made

to the Bureau by San

Francisco, and on the contrary, agent knew that it had been

pointed out by San Francisco that any such allegation. should

be most carefully considered inasmuch as BPP history has

indicated that they had dealt severely with suspected infor-

mants, even to the point of killing them.

SEIDEL then asked if the San Francisco Division

had received a great deal of "flak" from the Bureau on this

program.

He was advised that the Bureau operates a "tickler

system"

for following investigations and that the program

had received some priority from the fBI but agent had never

considered correspondence from the Bureau as being "flak".

SEIDEL at this point instead of questioning made

the statement that the Bureau gave this matter "high priority".

No comment was made to this statement.

SEIDEL next questioned agent if he had read any

publicity concerning a May 1l, 1970 letter from the Bureau

- to San Francisco entitled, "Special Operations Research", in

which it was suggested that some consideration be given to

furnishing the BPP spurious documents that supposedly

originated with the Oakland Police Department and the FBI.

He explained that some newspaper had received a copy of the

document under the Freedom of Information Act and thereafter

published it. He inguired if a response to the letter

## Page 124

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

had been made by San Francisco. Agent advised that it was

his recollection that San Francisco had responded recommending

against both proposals, pointing out that the BEP had in the

short past published contingency plans of the Berkeley Police

Department for a said on National Headquarters to the

embarrassment of that agency.

San Francisco was of the

opinion that if spurious documents were furnished to the

BPP they would immediately publish them, rather than attempt

to develop an informant and the operation presented a great

• deal of possible embarrassment and publicity for the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked for agent's knowledge of why the letter

had been captioned as previously described rather than

Counterintelligence Program, Black Panther Party. Agent

stated he had no recollection of exact caption of the letter.

SEIDEL then went on to explain that he had been advised

that

the Bureau had several COINTELS and the one covering Special

operations Research was

a COINTEL covering foreign operations.

Agent made no comment.

SEIDEL requested what proposals had been made to

disrupt the BPP newspaper; how did the proposals originate,

and what offices submitted them. He was advised that it was

agent's recollection that the Bureau may have requested

suggestions from several offices but that to agent's knowledge

none had been approved.

When SEIDEL continued to question the

agent concerning specific proposals and why their approval

was not recommended by San Francisco, he was advised that one

proposal was the use

of a foul-smelling chemical to put on

the paper. San Francisco was of the opinion it would not .

be practical inasmuch as it would contaminate an airplane

and would subject the airline or the printing company to

damages. SEIDEL was further advised that it was believed

the suggestion may have been made for the changing of a first

page of an issue at the printing company to embarrass the BPP,

but it was pointed out that this would also merely result in

• a claim being filed against the printer.

SEIDEL was advised that there may have been a

suggestion that some thought should be given to the possible

delay of the plates for the paper, that suggestion coming .

at the time when the paper was being printed in New York

with the master copy being filmed in San Francisco. San

Francisco did not suggest approval because a mere delay would

have been of little benefit because the paper was not timely.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

SEIDEL asked about the disruption of the BPP

Breakfast Program. The answer was given that agent had

no recollection of this, and SEIDEL was asked did he have

any information from the Bureau that we had attempted a

disruption of the program in San Francisco. He related

that he believed not and that it probably happened ir

San Diego.

SEIDEL asked about a suggestion that informants

set up a possible confrontation between the BPP and the

Republic of New Africa (RNA). Agent stated he had no

recollection of such a proposal and did not believe it had

been

submitted by San Francisco because the membership and

activity in RNA had been minimal in this area.

SEIDEL then asked if we had suggested that landlords

in the San Francisco area be encouraged to insist on their

rent from the BPP. Agent advised he had no recollection

of this, but could see nothing wrong in it.

SEIDEL inquired as to the amount of knowledge.

that SAC CHARLES BATES would have had concerning COINTEL.

He was advised that agent had no information, that he, himself,

had never discussed the program with Mr. BATES while it was

in operation SEIDEl, then inquired if former SAC HARRY

MORGAN had been ill during the time he was assigned to San

Francisco-and-the reason for his transfer.

Agent replied

he had"no information concerning-this-matter.

SEIDEL was asked if he felt that anyof the actions

agent described as being taken by the San Francisco Division

were illegal. SEIDEL stated that he did not believe that

these were matters that were in violation of any existing

criminal statutes, but there might be some question as to

whether the FBI had the specific authority to do these things.

SEIDEL ended the interview by again reiterating

• inquiry and

desired to obtain the opinions of both Headquarters

and agents in the field, and that he may make a request to the

Bureau to widen the scope of agent's release.

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 13, 1975, former Special Agent Albert P.

Clark, who was a supervisor in the San Francisco FBI Office

and who retired in December of 1969, advised as follows:

He was interviewed in his home at 66 Elm,

Larkspur, California, by SSC Member Lester B. Seidel from

5:40 P.M. to 6:55 P.M., August 12, 1975.

Clark was not placed under oath and no mention

was made of his rights. However, Seidel was pleasant and

in no way antagonistic. The interview was general, not

penetrative, not in depth, and very few specific questions were

asked.

There appeared to be no discernible criticism of

either the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) or the

Bureau's investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) Dy

Seidel.

Seidel was compelled on more than one occasion

to declare that he was pro-FBI, that the object of his

inquiries was to assist the United States Senate in under-

standing the problem in order that they could consider

possible legislation that may eliminate any abuses in the

future.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel finally asked Clark if he would have okayed

a COINTEL proposal like this and he answered that he would

have if he felt that it would have sufficiently hindered

the BPP, stating that possibly in some of these occasions

someone might get hurt but on the other hand,

of the BPP by the FBI might be made easier and it might

also cut down on the number of BPP supporters.

Clark was asked to whom the main BPP case was

assigned and to whom COINTEL had been assigned in the San

Francisco Division.

Clark replied that he did not remember

but possibly during the time of his supervision, more than

one Agent.had handled the matters.

Seidel asked how many BPP informants the San

Francisco Division had. Clark replied he did not recall

one he did not believe that selded had a right to know.?

seidel inquired about the BPP wire tap, asking

who had requested the tap, the Bureau or the San

• Francisco

Division.

Again, Clark replied that he did not recall but

the San Francisco Division would not have necessarily

waited for the Bureau to initiate the matter but might have

requested the Bureau rather than the Bureau having initiated

the matter.

Seidel wanted to have an example of a COINTEL

proposal.

He was not given a specific example but general

conversation was had to the effect that any move that might

be suggested that would aid the San Francisco Division in

their investigation of the BPP in determining their

supporters and financiers and possibly disenchanting those

individuals might be an example.

Seidel did not ask Clark whether he had done a

particular thing.

Questioned concerning whether he felt COINTEL had

been effective, Clark replied he did not believe the matter

was susceptible to proof but the BPP had sure gone into a

steep decline.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel again brought up the Seberg matter and

asked if it had done any good. Clark stated he replied,

"Maybe."

During this conversation, Clark got the general

impression that perhaps Seidel did not feel that COINTEL

had been necessary but Clark had argued that it had made

the BPP more difficult to operate and possibly easier

for the FBI to investigate.

Seidel then wanted to know what there was about

the BPP that caused such a concentration of FBI investi-

gative attention.

to be answered in the context of time, that at the time the

program was initiated, there was no doubt that the BPP

a violent, racist organization opposing all law enforce-

ment, attacking officers and

generally disturbing the

tranquility of the community.

Seidel then went on to discuss the business of

Had Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

and the Bureau put too much pressure on the matter? Clark

stated there was undoubtedly pressure because everyone

was interested in doing the best type job possible

and

finding out everything possible concerning the BPP. There

was obvious pressure from the Bureau in the matter and the

Bureau, in a

case like this, could never be satisfied.

Clark stated that he related that perhaps too much

pressure had come from the Bureau because he had felt at

the time he was a

supervisor that San Francisco Division

knew more about the BPP than the Bureau. On the other

hand, he related that Bureau officials were probably

under pressure because of the national interest and the

demands on them in Washington.

Seidel related that he was interested in ascer-

taining what Agent would make the best witness to appear

in Washington to explain and testify concerning COINTEL.

He specifically requested Clark's recommendation and mentioned

the names of Special Agents Leo S. Brenneisen of San

Francisco and Bob Baker of Los Angeles.

Clark stated that

he had countered by suggesting that somebody in Washington

who directed the program and approved all proposals might

be a better witness.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Clark recalled that near the first of the inter-

view, Seidel probably, more to make conversation than to

obtain information, asked a few questions concerning US

and the Republic of North Africa (RNA). He was

advised

that US had not been active in this division and there had

been no pertinent RNA activity brought to his attention.

Seidel asked if Ron Karenga of US had visited San Francisco

and Clark replied he had no exact recollection of this.

Seidel talked and asked Clark's opinion on the

separation into different agencies of the Bureau's criminal

security investigations.

Clark stated that he told

Seidel that in the past he had considered this and felt that

frankly it might have advantages, and at the same time,

might have disadvantages.

He pointed out that the

disadvantages were that you could not be sure that it, in

fact, would work and that if you remove the security

investigations from the Bureau, you would undoubtedly

lose a great deal, including public support.

Seided asked if Clark had worked under former

SAC Harry- Morgan.

He advised that he had retired prior tô- - -

the time Morgan was assigned tö the San Francisco Division. ...

Clark pointed out that during the interview, a

recorder appeared prominently on his desk, and Seidel.

could, of course, not be sure that it was not in operation,

although as the duration of the interview lengthened,

it

must have been obvious to seidel that it was not operating.

21:15 A.M. by Lester B: Seidel, Investigator fola issci..

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activites

The interview took place at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness

Avenue, San Francisco.

Mr. Seidel mentioned that he was serving as a

counsel for the SSC, investigating all phases of the United

States intelligence community, and he had chosen the Black

Panther Party and the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL)

as his field. He stated that he was hoping for full

cooperation on the part of the former Special Agent.

He was advised that former Special Agent Cohendet

was willing

to cooperate with the committee and he trusted

that something constructive would come out of the effort

being put forward.

Former Special Agent Cohendet also

pointed out that in his opinion the Black Panther Party (BPP)

had, been a group devoted to violence, thievery, and traud,

and the committee should realize the type of Subjects with

whom they are dealing in order to place the investigation

who approved them.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

The former Special Agent replied that he was

not party to any of these arrangements and did not know

any of the details.

Seidel then asked if former Special Agent

Cohendet knew the origin and purposes of the COINTEL

Program. He was informed that the former Agent did not

know the origin of the program, and said he believed its

purposes were those as set forth in the instructions which

Seidel had and which spoke for themselves.

The former

Agent admitted that said program at one time had been

assigned to him but due to the press of other functions,

he had been unable to give it a great deal of time and

felt that during the period that it had been assigned to

him, it had been largely ineffective.

Seidel then asked if there was any connection

between ELSUR and COINTEL and the reply was given that

obviously there would be if the ELSUR material being

reviewed could be considered as having any pertinence to

a COINTEL operation.

However, former Special Agent Cohendet

could not recall having used this material while the case

was assigned to him, at least to any

significant degree.

Not having the files available made it impossible to

state positively if there had been any specific instance of use

of this material.

Seidel asked as to the possible effectiveness of

anonymous letters and he was informed that in the opinion

of the former Agent,

such letters, particularly having to

do with personal infidelity or thievery, which were the

usual suggested avenues, would have little effect on the

recipients who were active in such fields themselves much

of the time.

In the more serious areas of perhaps trying

to falsely show that an individual was an FBI or police

informant, the former Special Agent said that the use of

this technique would not be used for fear of causing bodily

harm or death to an innocent person due to the well-known

propensity of the BPP of dealing harshly with any suspected

deviator let alone informant.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked as to the value of ELSUR to

the BPP investigation and the former Special Agent stated

that in his belief it was extremely valuable in many ways.

For instance, it assisted

and

gauged the true Huey Newton,

his plans, and weaknesses.

It was also valuable in esti-

mating the possible effect of a certain COINTEL program

as possibly suggested by some other office.

As a result

of their information, the San Francisco Office usually

rejected most

suggestions as being unlikely to be successful.

Seidel wondered if ELSUR was not the most

valuable, single investigative aid that the Bureau had hac

in this investigation, and the former Special Agent agreed

that he was probably correct.

Seidel then wondered if the COINTEL proposals)

should be part of some legislation proposed by Congress

and the former Special Agent replied that the Bureau

officials, in his opinion, should be allowed to comment

on this because the fact that the program would be ineffective

against the BPP might not be a valid argument that it would

not work to better advantage in other circumstances.

Former Special Agent Cohendet declined to

comment on the effectiveness of COINTEL as used against

the socialist Workers Party, not having had any experience

with its use in that field.

Seidel then asked about informants and asked if

there had been any pressure from the Bureau in the develop-

ment of such sources.

Former Special Agent Cohendet

acknowledged that there certainly had been great pressure

in this direction, as it was well known that informants were

a necessary part of any investigation and a police organi-

zation can never give up on this phase of its work no matter

how difficult the circumstances were in their development.

In the case of the BPP, the development of informants was

particularly difficult because of the fear that many persons

in the black community felt concerning the BPP as well as

the lack of desire to cooperate against another black

person.

Seidel asked about foreign funds being raised

and given to the BPP, and former Special Agent Cohendet

recalled that "Masai" Hewitt and others went to Sweden

and other countries where the BPP raised money on speech

making tours.

Seidel then asked about any investigation of

BPP funds and former Special Agent Cohendet said that it

was his recollection that investigation of BPP funds had

been undertaken through legal channels but he had no

personal knowledge of the investigation and declined to

go further into this field.

Seidel asked about referrals of Bureau information

'to the Internal Revenue Service and former Special Agent

Cohendet said that he had no personal knowledge of what

had been done in this direction.

Seidel then asked about the affair between

Actress Jean Seberg

and "Masai" Hewitt, which had appeared

Hollywood gossip column and had alleged that Seberg

had become pregnant by Hewitt.

Seidel said that the Los

Angeles Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had

admitted leaking this information to someone in the press.

Former Special Agent Cohendet knew that this

couple had been lovers for a brief period but denied any

knowledge of any leak to the press by either San Francisco

or Los Angeles.

Seidel asked if the former Agent thought that

leaking this type of information was appropriate. No

comment was offered as to this question.

Seidel, at the conclusion of the interview, said

that he had noted that the "faking" of police records as

suggested had never been undertaken and he observed that he

believed the COINTEL abuses were being overplayed by the

press. From what he

learned in interviews in San Francisco,

It seemed to him that the program had been mostly played

down and indeed, an independent judgment had been exercised

in the implementation of the program.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BA

SSC STAFF MEMBER

A general discussion of the BPP ensued in which

former Special Agent Cohendet reiterated the criminal

background and threatening attitude of many of the BPP

members, their mendacious ways, and their lack of credi-

bility in their public statements. The

former Special

Agent credited the news media with helping to build up

the BPP beyond its actual strength and influence.

Seidel asked about the former Agent's knowledge of

for the removal of former SAC Harry Morgan

"from San" -

Francisco. He said the only reason he was asking this

question was in order to avoid embarrassing former SAC

Morgan when he interviews him concerning his possible.-

knowledge of BPP activities sometime in the future. Former

Special Agent. Cohendet had no knowledge as to why

Mr. Morgan

was transferred.

In summation,

Seidel ventured the opinion that he

thought the ELSUR technique was far moré valuable in the

carrying out of the investigation of the BPP than the

COINTEL. Former Special Agent Cohendet had to agree

to the above observation.

Former Special Agent Cohendet was not advised

of any rights that he might have in declining to answer

any questions and Seidel said he was actually seeking

witnesses for a possible hearing

• in Washington, D.C.

He

stated that no names would be mentioned in any write-up

he would make concerning his interviews.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

San Francisco, California

August 13, 1975

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 12 1975 retired former SA David E. Toda

was

interviewed from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. by Lester B. Seidel,

Investigator for the SSC.

The interview took place at the

Holiday Inn, San Francisco.

By way of background, in'all contacts with Seidel

previously, former SA Todd has

indicated to him great reluctance

to discuss

these matters without clearance from the Bureau,

and pointed out to Seidel that the Bureau had released former

SA Todd from the Employment Secrecy Agreement for the purpose

of a staff interview, but Seidel was told that former SA Todd

did not think it was

either his

responsibility or his prerogative

to provide information or make information public; that while

employed he was acting as an Agent of the Federal Government

and felt it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to

provide the information, and that if the Senate Committee

desired information from former SA Todd, the questions should

have been submitted to him in writing, and his answers should

have been made in writing and first forwarded to the FBI, and

in writing and

then after the FBI determined it advisable to make these answers

more can our a

available to the Committee, that would have been the proper

channel.

Seidel pointed out the Committee and the Bureau had

made an agreement whereby the Bureau would make Agents available

to the Committee for interview.

Former SA Todd pointed out to

Seidel that he is not in the category of an Agent, being a

retired Agent, and

at this point there was

• no additional discussion

on this matter.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of

the FBI.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel was also told that nothing that was said by

former SA Todd should be interpreted as being critical of

the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) itself, and that if

the Bureau felt that such a Program was necessary in the interest

of national defense, he had carried it out in the best way

he

saw fit, and that in

recommending against specific proposals

as being impractical or inadvisable, these recommendations were

against the specific incidents recommended and not against the

Program as a whole.

Seidel's first questions dealt with former SA Todd's

background and the extent of his Bureau service, and whether

he had worked security or criminal matters.

Former SA Todd

gave him chronologically the offices in which he had served

in the Bureau, and stated he had been associated from 1952 to

1956 with the Domestic Intelligence Division, Washington, D.C.,

and had become Supervisor in San Francisco in December, 1969,

of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and that during his Bureau

career

he had worked

both criminal and security matters.

Seidel asked the name of the squad which was originally

the

Racial Squad, and subsequently changed to Extremist Matters,

and he asked whether the work was strictly intelligence, or

whether it combined intelligence or criminal work. It was

pointed out Bombing Matters were originally being handled on

this Squad for a period of time, and that both the criminal

activities of the Panthers, as well as intelligence activities,

were combined in the assignment.

Seidel then asked when the technical surveillances on

the Panthers were installed. Former SA Todd replied that they

were functioning at the time he was appointed Supervisor.

Seidel

then asked how was the technical

surveillance related to the

COINTEL, if at all, and specifically whether information coming

from the technical

surveillance was used in carrying. out the

COINTEL.

Former SA Todd advised that he

could not recall

specifically what was done in either Program without reviewing

the

files and comparing the information therein with the source.

Seidel seemed very interested in this, but actually the question

could not be answered on the basis of recollection alone, and

was not.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked how would the Panther COINTEL

be defined with regard to aims, techniques and results.

The

answer to this was that the aims were to counter generally the

revolutionary objectives and activities of the Panthers.

The

question concerning techniques was left unanswered, and as

far as results go, former SA Todd told Seidel that he did not

feel there had been any great results from the Program as it was

pursued in the San Francisco Office, but he could not speak

for the rest of the Program as far as the Bureau is concerned.

Seidel asked whether the Agents working the criminal

aspects of the BPP received information that was received from

a technical

source, and he was told procedures by which

information had been routed to them in their cases, and that at

the time we operated these technical surveillances, we felt they

had been installed lawfully, and that the information received

could be used.

Seidel asked whether there was a great deal of pressure

put on the San Francisco Office for the development of informants.

He was told yes, that informants were the backbone of good law

enforcement and the Bureau constantly urged better informant

coverage.

Seidel asked if there had been similar pressure placed

on the office in the COINTEL, and former SA Todd replied that

he did not feel that any great pressure had been put on the

office to carry out this Program, but that the Bureau had recom-

mended the Program, however, had left it up to the office

pretty much as to how it should be carried out.

Seidel asked whether the Program had been successful

in causing dissention within the Party. Former SA Todd told

him that he did not feel this had been particularly effective

in any way, and that causing dissention had not been a primary

objective of the Program in the San Francisco Office, and that

the policy had been to use the Program for primarily two

purposes: 1) for the purpose of developing informants by

attempting to dissuade them from their loyalties to the Party;

and 2)

to make representations to Panthers for whom outstanding

arrest warrants had been issued in order to flush them out so

they could be apprehended.

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

-

Seidel asked specifically about the COINTEL involving

the Breakfast

Program, and was told a recommendation had been

made for putting some kind of .contamination in the Breakfast

Program food, and that this office had felt this extremely

inadvisable and recommended against it, and it was not carried

out here.

Former SA Todd was also asked

about a COINTEL

proposal relating to "The Black Panther" newspapers, and was

told that such a proposal had been made involving saturating

the papers with a foul smelling fish oil or some substance,

however, we recommended against this as it would serve no purpose.

Seidel was advised that the San Francisco policy had

been to recommend against harassment, per se,

and also recommended

against leaking information to the press. Seidel then raised

the question about the incident where Huey P. Newton's high

standard of living was given to the press, and he was told

that this fell into the category of informant development on

the basis it was felt that if those Panthers who

were living

practically in poverty could realize what Newton's standards

of living were, it might change their allegiênce to him and

they could be contacted for informant purposes.

Seidel was also told that in this phase of the

COINTEL, it was former SA Todd's recollection that this infor-

mation

regarding Newton's high standard of living had been

disseminated by informants, and that the press was well aware

of Newton's standards of living without having to make this

information available to them.

Seidel asked what the instructions had been from the

Bureau in carring out the COINTEL. Former SA Todd told Seidel

that he had reviewed this file after being appointed Supervisor,

but could not recall specifically what the Bureau instructions

were. The only other instructions received were at a two day

conference in Washington, D.C., on BPP matters conducted by

former Assistant to the Director William Sullivan, and Section

Chief George Moore, at which time it was pointed out that the

COINtEl to be coordinated with the Bureau,

but that former SA Todd did not recall any firm prohibition against

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

taking certain actions without Bureau authority, and that the

field had some leeway in what they did, but, in general, offices

made proposals to the Bureau with copies to San Francisco

prior to taking any action.

Seidel asked why San Francisco

got copies of all proposals, and was told this was because

San Francisco was office of origin in the BPP case and other

offices were required to

furnish a copy of all correspondence.

Seidel then asked to what extent Special Agent in

Charge Charles W. Bates had knowledge of the COINTEL as it

related to the BPP, and he was told that former SA Todd could

not speak for Bates

and his knowledge would be dependent upon

how carefully he read incoming mail and reviewed files, and

former SA Todd had no knowledge as to what extent Bates did this.

Seidel was told that under the supervisory setup in the

office at the time, former SA Todd felt it was his responsibility

100 a hat

to direct this Program in San Francisco and not Bates.

Seidel indicated that out of his investigation in the

hearings, undoubtedly there would be some legislation coming

out of Congress that would either enable of prohibit such

things as the COINTEL, and he stated that was one reason he

was asking concerning its effectiveness, and wondered what former

SA Todd would recommend.

Seidel was told that former SA Todd

felt it essential that

the Government should have the right to

defend itself against individuals and groups who advocate

violent revolution or who are aligned with foreign powers,

and that there was a need for some sort of legislation within

the framework of constitutional government which would enable

the government to do this; but, of course, it should be done

under proper control. Seidel asked for suggestions as to what

sort of control, and

was told that this was a matter for

Congress to decide, but perhaps Congress should look. into some

legislation similar to wiretap legislation, where the responsi

bility is upon a Federal judge to issue a warrant.

Former SA Todd had prepared a brief summary of what

he recalled of

the activities of the BPP, and he made a copy of

this available to Seidel.

Former SA Todd also had made a

chronology to assist him

in answering questions, together with

5

NW 55160 DocId: 32989641 Page 140

## Page 141

SSC:

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

some notes concerning COINTEL policy, former SA Todd's general

recollection of matters, questions of law regarding agent -

principle, privileged information problems, ongoing litigation

and national defense, and informants and sources.

Seidel asked

fOr

a copy of this chronology and this, too, was given to him.

Seidel expressed great interest in receiving the one

page summary of the Panthers' activities, and stated that he

had chosen the Panthers for a case study, and he seemed more

interested in this than in the COINTEL.

He also indicated that

there might be future interviews and that former SA Todd might

be called as a witness before the Committee at a later date.

At the outset of the interview, Seidel asked whether

former SA Todd desired his rights be read to him. Former

SA Todd told him that since he did not interpret this as a

custodial interview, and it was his understanding Seidel had no

police power, that he could forego reading the rights:

Former SA Todd did not feel it was necessary to

consult with a Bureau representative at this time.

The above information was furnished by former SA Todd

voluntarily and was not solicited.

The 'Inves

gation of the Black Panthes Party was a

National Defense matter.

Information on file points to colla-

boration with foreign powers by leaders of the party.

Throughout the two-year period in which I supervised

the Investigation there were strong liaisons between Black Panthers

and dissident groups abroad as well as with the governments of

foreign nations.

The Black Panthers had support and or branches

In France, Germany and Scandinavia, and were international in

Eldridge Cleaver, wanted on felony warrants, had been

granted asylum in Algeria and with his entourage was residing

in a villa provided by the Algerian government.

During this

period he made at least one trip to Moscow, Russia.

Several

Black Panthers travelled to Cuba.

Huey Newton, In

1971, travelled

Red China by way of Canada and Hong Kong at the invitation

the chinese government at a time when the united states nad

no aloonatic relations with them.

At the time I began serving as supervisor in late 1969,

the Black Panther Party was under co-leadership of Huey Newton,

then contined to prison in California, and Eldridge Cleaver, living.

In exile in Algeria.

The Black Panther Party, both in the news-

paper 1t published weekly at San Francisco, and in public statements

by its officers and leaders, advocated violent revolution; 1t

published instructions on guerrilla warfare, directions for the use

of weasons, and printed detailed drairings and instructions on

the manufacture of bombs and explosive devices, and 1t agitated

term "off the

which means

"kill the police," was a Black Panther catch-

phrase. The history of the Black Panther Party during the period

I acted as supervisor is replete rith incidents of murder, violence

and inciting to revolution.

The revolutionary quotation of Mao.

Ise-luag, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,"

became a

Black panther motto.

Sometime in early 1971 a solit occurred in the Black

Panther- Party.

Huey Newton, following his release fron prison

in 1970, gained control of one faction headquartered in Berkeley,

Califoria, and he broke openly with aldridge Cleaver, publicly

expelling Cleaver and Cleaver's lieutenants from the Party.

Newton faction thereaiter gradually took a more moderate approach,

advocating social change through community service in place of Its

prior profile of violence.

No change was noted in the policies of

the Cleaver faction directed from Algiers, and 1t continued to

advocate violent revolution; it began publication in New York

of its own newspaper proclaiming its revolutionary policies; ano

followers

belonging to this faction continued to commit crimes of

violence.

The following crimes of violence attributed to the Cleaver

faction of the Black panthers have been documented in the book "Target

Blue," by former Deputy Police Commissioner Robert Daley of New York

City

(De11 Publishing Co., Inc., 1973):

Ambush attacks against police officers which resulted in

T officers murdered, 3 wounded, and one attempted murder thwarted, which

led to the solution of the other cases and established these

attacks

to be

a nationwide conspiracy; and the murder of two Newton-faction

Black Panthers.

INTERVIEN OF SAC CHARLES W. BATES

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE /1/30/83 BYSA-2TAP/RBG

on the evening of August the 915, Mr. Lester Seidel.

and Mr. Loch Johnson, Staff Members of the Senate Select

Committee, met with Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

of the San Francisco Office.

This meeting occurred over dinner.

No statements were made by either of these individuals as to

any. rights that SAC Bates might have in connection with the

interview.

During the dinner, MI. Seidel referred to COINTELPRO

involving the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco, Bates advised him that he was in charge of

the San Francisco Office from July, 1967 until the end of

April, 1970, when he was transferred to Chicago.. Bates stated

that he was aware of the investigation being conducted

on the

Black Panther Party but was not personally conversant with

all the details of this

investigation as such details were

all contained in the FBI's file.

On at least two occasions

Mr. Seidel referred to specific facts occurring in other parts

of the country involving anonymous letters

sent to individuals

under COINTELPRO. He asked if Bates agreed that these actions

were proper.

MI. Seidel was told that Bates had no way of

knowing the

facts

as he related were true or any other of

the circumstances involved and that, therefore, he was unable

to comment at all.

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates had any recommendations

for legislation which the Committee

could propose that would

assist the FBI in the domestic counterintelligence field.

Bates informed him that he was not fully conversant with this

entire field and that it was the prerogative of FBI officials

•at Washington and Department of Justice officials to recommend

such legislation.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your

INTERVIEW OF SAC

CHARLES W. BATES

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Seidel also inquired as to whether Bates felt

that an extension of electronic surveillances into the domestic

intelligence field would be of assistance. Bates informed

him that the FBI was operating according to current court

decisions as involve electronic surveillances and that the

courts had recently precluded this action in strictly domestic

intelligence matters.

Mr. Seidel was informed that this was

a decision for FBI officials in Washington.

on several occasions during the evening, Mr. Johnson

asked

Bates if he was aware of the "Houston Plan.

On each

occasion Bates informed him that he was not aware of the

"Houston Plan" and his only knowledge of it is what he has

seen in the public press.

At one tine Mr. Johnson asked if

Bates

thought that MI. Hoover had

turned down the "Houston

Plan" because he was afraid for his. job. Bates again replied

that he had no firsthand knowledge having anything to do with

the "Houston Plan" but he was certainly aware that Mr. Hoover

was not afraid of anything or anyone.

Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt

that the use of "black bag jobs" would be of advantage in

conducting domestic counterintelligence operations.

Bates

replied that he had no personal direct knowledge of such matters

and had never been involved in such matters.

During the evening, Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt

that a congressional oversight committee of the FBI was sound

and proper.

Bates

informed that he certainly agreed with the

concept of congressional oversight as long as it was constructive

and not destructive.

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt that the

FBI'S

security operation should be completely divorced from

its criminal responsibilities and handled as a separate agency

or a separate part of the FBI.

Bates informed him that it

appeared that the FBI's efforts in both the criminal and the

security field had been effective and appeared to be proper

in its present context.

Mr. Seidel

inquired if Bates was

personally acquainted with Mr. William C. Sullivan, former

FBI official.

Mr. Seidel was informed that Bates worked in

the same division with Mr. Sullivan in the 1950's and knew

him as another supervisor at FBI Headquarters.

Seidel then asked if Bates was aware of the dis-

agreements that Mr. Sullivan had had with Mr. Hoover and he

was informed that he had no details concerning this matter.

INTERVIEW OF SAC

CHARLES W. BATES

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates knew former SAC Harry

Morgan.

Bates told him that he knew him as he had replaced

him as

SAC in San Francisco at the end of April, 1970..

then asked if Bates was aware of why Mi. Morgan

was transferred

from San Francisco.

Bates told him that some problem had

arisen in connection with his running the San Francisco Office

but that he was not personally aware of the specific details.

but that they would be available at FBI Headquarters.

Seidel

said the only reason he was asking was that he was thinking

about interviewing Mr. Morgan but he did not want to embarrass

him and then asked if Morgan's

transfer from San Francisco

had anything to do with a drinking problem.

Bates said again

that he was not aware of the specifics.

On the afternoon of August 13, 1975, Mr. Loch Johnson

came into the San Francisco FBI Office saying he had just a

few more questions he wanted to ask Bates.

He then asked if

the San Francisco Office was involved in foreign counter

intelligence work,

and he was informed that we were as were

many other FBI offices.

He then asked if we surveilled every-

one who went into or came out of the Soviet Consulate in San

Francisco.

He was informed that Bates did not intend to dis-

cuss with

him any investigative techniques or anything having

to do with pending investigations.

Mr. Johnson said he was

attempting to

find some individual who was an expert in foreign

counterintelligence, particularly the Soviet threat to the

United States.

Bates informed him that there were probably

a number of people in the United States who would qualify in

this category but Bates did not consider himself as an expert

in this field.

The above represents specific matters brought up

during these discussions.

BY

Prior to interview by SSC Staff Member, SA LEO S.

BRENNEISEN telephonically contacted SA DENNIS MILLER at

FBI Headquarters making four inquiries on Fugust 6, 1975;

on the same date, the following answers were received:

Is it permissible for agent to give general

answers concerning the Black Panther Party (BPP) as to

membership number and Chapter numbers at various dates?

Answer: Yes.

Local media has previously set forth a memorandum

purportedly from the FBI, San Francisco Office, suggesting

consideration should be

given to furnishing fabricated

documents originating with the Oakland Police Department

and the FBI, San Francisco, when, in fact, the memorandum

came from the Bureau.

If questioned concerning this memorandum,

may agent point out that this document originated with the

Bureau rather than San Francisco?

Answer: Yes.

In contemplation of possible questioning concerning

false correspondence directed to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and others

abroad, can agent refer SSC Staff to Bureau when questioned

concerning identity of agents preparing correspondence?

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

Is it necessary for agent to express an opinion

as to morality, legality of said Counterintelligence

Program (COINTEL) ?

Answer: You are not obliged to answer those

questions you do not desire to answer, but if you wish you

may comment on the legality or morality of the plan.

SA DENNIS MILLER related that he desired that it

be borne in mind that the Bureau in no way wished to impede

the SSC investigation.

LESTER B. SEIDEL, SSC Staff Member, appeared at the

'San Francisco Office of the FBI on August 11, 1975, and

interviewed :SA LEO BRENNEISEN from 1:03 PM to 2:30

SEIDEL prefaced the interview by explaining that he had

been advised that BRENNEISEN was the Coordinator for the

COINTEL in San Francisco from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1970.

It was pointed out to him that the case was assigned to

agent from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1971.

SEIDEL asked if agent had, in fact, approved all

proposals coming from

the San Francisco Office.

He was

advised that not necessarily because if another agent made

a proposal the person approving it in San Francisco would

be the person signing the outgoing mail, namely, the Supervisor

or Relief

• supeivisor.

:

SEIDEL asked what Squad agent had been assigned

to during this Program, and he was advised S-6.

He inquired

if there was any COINTEL in San Francisco against US; he

was advised to the contrary.

He inquired as to the usual

number of cases assigned agent, and was advised that to

agent's best recollection probably 30 at any one time. He

asked if agent's work was exclusively security during the.

handling of the COINTEL Program and he was advised agent

did have some criminal assignments.

He inquired if there

was

any relationship between COINTEL and criminal assignments,

and he was advised no and that agent desired to limit the

scope of his questioning to the COINTEL Program.

SEIDEL then asked how many suggestions the agent

had submitted in COINTEL. He was advised that an estimate

would be difficult but probably the nearest figure would be

some two suggestions a month with possibly six months in

two years when no suggestions were made.

He inquired as

to agent's knowledge of what percentage of total proposals

from all sources suomitted to the Bureau had been approved.

and he was advised only a small percentage.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

At this point, SEIDEL requested agent to outline the

types of COINTEL proposals submitted by San Francisco.

He

was answered that anonymous letters, letters with pseudonyms,

and letters signed with the name of an existing person had

been used.

It was pointed out that the program had included

the use of anonymous letters, including those directed to

landlords advising that the Black Panther Party was occupying

their property; letters to people supporting Bee programs,

including the Breakfast Program and enclosing copies of the

BPP color book for children encouraging the shooting of

police officers and/or articles from the "Black Panther

Party", the official BPP newspaper, showing their propensity

and advocacy of violence; letters

to organizations containing

articles that showed the

BPP in direct opposition to their

aims, such

as a letter to a Jewish organization showing BPP

support

of Palestine guerrillas.:

to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER in Algeria in the names of BPP members.

At this point, SEIDEL interrupted to explain that he was

enlisting the complete cooperation of the interviewee, that

there had been some Congressional criticisn of the COINTEL,

that there were some segments of the population that were

anti-FBI and that he desired to present the FBI in a proper

light, and that he had good friends in the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked, was it necessary to have utilized

COINTEL.

Agent aavised that it was difficult to correctly.

Juage the elect of the program but it was felt it was not

without some effect because the Black Panther Party had not

only dwindled from a membership of approximately 1,000 in

1969 to

perhaps 200 in 1973, but that the organization became

split with dissension and had dropped much of its former

advocacy for violence.

SEIDEL then requested that the agent give his

recommendation on what COINTEL in the future should be;

whether there should be a division between security and

criminal investigations to different agencies in order that

a possible intrusion on the rights of an individual in

intelligence matters might not necessarily preclude his

being prosecuted by the Bureau

in a criminal matter. Agent

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

refused to furnish his "off-thecuff" opinion, pointing

out that he felt that it was without the scope of his

release.

Without further questioning agent concerning the

types of COINTEL proposals, SEIDEL next asked if the

Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) on the BPP was in operation

at the time COINTEL was initiated, and what proposals were

submitted in COINTEL based on information from ELSUR.

SEIDEL was advised agent's release would not allow

him to discuss ELSUR.

SEIDEL asked if the San Francisco Division had made

any "snitch"

proposals.

When asked to clarify the question,

he stated that this was a suggestion to the effect that a

Black Panther Party member be accused of being an FBI

informant.

Agent replied that to the best of his recollection

no such recommendations had been made to the Bureau by San

Francisco, and on the contrary, agent knew that it had been

pointed out by San Francisco that any such allegation. should

be most carefully considered inasmuch as BPP history has

indicated that they had dealt severely with suspected infor-

mants, even to

the point of killing them.

SEIDEL then asked if the San Francisco Division

had received a great deal of "flak" from the Bureau on this

program.

He was advised that the Bureau operates a "tickler

system"

for following investigations and that the program

had received some priority from the FBI but agent had never

considered correspondence from the Bureau as being "flak"

SEIDEL at this

point instead of questioning made

the statement that the Bureau gave this matter "high priority".

No comment was made to this statement.

SEIDEL next questioned agent if he had read any

publicity concerning

a May 11, 1970 letter from the Bureau

- to San Francisco entitled, "Special Operations Research", in

which it was suggested that some consideration be given to

furnishing the BPP spurious documents that supposedly

originated with the Oakland Police Department and the FBI.

He explained that some newspaper had received a copy of the

document under the Freedom of Information Act and thereafter

published it. He inquired if

a response to the letter

## Page 152

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

had been made by San Francisco.

Agent advised that it was

his recollection that San Francisco had responded recommending

against both proposals, pointing out that the BEP had in the

short past published contingency plans of the Berkeley Police

Department for a raid on National Headquarters to the

embarrassment of that agency.

San Francisco was of the

opinion that if spurious documents were furnished to the

BPP they would immediately publish them, rather than attempt

to develop an informant and the operation presented a great

• deal of possible embarrassment and publicity for the Bureau.

-

SEIDEL asked for agent's knowledge of why the letter

h been captioned as previously described

Counterintelligence Program, Black Panther Party. Agent

stated he had no recollection of exact caption of the letter.

SEIDEL then went on to explain that he had been advised

the Bureau had several COINTELS and the one covering Special

Operations

a COINTEL covering foreign operations.

Agent made no comment.

SEIDEL requested what proposals had been made to

disrupt the BPP newspaper; how did the proposals originate,

and what offices submitted them. He was advised that it was

agent's

recollection that the Bureau may have requested

suggestions from several offices but that to agent's knowledge

none had been approved.

When SEIDEL continued to question the

agent concerning specific proposals and why their approval

was not recommended by San Francisco, he was

advised that one

proposal was

the use of a foul-smelling chemical to put on

damages. SEIDEL was further advised that it was believed

the suggestion may have been made for the changing of a first

page of an issue at the printing company to embarrass the BPP,

but it was pointed out that this would also merely result in

• a claim being filed against the printer.

SEIDEL was advised that there may have been a

suggestion that some thought should be given to the possible

delay of the plates for the paper,

that suggestion coming

at the time when the paper was being printed in New York

with the master copy being filmed in San Francisco. San

Francisco did not suggest approval because a mere delay would

have been of little benefit because the paper was not timely.•

The answer was given that agent had

that he believed not and that it probably happened in

San Diego.

SEIDEL asked about a suggestion that informants

rent from the BPP. Agent advised he had no recollection

of this, but could see nothing wrong in it.

SEIDEL inquired as to the amount of knowledge.

that SAC CHARLES BATES would have had concerning COINTEL.

He was advised that agent had no information, that he, himself,

had never discussed the program with Mr. BATES while it was

in operation. SEIDEL then inquired if former SAC HARRY

MORGAN had been ill during the time he was assigned to San

Francisco and the reason for his transfer.

Agent replied

he had no information concerning this matter.

SEIDEL was asked if he felt that anyof the actions

agent described as being taken by the San Francisco Division

were illegal. SEIDEL stated that he did not believe that

the war sata

these were matters that were in violation of any existing

criminal statutes, but there might be some question as to

whether the FBI had the specific authority to do these things.

SEIDEL ended the interview by again reiterating

that he was a friend of the Bureau, that he was making an

inquiry and

desired to obtain the opinions of both Headquarters

and agents in the field, and that he may make a request to the

Bureau to widen the scope of agent's release.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER (SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY

on August 13, 1975, Iormer Special Agent Albert P.

Clark, who was a

supervisor in the San Francisco FBI Office

and who retired in December of 1969, advised as follows:

He was interviewed in his home at 66 Elm,

Larkspur, California, by SSC Member Lester B. Seidel from

5:40 P.M. to 6:55 P.M., August 12, 1975.

Clark was not placed under oath and no mention

was made of his rights.

However, Seidel was pleasant and

in no way antagonistic. The interview was general, not

penetrative, not in depth, and very few specific questions were

asked.

There appeared to be no discernible criticism of

either the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) or the

Bureau's investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) by

Seidel.

Seidel was compelled on more than one occasion

to declare that he was pro-FBI, that the object of his

inquiries was to assist the United States Senate in under-

standing the problem in order that they could consider

possible legislation that may eliminate any abuses in the

future.

Seidel did mention the fact several times that

information had been leaked to the press that Jane seberg,

the movie actress, had become pregnant by a BPP official.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel finally asked Clark if he would have okayed

a COINTEL proposal like this and he answered that he would

have if he felt that it would have sufficiently hindered

the BPP, stating that possibly in some of these occasions

someone

might get hurt but on the other hand, investigation

of the BPP by the FBI might be made easier and it might

also cut down on the number of BPP supporters.

Clark was asked to whom the main BPP

case was

assigned and to whom COINTEL had been assigned in the San

Francisco Division.

Clark replied that he did not remember

but possibly during the time of his supervision, more than

one Agent had handled the matters.

Seidel asked how many BPP informants the San

Francisco Division had. Clark replied he did not recall

and::? he did not believe that seidel had a right to know.

Seidel inquired about the BPP wiretap,, asking

who had requested the tap, the Bureau or the San Francisco

Division.

Again, Clark replied that he did not recall but

the San Francisco Division would not have necessarily

waited for the Bureau to initiate the matter but might have

requested the Bureau rather than the Bureau having initiated

the matter.

Seidel wanted to have an example of a coINtEL

proposal.

He was not given a speclilc example but general

conversation was had to the effect that any move that might

be suggested that would aid the San Francisco Division in

their investigation of the BPP in determining their

supporters and financiers and possibly disenchanting those

individuals might be an example.

Seidel did not ask Clark whether he had done a

particular thing.

Questioned concerning whether he felt COINTEL had

been effective, Clark replied he did not believe the matter

susceptible to proof but the BPP had sure gone into a

steep decline.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel again brought up the Seberg matter and

asked if it had done any good. Clark stated he replied,

"Maybe."

During this conversation, Clark got the general

impression that perhaps Seidel did not feel that COINTEL

had been necessary but Clark had argued that it had made

the BPP

more difficult to operate and possibly easier

for the FBI to investigate.

Seidel then wanted to know what there was about

the BPP that caused such a concentration of FBI investi-

gative attention.

Clark pointed out that this would have

to be answered in the context of time, that at the time the

program was initiated, there was no doubt that the BPP

was

a violent, racist

organization opposing all law enforce-

ment, attacking officers and

generally disturbing the

tranguility of the community.

Seidel then went on

to discuss the business of

pressure. Had Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

and the Bureau put too much pressure on the matter?

Clark

stated there was undoubtedly pressure because everyone

was interested in doing the best type job possible and

finding out everything possible concerning the BPP.

There

was obvious pressure from the Bureau in the matter

and the

Bureau, in a case like this, could never be satisfied.

Clark

stated that he related that perhaps too much

pressure had come from the Bureau because he had felt at

the time he was a

supervisor that San Francisco Division

knew more about the BPP than the Bureau.

On the other

hand, he related that Bureau officials were

probably

under pressure because of the national interest and the

demands on them in Washington.

Seidel related that he was interested in ascer-

taining what Agent would make the best witness to appear

in Washington to explain and testify concerning COINTEL.

He specifically requested Clark's recommendation and mentioned

the names of Special Agents Leo S. Brenneisen of San

Francisco and Bob Baker of Los Angeles.

Clark stated that

he had countered by suggesting that somebody in Washington

who directed the program and approved all proposals might

Clark recalled that near the first of the inter-

view, Seidel probably, more to make conversation than to

obtain information, asked a few questions concerning US

and the Republic of North Africa (RNA) •

He was advised

that US had not been active in this division and there had

been no pertinent RNA activity brought to his attention.

Seidel asked if Ron Karenga of US had visited San Francisco

and Clark replied he had no exact recollection of this.

Seidel talked and asked Clark's opinion on the

separation into different agencies of the Bureau's criminal

and security investigations.

Clark stated that he told

Seidel that in the past he had considered this and felt that

frankly it might have advantages, and at the same time,

might have disadvantages.

disadvantages were that you could not be sure that it, in

fact, would work and that if you remove the security

investigations from the Bureau, you would undoubtedly

lose a great deal, including public support.

Seidel asked if Clark had worked under former

SAC Harry Morgan.

He advised that he had retired prior to

the time Morgan was assigned to the San Francisco Division.

Clark pointed out that during the interview, a

recorder appeared prominently on his desk, and Seidel

could, of course, not be sure that it was not in operation;

although as the duration of the interview lengthened, it

must have been obvious to Seidel that it was not operating.

Mr. Seidel mentioned that he was serving as a

He stated that he was hoping for full

He was advised that former Special Agent Cohendet

was willing. to cooperate with the committee and he trusted

that something constructive would come out of the effort

being put forward. Former Special Agent. Cohendet also

pointed out that in his opinion the Black Panther Party (BPP)

The former Special Agent replied that he was

not party to any of these arrangements and did not know

any of the details.

Seidel then asked if former Special Agent

Cohendet knew the origin and purposes of the COINTEL

Program. He was informed that the

former Agent did not

know the origin of the program, and said he believed'its

purposes were those as set forth in the instructions which

Seidel had and which spoke for themselves. The former

Agent admitted that said program at one time had been

assigned to him but due. to the press of other functions,

he had been unable to give it a great deal of time and

felt that during the period that it had been assigned to

him, it had been largely ineffective.

Seidel then asked if there was any connection

between ELSUR and COINTEL and the reply was given that

obviously there would be if the ELSUR material being

reviewed could be considered as having any pertinence to.

a COINTEL operation.

However, former Special Agent Cohendet

could not recall having used this material while the case

was assigned to him, at least to any significant degree.

Not having the files available made it impossible to

state positively if there had been any specific instance of sc

of this material.

Seidel asked as to the possible effectiveness of

anonymous letters and he was informed that in the opinion

of the former Agent,

such letters, particularly having to

do with personal infidelity or thievery, which were the

usual. suggested avenues, would have little effect on the

• recipients who were active in such fields themselves much

of the time. In the more serious areas of perhaps trying

to falsely show that an individual was an FBI or police

informant,

the former Special Agent said that the use of

this technique would not be

propensity of the BPP of dealing harshly with any suspected.

Seidel then asked as to the value of ELSUR to

the BPP investigation and the former Special Agent stated

that in his belief it was extremely valuable in many ways.

For instance, it assisted and gauged the true Huey Newton,

his plans, and weaknesses. It was also valuable in esti-

• mating the possible effect of a certain COINTEL program

as possibly suggested by some other office. As a result

of their information,

the San Francisco Office usually

rejected most

suggestions as being unlikely to be successful.

Seidel wondered if ELSUR was not the most

valuable, single investigative ald that the Bureau had had

in this investigation, and the former Special Agent agreed

that

Seidel then wondered if the COINTEL proposals

should be part of some legislation proposed by Congress

and the former Special Agent replied that the Bureau

officials, in his opinion, should be allowed to comment

on this because the fact that the program would be ineffective

against the BPP might not be a valid argument that it would

not work to better advantage in other circumstances.

Former Special Agent Cohendet declined to

comment on the effectiveness. of COINTEL as used against

the Socialist Workers Party, not having had any experience

with its use in that field.

Seidel then asked about informants and asked if

there had been any pressure from the Bureau in the develop-

ment of such sources.

Former Special Agent Cohendet

acknowledged that there certainly had been great pressure

in this direction, as it was well known that informants were

a necessary part of any investigation and a police organi-

zation can never give up on this phase of its work no matter

how difficult the circumstances were in their development.

In the case of the BPP, the development of informants was

particularly difficult because of the fear that many persons

in the black community felt concerning the BPP as well as

the lack of desire to cooperate against another black

person.

Seidel asked about foreign funds being raised

and tormer spectal Agent Conendet

Hewitt and others went to. Sweden

and other countries where the BPP raised money on speech

making tours.

Seidel then asked about any investigation of

BPP funds and former Special Agent Cohendet said that it

was his recollection that investigation of BPP funds had

been undertaken through legal channels but he had no

personal knowledge of the investigation and declined to

go further into this field.

Seidel asked about referrals of Bureau information

to the Internal Revenue Service and former Special Agent

Cohendet said that he had no personal knowledge of what

had been done in this direction.

Seidel then asked about the affair between

Actress Jean Seberg

and "Masai" Hewitt, which had appeared

in a Hollywood gossip column and had alleged that Seberg

had become pregnant by Hewitt. Seidel said that the Los

Angeles Office of the

Federal

Bureau of Investigation had

admitted leaking this information to someone

in the press.

Former Special Agent Cohendet knew that this

couple had been lovers for a brief period but denied any

knowledge of any leak to the press by either San Francisco

or Los Angeles.

Seidel asked if the former Agent thought that

leaking this type of information was appropriate.

NO

comment was offered as to this question.

seidel, at the conclusion of the interview, said

that he had noted that the "faking" of police records as

suggested had never been undertaken and he observed that he

believed the COINTEL abuses were being overplayed by the

press.

From what he learned in interviews in San Francisco,

it seemed

to him that the program had been mostly played

down and indeed, an independent judgment had been exercised

in the implementation of the program.

U.S: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

A general discussion of the BPP ensued in which

former Special Agent Cohendet reiterated the criminal

background and threatening attitude of many of the BPP

members, their mendacious ways, and their lack of creai-

bility in their public statements.

The

former Special

Agent credited the news media with helping to build up

the BPP beyond its actual strength and influence.

Seidel asked about the former Agent's knowleäge of the reason

for the removal of former SAC Harry Morgan from San

Francisco.

He said the only reason he was asking this

question

was in order to avoid embarrassing former SAC

Morgan when he interviews him concerning his possible

knowledge of BPP activities sometime in the future. Former

Special Agent Cohendet had no knowledge as to why

Mr. Morgan was transferred.

In sunnation,

Seidel ventured the opinion that he

thought the ELSUR technique was far moré valuable in the

carrying out of the investigation of the BPP than the

COINTEL. Former Special Agent Cohendet had to agree

to the above observation.

Former Special Agent Cohendet was not advised

of any rights that he might have in declining to answer

any questions and Seidel said he was actually seeking

witnesses for a possible hearing in Washington, D.C.

He

stated that no names would be mentioned in any write-up

he would make concerning his interviews.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA DAVID E. TODD

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 12, 1975, retired former SA David E. Todd

was interviewed from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. by Lester B. Seidel,

Investigator for the SSC.

The interview took place at the

Holiday Inn, San Francisco.

By way of background,

in all contacts with Seidel

previously, former SA Todd has

indicated to him great reluctance

to discuss

these matters without clearance from the Bureau,

and pointed out to Seidel that the Bureau had released former

SA Todd from the Employment Secrecy Agreement for the purpose

of a staff interview, but Seidel was told that former SA Toda

did not think it was either his responsibility or his prerogative

to provide information or make information public; that while

employed he was acting as an Agent of the Federal Government

and felt it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to

provide the information, and that. if the Senate Committee

desired information from

former SA Todd, the questions should

have been submitted to him in writing, and his answers should

have been made in writing and first forwarded to the FBI, and

then after the FBI determined it advisable to make these

answers

available to the Committee, that would have been the proper

channel.

Seidel pointed out the Committee and the Bureau had

made an agreement whereby the

Bureau would make Agents available

to the Committee for interview.

Former sa lodd pointed out to

Seidel that he is not in

the category of an Agent, being a

retired Agent, and at this point there was no additional discussion

on this matter.

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel was also told that nothing that was said by

former SA Todd should be interpreted as being critical of

the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) itself, and that if

the Bureau felt that such a Program was necessary in the interest

of national defense, he had carried it out in the best way he

saw fit,

and that in recommending against specific proposals

as being impractical or inadvisable, these recommendations were

against the specific incidents recommended and not against the

Program as a whole.

Seidel's first questions dealt with former SA Todd's

background and the extent of his Bureau service, and whether

he had worked security or criminal matters.

Former SA Toda

gave him chronologically the offices in which he had served

in the Bureau, and stated he had been associated from 1952 to

1956 with the

Domestic Intelligence Division, Washington, D.C.,

and had become Supervisor in San Francisco in December, 1969,

of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and that during his Bureau

career he had worked both criminal and security matters.

Seidel

asked the name of the squad which was originally

the Racial Squad, and subsequently changed to Extremist Matters,

and he asked whether the work was strictly intelligence, or

whether it combined

intelligence or criminal work.

It was

pointed out Bombing Matters were originally being handled on

this Squad for a period of time, and that both the criminal

activities of the Panthers, as well as intelligence activities,

were combined in the assignment.

Seidel then asked when the technical surveillances on

the Panthers were installed. Former SA Todd replied that they

were functioning at the time he was appointed Supervisor. Seidel

then asked how was

the technical surveillance related

to the

COINTEL, if at all, and specifically whether information coming

from the technical surveillance was used in carrying out the

COINTEL.

Former SA Todd advised that he could not recall

specifically what was done in either Program without reviewing

the files and comparing the information therein with the source.

Seidel seemed very interested in this, but actually the question

could not be answered on the basis of recollection alone, and

was

not.

SSC;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked how would the Panther COINTEL

be defined with regard to aims, techniques and results. The

answer to this was that the aims were to counter generally the

revolutionary objectives and activities of the Panthers.

The

question concerning techniques was left unanswered, and as

far as results go, former SA Todd told Seidel that he did not

feel there had been any great results from the Program as it was

pursued in the San Francisco Office, but he could not speak

for the rest of the Program as far as the Bureau is concerned.

Seidel asked whether the Agents working the criminal

aspects of the BPP received information that was received from

a technical source, and he was told procedures by which

information had been routed to them in their cases, and that at

the time we operated these technical surveillances, we felt they

had been installed lawfully, and that the information received

could be used.

Seidel asked whether there was a great deal of pressure

put on the San Francisco Office for the development of informants.

He was told yes, that informants were the backbone of good law

enforcement and the Bureau constantly urged better informant

coverage.

Seidel asked if there had been similar pressure placed

on the office in the COINTEL, and former SA Todd replied that

he did not feel that any great pressure had been put on the

office to carry out this Program, but that the Bureau had recom

mended the Program, however, had left it up to the office

pretty much as to how it should be carried out.

Seidel asked whether the Program had been successful

in causing dissention within the Party. Former SA Todd told

him that he did not feel this had been particularly effective

in any

way, and that causing dissention had not been a primary

objective of the Program in the San Francisco Office, and that

the policy had been to use the Program for primarily two

purposes: 1) for the purpose of developing informants by.

attempting to dissuade them from their loyalties to the Party;

and 2) to make representations to Panthers for whom outstanding

arrest warrants had been issued in order to flush them out so

they could be apprehended.

the Breakfast Program, and was told a recommendation had been

made for putting some kind of contamination in the Breakfast

Program food, and that this office had felt this extremely

inadvisable and recommended against it, and it was not carried

out here.

Former SA Todd was also asked about a COINTEL

proposal relating to "The Black Panther" newspapers, and was

told that such a proposal had been made involving saturating

the papers with a foul smelling fish oil or some substance,

however, we recommended against this as it would serve no purpose.

Seidel was advised that the San Francisco policy had

been to recommend against harassment, per se, and also recommended

against leaking information to the press. Seidel then raised

the question about the incident where Huey P. Newton's high

standard of living was given to the press, and he was told

that this fell into the category of informant development on

the basis it was felt that if those Panthers who

were living

practically in poverty could realize what Neyton's standards

of living were, it might change their allegience to him and

• they could be contacted for informant purposes.

Seidel was also told that in this phase of the

COINTEL, it was former SA Todd's recollection that this infor-

mation regarding

Newton's high standard of living had been

disseminated by informants, and that the press was well aware

of Newton's standards of living without having to make this

information available to them.

Seidel asked what the instructions had been from the

Bureau in carring out the COINTEL.

Former SA Todd told Seidel

that he had reviewed this file after being appointed Supervisor,

but could not recall specifically what the Bureau instructions

The only other instructions received were at a two day

vonference in Washington, D.C., on BPP matters conducted by

former Assistant to the Director William Sullivan, and Section

Chief George Moore, at which time it was pointed out that the

Bureau desired the COINTEL to be coordinated with the Bureau,

but that former SA Todd did not recall any firm prohibition against

taking certain actions without Bureau authority, and that the

field had some leeway in what they did, but, in general, offices

made proposals

to the Bureau with copies to San Francisco

prior to taking any action. Seidel asked why San Francisco

got copies of all proposals, and was told this was because

San

Francisco was office of origin in the BPP case and other

offices were required to furnish a copy of all correspondence.

Seidel then asked to what extent Special Agent in

Charge Charles W. Bates had knowledge of the COINTEL as it

related to the BPP, and he was told that former SA lodd could

not speak for Bates and his knowledge would be dependent upon

how carefully he read incoming mail and reviewed files, and

former SA Todd had no knowledge as to what extent Bates did this.

Seidel was told that under the

supervisory setup in the

office at the time, former SA Todd felt it was his responsibility

to direct this Program in San Francisco and not Bates.

Seidel indicated that out of his investigation in the

hearings, undoubtedly there would be some legislation coming

out of Congress that would either enable or prohibit such

things as the COINTEL,

and he stated that was one reason he

was asking concerning

its effectiveness, and wondered what former

SA Todd would recommend.

Seidel was told that former SA Todd

felt it essential that the Government should have the right to

defend itself against individuals and groups who advocate

violent revolution or who are aligned with foreign powers,

and that there was a need for some sort of legislation within

the framework of constitutional government which would enable

the government to do this; but, of course, it should be done

under. proper control. Seidel asked for suggestions as to what

sort of control, and was told that this was a matter for

Congress to decide, but perhaps Congress should look into some

legislation similar to wiretap legislation, where the responsi-

bility is upon a

Federal judge to issue a warrant.

Former SA Todd had prepared a brief summary of what

he recalled of the activities of the BPP, and he made a copy of

this available to Seidel.

Former SA Todd also had made a

chronology to assist him in answering questions, together with

recollection of matters, questions of law regarding agent -

and national defense, and informants and sources.

Seidel

asked

for a copy of this chronology and this, too, was given to him.

Seidel expressed great interest in receiving the one

page summary of the Panthers' activities, and stated that he

had chosen the Panthers for a case study, and he seemed more

interested in this than in the COINTEL.

there might be future interviews and that former SA Todd might

be called

as a

witness

before the Committee at a later date.

At the outset of the interview, Seidel asked whether

former SA Todd desired his rights be read to him. Former

SA Todd told him that since he did not interpret this as a

custodial interview, and it was his understanding Seidel had no

police power, that he could forego reading the rights.

Former SA Todd did not feel it was necessary to

consult with a Bureau representative at this time.

The above information was furnished by former SA Todd

voluntarily and was not solicited.

dividuals. to whom we have incurred an obligation to protecting

their identity and/or relationship with the FBI as related to

COINTELPRO documents. Prior to furnishing copies of Bureau

documents relating to COINTELPRO, we were excising the iden-

tities of individuals to whom we

protect their identity and/or relationship with the FBI and the

Committee complained that this was not in line with

the agreed

• upon procedures.

Pursuant to the instructions of the Deputy. Attorney

General, an attempt was made at reaching a compromise concerning

this matter.

As part of the compromise, it was suggested that

a certain number of these individuals whose name had been deleted

be furnished to the Senate Select Committee representatives for

their interview by the Committee.

As a result of the preliminary discussions, SA Daly

of this Division was advised on 8/15/75 by Steven Blackhurst

that the Attorney General had met with Senator Church on the

• evening of 8/14/75 and Church had agreed that the Committee

would attempt a limited number of interviews of people whose

identities and/or relationship with the Bureau had been pro-

tected.

to be allowed to contact the proposed interviewees to inform

them of the proposed interview to determine whether the inter-

viewee was receptive to such

an interview.

The Bureau's attention is directed to Bureau file

170-3281.

Subject of this file is known to the Bureau and

was opened by the Jackson Office 6/18/68, as a Confidential

source - racial,

and case was closed by Jackson letter to the

Bureau, dated 9/12/69. During the period that the case was

open, this source was paid by this Bureau a total of $392.

At the time this subject was developed as a confidential

source, it was the distinct understanding between source and

Agents

contacting him that all information furnished by him

would be held in strict confidence and the revelation of

information furnished by him would most assuredly result in

his, as' well as other members of his family, immediate death.

This Bureau has never violated that trust.

GORDON LESTER GLARK

The indices of the Jackson Office revealed no

information furnished by this individual for period

5/1/68-8/31/68.

The Bureau's attention is directed to Bureau file

170-5883.

Subject of this file is known to the Bureau and

was opened by the Jackson Office January 4, 1972.

This source's identity has never been publicly

disclosed. Informant was sole source of information in the

proposed bombing by BYRON DE LA BECKWITH of the residence

Of A. I. BOINICK, head of the Anti-Defamation League in

Louisiana and Mississippi, on or about september 41, 19/3. It

is noted that during

Federal and state trials, lasting approxi-

mately 22 years, that it appeared the primary function of the

defendants and their klan-type lawyers

was to determine the

identity of informant in this case.

Efforts were directed at

handling Agent on numerous occasions in an effort to have him

make some slip which would reveal identity of informant.

Numerous Federal court decisions were utilized and, in fact,

Agent was excused by State Judge from testifying since he was

convinced that any testimony in state court by the Agent would

reveal source's identity and possibly cost him his life.

In view of the above, the Bureau should make every

affort to insure source's identity is not disclosed.

It was his address at time he retired several years ago in

We subsequently learned that Cox has a mailing address

of a trailer court in Sarasota, Florida, and that he was

currently on a lengthy motor trip, exact current whereabouts

unknown. By teletype 8/26/75, we instructed Tampa to make

necessary arrangements through the trailer court to eventually

be in touch with Cox so he might be alerted that the SSC might

contact him for an interview.

On the afternoon of 8/26/75, Cox telephonically

contacted Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the SENSTUDY 75 Project

from Washington, D. C. He indicated that he had been visiting

the area the last couple of days in connection with a long trip

he had taken through Canada and the Midwest, and had learned

through a mutual acquaintance who is also employed in the

Intelligence Division and has been assisting on the SENSTUDY 75

Project and thus knew of our current interest in Cox, that the

Bureau was attempting to locate Cox. Phillips briefed Cox in

the same manner as he would have been briefed had the Tampa

Office been able to contact him.

He indicated that if he was

eventually is interviewed he would certainly want to tell the

Bureau the results of the interview. In addition to the

trailer court address we have on

record, Cox furnished an

address where he is more apt to be located, which is also a

trailer court.

That address is number 353, 1300 South Airport

Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32910, telephone area code

305, 724-4104. Nothing was said to Cox concerning the

consultation aspects relating to interviews of former Agents,

as this is a matter under current study with possible change

in procedure to be effected.

In view of the conversation had with Cox on the

afternoon of 8/26/75, Phillips telephonically contacted

ASAC, John Beale

of the Tampa Office and advised

him that no action need be taken by the Tampa Office in

attempt to locate Cox, as this has already been handled by

FBIHQ as above.

None. For information.

ADEX should be changed to include the new alias and

since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,

for the Monterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested

that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue

Early in the evening of July 2, a 4-year-old girl

named Joyce Ann Huff was shot to death as sho played

in a yard in Hawaian Gardens. She was hit with 42

shotgun pellets fired from a passing car. Subsequently,

thres Chicano youthis from the neighboring Norwalks

that my boy killed a child."

Beatrice Antelo was sitting at her kitchen table,

staring listiessly at a cold cup of coffee in front of

her, her voice a weary whisper.

"They didn't have uniforms on, so I thought

maybe they were some of Don's friends playing a

bad joke. I told them to stop fooling around about,

something so awful."

Though it was nearly noon now, Beatrice Antelo

still wore her houserobe and slippers. Her small

kitchen was half lost in the stagnant gloom of

drawn shades and closed windows.

"I said no, it was impossible. Not my son. He

BYSPZALM C

On the evening of August 11, 1975, MI. Lester Seidel

Committee, met with Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

of the San Francisco Office.

This meeting occurred over dinner.

No statements were made by either of these individuals as to

interview.

During the dinner, Mr. Seidel referred to COINTELPRO

involving the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco. Bates advised him that he was in charge of

the San Francisco Office from July, 1967 until the end of

April, 1970, when he was transferred to Chicago.

Bates stated

he was aware of the investigation being conducted on the

Black Panther Party but was not personally conversant with

all the details of this

investigation as such details were

all contained in the FBI's file.

on at least two occasions

Mr. Seidel referred to specific

facts occurring in other parts

of the country involving anonymous letters

sent to individuals

under COINTELPRO. He asked if Bates agreed that these actions

were proper.

Mr.. Seidel was

told that Bates had no way of

knowing the

facts

as he related were true or any other of

the circumstances involved and that, therefore, he was unable

to comment at all.

for

Mt. Seidel asked if Bates had any recommendations

legislation which the Committee. could propose that would

assist the FBI in the domestic counterintelligence field.

Bates informed him that he was not fully conversant with this

entire field and that it was the prerogative of FBI officials

• at Washington and Department of Justice officials to recommend

such legislation.

of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your

BY SSC. STAFF. MEMBERS.

Mr. Seidel also inquired as to whether Bates felt

that an extension of electronic surveillances into the domestic

intelligence field would be of assistance. Bates informed

him that the fBI was operating according to current court

decisions as involve electronic surveillances and that the

courts had recently precluded

this action in strictly domestic

intelligence matters.

Mr. Seidel was informed that this was

a decision for fBI officials in washington.

On several occasions during the evening, Mr. Johnson

Bates if he was aware of the "Houston Plan."

On each

occasion Bates informed him that he was not

aware of the

"Houston Plan" and his only knowledge of it is what he has

seen in the public press.

At one time Mr. Johnson

asked if

Bates

thought that Mr. Hoover had turned down the

"Houston

Plan" because he was afraid for his job. Bates again replied

that he had no firsthand knowledge having anything to do wich

"Houston Plan" but he was certainly aware that Mi. Hoover

was not afraid of anything or anyone.

Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt

that the use of "black bag jobs" would be of advantage ir

conducting domestic counterintelligence operations.

Bates

-replied that he had no personal direct knowledge of such matters

and had never been involved in such matters.

During the evening, MI. Seidel asked if Bates felt

that a congressional oversight committee of the fBi was souno

and proper. Bates

informed that he certainly

agreed with the

concept of congressional oversight as long as it was constructive

and not destructive. Mr. Seidel asked if Bates felt that the

FBI's security operation should be completely. divorced from

its criminal responsibilities and handled as a separate agency

or a separate part of the FBI.

Bates informed him that it

appeared that the FBI's efforts in both the criminal and the

security field had been effective and appeared to be proper

in its present context.

Mr. Seidel inquired if Bates was

personally acquainted with Mr. William C. Sullivan, former

FBI official.

Mr. Seidel was informed that Bates worked in

the same division with Mr. Sullivan in the 1950's and knew

him as another supervisor at FBI Headquarters.

Seidel then asked if Bates was aware of the dis-

agreements that Mr. Sullivan had had with Mr. Hoover and he

was informed that he had no details concerning this matter.

INTERVIEW OF SAC

CHARLES W. BATES

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Seidel asked if Bates knew former SAC HarIY

Morgan.

Bates told him that he knew him as he had replaced

him as

SAC in San Francisco at the end of April, 1970.

then asked if Bates was aware of why Mr. Morgan

was transferred

from San Francisco. Bates told him that some problem had

arisen in connection with his running the San Francisco Office

but that they would

be available at FBI Headquarters.

said the only reason he was asking was that he was thinking

about interviewing Mi. Morgan but he did not want to embarrass

him and then asked if Morgan's transfer from San Francisco

Bates said again

that he was not aware of the specifics.

On the afternoon of August 13, 1975, Mr. Loch Johnson

came into the San Francisco FBI Office saying he had just a

few more quastions he wanted to ask Bates.

He then asked if

the San Francisco Office was involved in foreigh counter-

intelligence work,

and he was informed that we were as were

many other FBI offices.

He then asked if we surveilled every-

one who went into or came out of the Soviet Consulate in San

Francisco.

He was informed that Bates did not intend to dis~

cuss with

him any investigative techniques or anything having

to do with pending investigations.

Mr. Johnson said he was

attempting to find some individual who was an expert in foreign

counterintelligence, particularly the Soviet threat to the

Bates intormed him that there were probably

a number of people in the United States who would qualify in

this category but Bates did not consider himself as an expert

during these discussions.

Prior to interview by SSC Staff Member, SA LEO S,D

BRENNEISEN telephonically contacted SA DENNIS MILLER at

FBI Headquarters making four inquiries on Lugust 6, 1975;

on the same date, the following answers were received:

Is it permissible for agent to give general

answers concerning the Black Panther Party (BPP) as to

membership number and Chapter numbers at various dates?

Answer: Yes. '

Local media has previously set forth a memorandum

purportedly from. the FBI, San Francisco Office, suggesting

consideration should be given to furnishing fabricated

documents

originating with the Oakland Police Department

and the FBI, San Francisco, when, in fact, the memorandum

came from the Bureau.

If questioned concerning this memorandum,

may agent point out that this document originated with the

Bureau rather than San Francisco?

Answer: Yes.

In contemplation of possible questioning concerning

false correspondence directed to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and others

abroad, can agent refer SSC Staff to Bureau when questioned

concerning identity of agents preparing correspondence?

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

Is it necessary for agent to express an opinion

as to morality, legality of said Counterintelligence

Program (COINTEL) ?

Answer: You are not obliged to answer those

questions you do not desire to answer, but if you wish you

may

comment on the legality of morality of the plan.

SA DENNIS MILLER related that he desired that it

be borne

in mind that the Bureau in no way wished to impede

the SSc investigation.

LESTER B. SEIDEL, SSC Staff Member, appeared at the

'San Francisco Office of the FBI on August 11, 1975, and

interviewed SA LEO BRENNEISEN from 1:03 PM to 2:30

SEIDEL prefaced the interview by explaining that he had

been advised that BRENNEISEN was the Coordinator for the

COINTEL in San Francisco from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1970.

It was pointed out to him that the case was assigned to

agent from May 16, 1969 to May 1, 1971.

SEIDEL asked if agent had, in fact, approved all

proposals coming from the San Francisco Office.

He was

advised that not necessarily because if another agent made

a proposal the person approving it in San Francisco would

be the person signing the outgoing mail, namely, the Supervisoi

or Relief Supervisor.

SEIDEL asked what Squad agent had been assigned

to during this Program, and he was advised S-6. He inquired

if there was any 'COINTEL in San Francisco against US; he

was advised to the contrary. He inguired as to the usual

number of cases assigned agent, and was advised that to

agent's best recollection probably 30 at any one time. He

asked if agent's work was exclusively security during the

handling of the COINTEL Program and he was advised agent

did have some criminal assignments. He inquired if there

was

any relationship between COINTEL and criminal assignments,

and he was advised no and that agent desired to limit the

scope of his questioning to the COINTEL Program.

SEIDEL then asked how many suggestions the agent

had submitted in COINTEL.

He was advised that an estimate

would be difficult but probably the nearest figure would be

some two suggestions a month with possibly six months in

two years when no suggestions, were made.

He inquired as

to agent's knowledge of what percentage of total proposals

from all sources submitted to the Bureau had been approved,

and he was advised only a small percentage.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

At this point, SEIDEL requested agent. to outline the

types of COINTEL proposals submitted by San Francisco.

He

was answered that anonymous letters, letters with pseudonyms,

and letters signed with the name of an existing person had

been used.

It was pointed out that the program had included

the use of anonymous letters, including those directed to

landlords advising that the Black. Panther Party was occupying

their property; letters to people supporting BEP programs,

including the Breakfast Program and enclosing copies of the

BPP color book for children encouraging the shooting of

police officers and/or articles from the "Black Panther

Party", the official BPP newspaper, showing their propensity

advocacy of violence; letters to organizations containing

articles that showed the BPP in direct opposition to their

aims, such as a letter to a Jewish organization showing BPP

support

of Palestine guerrillas.

It wa's pointed out that letters had been directed

to ELDRIDGE CLEAVER in Algeria in the names of BPP members.

At this point, SEIDEL interrupted to explain that he was

enlisting the

complete cooperation of the interviewee, that

there had been some Congressional criticism of the COINTEL,

that there were some segments of the population that were

anti-FBI and that he desired to present the FBI in a proper

light, and that he had good friends in the Bureau.

SEIDEL asked, was it necessary to have utilized

COINTEL.

Agent advised that it was difficult to correctly.

judge the effect of the program but it was felt it was not

without some effect because the Black Panther Party had not

only dwindled from a membership of approximately 1,000 in

1969 to perhaps 200 in 1973, but that the organization became

split with dissension and had dropped much of its former

advocacy for violence.

SEIDEL then requested that the agent give his

recommendation on what COINTEL in the future should be;

whether there should be a division between security and

criminal investigations to different agencies in order that

a possible intrusion on the rights of an individual in

intelligence matters might not necessarily preclude his

being prosecuted by the Bureau, in a criminal matter. Agent

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

refused to furnish his "off-thecuff" opinion, pointing

out that he felt that it was without the scope of his

release.

Without further questioning agent concerning the

types of COINTEL proposals, SEIDEL next asked if the

Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) on the BPP was in operation

at the time COINTEL was initiated, and what proposals were

submitted in COINTEL based on information from ELSUR.

SEIDEL was advised agent's release would not allow

him to discuss ELSUR.

SEIDEL asked if the San Francisco Division had made

any "snitch"

proposals. When asked to clarify the question,

stated that this was a suggestion to the effect that a

Black Panther Party member be accused of being an FBI

informant. Agent replied that to the best of his recollection

no such recommendations had been made to the Bureau by San

Francisco, and on the contrary, agent knew that it had been

pointed out by San Francisco that any such allegation should

be most carefully considered inasmuch as BPP history has

indicated that they had dealt severely with suspected infor-

mants, even to the point of killing them.

SEIDEL then asked if the San Francisco Division

had received a great deal of "flak" from the Bureau

on this

program.

He was advised that the Bureau operates a

"tickler

system"

for following investigations and that the program

had received some priority from the FBI but agent had never

considered correspondence from the Bureau as being "flak"

SEIDEL at this point instead of questioning made

the statement that the Bureau gave this matter "high priority".

No comment was made to this statement.

SEIDEL next questioned agent if he had read any

publicity concerning a May ll, 1970 letter from the Bureau

- to San Francisco entitled, "Special Operations Research", in

which it was suggested that some consideration be given to

furnishing the BPP spurious documents that supposedly

originated with the Oakland Police Department and the FBI.

He explained that some newspaper had received a copy of the

document under the Exeedom of Information Act and thereafter

published it. He inquired if a response to the letter

had been made by San Francisco. Agent advised that it was

his recollection that San Francisco had responded recommending

against both proposals, pointing out that the Bip had in the

short past published contingency plans of the Berkeley Police

Department for a raid on National Headquarters to the

embarrassment of that agency.

San Francisco was of the

opinion that if spurious documents were furnished to the

BPP they would immediately publish them, rather than attempt

SIDEL, asked for agent's knowledge of why the letter

had been captioned as previously described rather than

Counterintelligence Program, Black Panther Party. Agent

stated he had no recollection of exact caption of the letter.

SEIDEL then went on to explain that he had been advised

that

the Bureau had several COINTELS and the one covering Special

Operations Research

was a COINTEL covering foreign operations.

Agent made no comment.

SEIDEL requested what proposals had been made to

disrupt the BPP newspaper; how did the proposals originate,

and what offices submitted them.

He was advised that it was

agent's

recollection

that the Bureau may have requested

suggestions from several offices but that to agent's knowledge

When SEIDEL continued to question the

agent concerning specific proposals and why their approval

was not recommended by San Francisco, he was advised that one

proposal was the use of a foul-smelling chemical to put on

San Francisco was of the opinion it would not .

be practical inasmuch as it would contaminate an airplane

and

would subject the airline or the printing company to

damages. SEIDEL was further advised that it was believed

the suggestion may have been made for the changing of a first

page of an issue at the printing company to embarrass the BPP,

but it was pointed out that this would also merely result in

• a claim being filed against the printer.

SEIDEL was advised that there may have been a

suggestion that some thought should be given to the possible

delay of the plates for the paper, that suggestion coming .

at the time when the paper was being printed in New York

with the master copy being filmed in San Francisco. San

Francisco did not suggest approval because a mere delay would

have been of little benefit because the paper was not timely.

U.S.' SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTERVIEW OF SA LEO S. BRENNEISEN

SEIDEL asked about the disruption of the BPP

Breakfast Program. The answer was given that agent had

no recollection of this, and SEIDEL was asked did he have

any information from the Bureau that we had attempted a

disruption of the program in San Francisco.

He related

that he believed not and that it probably happened in

San Diego.

SEIDEL asked about a suggestion that informants

set up a possible confrontation between the BPP and the

Republic of New Africa (RNA). Agent stated he had no

recollection of such a proposal

and did not believe it had

been submitted by San Francisco because the membership and

activity in RNA had been minimal in this area.

SEIDEL, then asked if we had suggested that landlords

in the San Francisco area be encouraged to insist on their

rent from the BPP. Agent advised he had no recollection

of this, but could see nothing wrong in it.

SEIDEL inquired as to the amount of knowledge.

that SAC CHARLES BATES would have had concerning COINTEL.

He was advised that agent had no information, that he, himself,

had never discussed the program with MI. BATES while it was

in operation.

SEIDEL then inquired if Former SAC HARRY

MORGAN had been ill during the time he was assigned to San

Francisco and the reason for his transfer.

Agent replied

he had no information concerning this matter.

SEIDEL WaS

asked if he felt that anyof the actions

agent described as being taken by the San Francisco Division

were illegal. SEIDEL stated that he did not believe that

these were matters that were in violation of any existing

criminal statutes, but there might be some question as to

whether the FBI had the specific authority to do these things.

SEIDEL ended the interview by again reiterating

that he was a friend of the Bureau, that he was making an

• inquiry and

desired to obtain the opinions of both Headquarters

and agents in the field, and that he may make a request to the

Bureau to widen the scope of agent's release.

Agent was not placed under oath and when agent

to discuss ELSUR, SEIDEL suggested that he, SEIDEL, put

away his pencil and pad.

Agent replied that that was not

that all information furnished by him was at his own

No mention was made

He was interviewed in his home at 66 Elm,

Larkspur, California, by SSC Member Lester B. Seidel from

5:40

P.M. to. 6:55 P.M., August 12, 1975.

Clark was not placed under oath and no mention

However, Seidel was pleasant and

in no way antagonistic. The interview was general, not

penetrative, not in depth, and very few specific questions were

There appeared to be no discernible criticism of

either the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) or the

Bureau's investigation of the Black Panther Party (BPP) by

Seidel.

Seidel was compelled on more than one occasion

to declare that he was pro-FBI, that the object of his

inquiries was to assist the United States Senate in under-

standing the problem in order that they could consider

possible legislation that may eliminate any abuses in the

future.

Seidel did mention the fact several times that

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel finally asked Clark if he would have okayed

a COINTEL proposal like this and he answered that he would

have if he felt that it would have sufficiently hindered

the BPP, stating that possibly in some of these occasions

someone might get hurt but on the other hand, investigation

of the BPP by the FBI might be made easier and it might

also cut down on the number of BPP supporters.

Clark was asked to whom the main BPP case was

assigned and to whom COINTEL had been assigned in the San

Francisco Division.

Clark replied that he did not remember

but possibly during the time of his supervision, more than

one Agent had handled the matters.

Seidel asked how many BPP informants the San

Francisco Division had.

Clark replied he did not recall

ands:. he did not believe that Seidel had a right to know.

Seidel inquired about the BPP wire tap, asking

• who had requested the tap, the Bureau or the

San Francisco

Division.

Again, Clark replied that he did not recall but

the San Francisco Division would not have necessarily

waited for the Bureau to initiate the matter but might have

requested the Bureau rather than the Bureau having initiated

the matter.

Seidel wanted to have an example of a COINTEL

proposal.

He was not given a specific example but general

conversation was had to the effect that any move that might

be suggested that would aid the San Francisco Division in

their investigation of the seP in determining their

supporters and financiers and possibly disenchanting those

individuals might be an example.

Seidel did not ask Clark whether he had done a

particular thing.

Questioned concerning whether he felt COINTEL had

been effective, Clark replied he did not believe the matter

was

• susceptible to proof but the BPP had sure gone into a

steep decline.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel again brought up the Seberg matter and

asked if it had done any good. Clark stated he replied,

"Maybe."

During this conversation, Clark got the general

impression that perhaps Seidel did not feel that COINTEL

py hat sax

not that ta st made

had been necessary but Clark had argued that it had made

the BPP more difficult to operate and possibly easier

for the FBI to investigate.

Seidel then wanted to know what there was about

the BPP that caused such a concentration of FBI investi-

gative attention.

Clark pointed out that this would have

to be answered in the context of time, that at the time the

program

was initiated, there was no doubt that the BPP

was

a violent, racist organization opposing all law enforce-

ment, attacking officers and

generally disturbing the

tranquility of the cormunity.

Seidel then went on to discuss the business of

pressure.

Had

• Special Agent in Charge Charles W. Bates

and the Bureau put too much pressure on the matter? Clark

stated there was undoubtedly pressure because everyone

was interested in doing the best type job possible and

finding out everything possible concerning the BPP.

There

was obvious pressure from the Bureau in the matter and the

Bureau, in a case like this, could never be satisfied.

Clark stated that he related that perhaps too much

pressure had come from the Bureau because he had felt at

the time he was a supervisor that San Francisco Division

knew more about the BPP than the Bureau.

On the other

hand, he related that Bureau officials were probably

under

pressure because of the national interest and the

demands on them in Washington.

Seidel related that he was interested in ascer-

taining what Agent would make the best witness to appear

in Washington to explain and testify concerning COINTEL.

He specifically requested Clark's recommendation and mentioned

the names of Special Agents Leo S. Brenneisen of San

Francisco and Bob Baker of Los Angeles.

Clark stated that

he had countered by suggesting that somebody in Washington

who directed the program and

approved all proposals might

be a better witness...

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA ALBERT P. CLARK BY

Clark recalled that near the first of the inter-

view, Seidel probably, more to make conversation than to

obtain information,

asked a few guestions concerning US

and the Republic of North Africa (RNA). He was advised

that US had not been active

in this division and there had

been no pertinent RNA activity brought to his attention.

Seidel asked if Ron Karenga of US had visited San Francisco

and. Clark replied he had no exact

recollection of this.

Seidel talked and asked Clark's opinion on the

separation into different agencies of the Bureau's criminal

and security investigations.

Clark stated that he told

Seidel that in the past he had considered this and

felt that

frankly it might have advantages, and at the same time,

might have disadvantages. He pointed out that the

disadvantages were that you could not be sure that it, in

fact, would work and that if you remove the security

investigations from the Bureau, you would undoubtedly

lose a great deal, including public support.

Seidel asked if Clark had worked under former

SAC Harry Morgan. He advised that he had retired prior to

the time Morgan was assigned to the San Francisco Division.

Clark pointed out that during the interview, a

recorder appeared prominently on his desk, and Seidel.

could, of course, not be sure that it was not in operation;

although as the duration of the interview lengthened, it

must have been obvious to seidel that it was not operating.

BY.SPHALM

BY

• On August 14, 1975, retired. former Special Agent.

William A. Cohendet was interviewed from 9:30 A.M: to

11:15 A.M. by Lester B. Seidel,

Investigator for the U.S.

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activites' (SSC).

The interview took place at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness

Avenue, San Francisco.

Mx. Seidel mentioned that he was serving as a

counsel for the SSC, investigating all phases of the United

States intelligence community, and he had chosen the Black

Panther Party and the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL)

as his field. He stated that he was hoping for full

cooperation on the part of the former Special Agent.

He was advised that former Special Agent Cohendet

was willing to cooperate with the committee and he trusted

that something constructive would come out of the effort

being put forward.

Former Special Agent Cohendet also

pointed out that in his opinion the Black Panther Party (BPP)

lad been a group devoted to violence, thievery, and traud

and the committee should realize the type of Subjects with

whom they are dealing in order to place the investigation

in its proper framework.

The first question concerned the former Special

Agent's background and Bureau service. This was briefly

furnished.

Seidel then asked when and how the technical

surveillances had been installed, who initiated them, and

• who approved them.

SSC STAFF MEMBER

The former Special Agent replied that he was

not party to any of these arrangements and did not know

any of the details.

Seidel then asked if former Special Agent

Cohendet knew the origin and purposes

• of the COINTEL

Program. He was informed that the former Agent did not

know the origin of the program, and said

he believed'its

purposes were those as set forth in the instructions which

Seidel had and which spoke for themselves.

The former

Agent admitted that said program at one time had been

= assigned to him but due to the press of other functions,

he had been unable to give it a great deal of time and

felt that during the period that it had been assigned to

him, it had been largely ineffective.

Seidel then asked if there was any connection

between ELSUR and COINTEL and the reply was

given

that

obviously there would be if the ELSUR material being

reviewed could be considered as having any pertinence to

a COINTEL operation.

However, former Special Agent Cohendet

could not recall having used

this material while the case

was assioned to him, at least to any significant degree.

Not having the files available made it impossible to

the material.

state positively if there had been any specific instance of use

Seidel asked as to the possible effectiveness of

anonymous letters and he was informed that in the opinion

of the former Agent,

such letters, particularly having to

do with personal infidelity or thievery, which were the

usual

suggested avenues, would have little effect on the

recipients who were active in such fields themselves much

of the time. In the more serious areas of perhaps trying

to falsely show that an individual was an FBI or police

informant,

the former Special Agent said that the use of

this technique would not be used for fear of causing bodily

harm or death to an innocent person due to the well-known

propensity of the BPP of dealing harshly with any suspected

deviator let alone informant.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked as to the value of ELSUR to

the BPP investigation and the former Special Agent stated

that in his bellet it was extremely valuable in many ways.

For instance, it assisted and gauged the true Huey Newton,

his plans, and weaknesses. It was also valuable in esti-

mating the possible effect of a certain COINTEL program

as possibly suggested by some other office.

As a result •

of their information,

the San Francisco Office usually

rejected most

suggestions as

being unlikely to be successful.

Seidel wondered if ELSUR was not the most

valuable,

single investigative aid that the Bureau had had

in this

investigation, and the former Special Agent agreed

that

he was probably

way probably cosect.

Seidel then wondered if the COINTEL proposals

should be part of some legislation proposed by Congress

and the former Special Agent replied that the Bureau

officials, in his opinion, should be allowed to comment

on this because the fact that the program would be ineffective

against the BPe might not be a valid argument that it would

not work to better advantage in other circumstances.

Former Special Agent Cohendet declined to

comment on the effectiveness of COINTEL as used against

the Socialist workers Party, not having had any experience

with its use in that field.

Seidel then asked about informants and asked if

there had been any pressure from the Bureau in the develop-

ment of such sources.

Former Special Agent Cohendet

acknowledged that there certainly had been great pressure

in this direction, as it was well known that informants were

a necessary part of any investigation and a police organi-

zation can never give up on this phase of its work no matter

how difficult the circumstances were in their development.

In the case of the BPP, the development of informants was

particularly difficult because of the fear that many persons

in the 'black community felt concerning the BPP as weil as

the lack of desire to cooperate against another black

person.

• Seidel asked about foreign funds being raised

and given to the BPP, and former Special Agent Cohendet

recalled that "Masai'

Hewitt and others went to Sweden

and other countries where the BPP raised money on speech

making tours.

Seidel then asked about any investigation of

BPP funds and former Special Agent Cohendet said that it

was his recollection that investigation of BPP funds had

been undertaken through legal channels but he had no

personal knowledge of the investigation and declined to

go further into this field.

Seidel asked about

referrals of Bureau information

to the Internal Revenue Service and former Special Agent

Cohendet said that he had no personal knowledge of what

had been done in this direction.

Seidel then asked about the affair between

Actress Jean Seberg and "Masai" Hewitt, which had appeared

Hollywood gossip column and had alleged that Seberg

had become pregnant by Hewitt. Seidel said that the Los

Angeles Office of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation had

admitted leaking this information to someone in the press.

Former Special Agent Cohendet knew that this

couple had been lovers for a brief period but denied any

knowledge of any leak to the press by either San Francisco

or Los Angeles.

Seidel asked if the former Agent thought that

leaking this type of information was appropriate.

NO

comment was offered as to this question.

Seidel, at the conclusion of the interview, said

that he had noted that the "faking" of police records as

suggested had never been undertaken and he observed that he

believed the COINTEL abuses were being

overplayed by the

press.

From what he learned in interviews in San Francisco,

it seemed to him that the program had been mostly played

down and indeed, an independent judgment had been exercised

in the implementation of the program.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA WILLIAM A. COHENDET BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

A general discussion of the BPP ensued in which

former Special Agent Cohendet reiterated the criminal

background and threatening attitude of many of the BPP

memoers, their mendacious ways, and their lack of credi

bility in their public statements. The former Special

Agent credited the news media with helping to build up

the BPP beyond its actual strength and influence.

Seidel asked about the former Agent's knowledge of the reason

for the removal of former SAC Harry Morgan from San

Francisco.

He said the only reason he was asking this

question was in order to avoid embarrassing former SAC

Morgan when he interviews him concerning his possible

knowledge of BPP activities sometime in the future. Former

Special Agent Cohendet had no knowledge as to why

Mr. Morgan was transferred.

In summation,

Seidel ventured the opinion that he

thought the ELSUR technique was far moré valuable in the

carrying out of the investigation of the BPP than the

COINTEL. Former Special Agent Cohendet had to agree

to the above observation.

Former Special Agent Cohendet was not advised

of any rights that he might have in declining to answer

any questions and Seidel said he was actually seeking

witnesses for a possible hearing in Washington, D.C. He

stated that no

names would be mentioned in

he would make concerning his interviews.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

San Francisco, California

August 13, 1975

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREINIS

On August 12, 1975, retired former SA David E. Todd

was interviewed from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. by Lester B. Seidel,

Investigator for the SSC.

The interview

took place at the

Holiday Inn, San Francisco.

By way of background, in all contacts with Seidel

previously, former SA Toda has

indicated to him great reluctance

to discuss these matters without clearance from the Bureau,

and pointed out to Seidel that the Bureau had released former

SA Todd from the Employment Secrecy Agreement for the purpose

of a staff interview, but Seidel was told

that former SA Todd

did not think it was either his responsibility or his prerogative

to provide information or make information public; that while

employed he was acting as an Agent of the Federal Government

and felt it was the responsibility of the Federal Government to

provide the information,

and that if the Senate Committee

desired information from

I former SA Todd, the questions should

have been submitted to him in writing, and his answers should

have been made in writing and first forwarded to the FBI, and

then after the FBI determined it advisable to make these answers

available to the Committee, that would have been the proper

channel.

Seidel pointed out the Committee and the Bureau had

made an agreement whereby the Bureau would make Agents available

to the Committee for interview. Former SA Todd pointed out to

Seidel that he is not in the category of an Agent, being a

retired Agent,

and at this point there was no additional discussion

on this matter.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of

the FBI.

It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your

agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed outside

your agency.

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel was also told that nothing that was said by

former SA Todd should be interpreted as being critical of

the Counterintelligence Program (COINTEL) itself, and that if

the Bureau felt that such a Program was necessary in the interest

of national defense, he had carried it out in the best way he

saw fit, and that in recommending against specific proposals

as being impractical of inadvisable, these recommendations were

against the specific incidents recommended and not against the

Program as a whole.

Seidel's first questions dealt with former SA Todd's

background and the extent of his Bureau service, and whether

he had worked security or criminal matters.

Former SA Todd

gave him chronologically the offices in which he had served

in the

Bureau, and stated he had been associated

• from 1952 to

1956 with the

Domestic Intelligence Division, Washington, D.C.,

and had become Supervisor in San Francisco in December, 1969,

of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and that during his Bureau

career he had worked both criminal and security matters.

Seidel asked the name of the squad which was originally

the

Racial Squad, and subsequently changed to Extremist Matters,

and

he asked whether the work was strictly intelligence, or

whether it combined intelligence or criminal work.

It was

pointed out Bombing Matters were originally being handled on

this Squad for a period of time,

and that both the criminal

activities of the Panthers, as well as intelligence activities,

were combined in the assignment.

Seidel then asked when the technical surveillances on

the Panthers were installed. Former SA Todd replied that they

were functioning at the time he was appointed Supervisor. Seidel

then asked how was the technical surveillance related to the

COINTEL, if at all, and specifically whether information coming

Former SA Todd advised that he could not recall

specifically what was done in either Program without reviewing

the files and comparing the information therein with the source.

Seidel seemed very interested in this, but actually the question

could not be answered on the basis of recollection alone, and

was

not.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER

SA DAVID E. TODD BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

Seidel then asked how would the Panther COINTEL

be defined with regard to aims, techniques and results.

answer to this was that the aims were to counter generally the

revolutionary objectives and activities of the Panthers.

question concerning techniques was left unanswered, and as

far as results go, former SA Todd told Seidel that he did not

feel there had been any great results from the Program as it was

pursued in the San Francisco Office, but he could not speak

for the rest of the Program as far as the Bureau is concerned.

Seidel asked whether the Agents working the criminal

aspects of the BPP received information that was received from

a technical source, and he was told procedures by which

information had been routed to them in their cases, and that at

the time we operated these technical surveillances, we felt they

had been installed lawfully, and that the information received

could be used.

Seidel asked whether there was a great deal of pressure

put on the San Francisco Office for the development of informants.

He was told yes, that informants were the backbone of good law

enforcement and

the Bureau constantly urged better informant

coverage.

Seidel asked if there had been similar pressure placed

on the office in the COINTEL, and former SA Todd replied that

he did not feel that any great pressure had been put on the

office to carry out this Program, but that the Bureau had recom-

mended the Program, however, had left it up to the office

pretty much as to how it should be carried out.

Seidel asked whether the Program had been successful

in causing dissention within the Party. Former SA Todd told

him that he did not feel this had been particularly effective

in any way, and that causing dissention had not been a primary

objective of the Program in the San Francisco Office, and that

the policy had been to use the Program for primarily

two

purposes: 1) for the purpose of developing informants by.

attempting to dissuade them from their loyalties to the Party;

and 2) to make representations to Panthers for whom outstanding

arrest warrants had been issued in order to flush them out so

they could be apprehended.

-

Seidel asked specifically about the COINTEL involving

the Breakfast Program, and was told a recommendation had been

made for putting some

kind of contamination in the Breakfast

Program food, and that this office had felt this extremely

inadvisable and recommended against it, and it was not carried

out here.

Former SA Todd was also asked about a COINTEL

proposal relating to "The Black Panther" newspapers, and was

told that such a proposal had been made involving saturating

the papers with a foul smelling fish oil

or some substance,

however, we recommended against this as it would serve no purpose.

Seidel was advised that the San Francisco policy had

been to recommend against harassment, per se,

and also recommended

against leaking information to the press. Seidel then raised

the question about the incident where Huey P. Newton's high

standard of living was given to the press, and he was told

that this fell into the category of informant development on

the basis it was felt that if those Panthers who were living

practically in poverty could realize what Newton's standards

of living were, it might change their allegience to him and

they could be contacted for informant purposes.

Seidel was also told that in this phase of the

COINTEL, it was former SA Todd's recollection that this infor-

mation regarding Newton's high standard of living had been

disseminated by informants, and that the press was well aware

of Newton's standards of living without having to make this

information available to them.

Seidel asked what the instructions had been from the

Bureau in carring out the COINTEL.

Former SA Todd told Seidel

that he had reviewed this file after being appointed Supervisor,

but could not recall specifically what the Bureau instructions

were.

The only other instructions received were at a two day

conference in Washington, D.C., on BPP matters conducted by

former Assistant to the Director William Sullivan, and Section

Chief George Moore, at which time it was pointed out that the

Bureau desired the COINTEL to be coordinated with the Bureau,

but that former SA Todd did not recall any firm prohibition against

SSC STAFF MEMBER

taking certain actions without Bureau authority, and that the

field had some leeway in what they did, but, in general, offices

made proposals to the Bureau with copies to San Francisco

prior to taking any action. Seidel asked why San Francisco

got copies of all proposals, and was told this was because

San Francisco was office of origin in the BPP case and other

offices were required to furnish a copy of all correspondence.

Seidel then asked to what extent Special Agent in

Charge Charles W. Bates had knowledge of the COINTEL as it

related to the BPP, and he was told that former SA Todd could

not speak for Bates and his knowledge would be dependent upon

how carefully he read incoming mail and reviewed files, and

former SA Todd had no knowledge as to what extent Bates did this.

Seidel was told that under the supervisory setup in the

office at the time, former SA Todd felt it was his responsibility

to direct this Program in San Francisco and not Bates.

Seidel indicated that out of his investigation in the

hearings, undoubtedly there would be some legislation coming

out of Congress that would either enable or prohibit such

things as the COINTEL, and he stated that was one reason he

was asking concerning its effectiveness, and wondered what former

SA Toda would recommend.

Seidel was told that former SA Todd

felt it essential that the Government should have the right to

defend itself against individuals and groups who advocate

violent revolution or who are aligned with foreign powers,

and that there was a need for some sort of legislation within

the framework of constitutional government which would enable

the government to do this; but, of course, it should be done

under. proper control. Seidel asked for suggestions as to what

sort of control, and was told that this was a matter for

Congress to decide, but perhaps Congress should look into some

legislation similar to wiretap legislation, where the responsi-

bility is upon a Federal judge to issue

warrant.

Former SA Todd had prepared a brief summary of what

he recalled of the activities of the BPP, and he made a copy of

this available to Seidel. Former SA Todd also had made a

chronology to assist him in answering questions, together with

some notes concerning COINTEL policy, former SA Todd's general

recollection of matters, questions of law regarding agent -

principle, privileged information problems, ongoing litigatior

and national defense, and informants and sources.

Seidel asked

for a copy of this chronology and this, too, was given to him.

Seidel expressed great interest in receiving the one

page summary of the Panthers' activities, and stated that he

had chosen the Panthers for a case study, and he seemed more

interested in this than in the COINTEL.

He also indicated that

there might be future interviews and that former SA Todd might

be called

as

a witness

before the Committee at a later date.

At the outset of the interview, Seidel asked whether

former SA Todd desired his rights be read to him. Former

SA Todd told him that since he did not interpret this as a

custodial interview, and it was his understanding Seidel had no

police power, that

he could forego reading the rights.

Former SA Todd did not feel it was necessary to

consult with a Bureau representative at this time.

The above information was furnished by former SA Toda

voluntarily and was not solicited.

At the time I began serving as supervisor in late 1969,

the Black Panther Party was under co-leadership of Huey Newton,

national welfare * **."?

B.

How was the armed attack on the

President (Truman?) connected with the

Coyne letter?

A. With reference to page 1 of the

report to the NSC dated Mar. 5, 1954:

(1) Does an overall reading of this

page reasonably convey the impres-

sion that program objectives were

designed to protect against sub-

veision by domestic groups that

might be directed, or controlled

by a foreign power?

(2) If yes, and since

"the IIC members

recognize their responsibility as

assigned by the Directives * **"

does this mean that the Directives

apply to only such domestic groups

and the members recognized this

limitation? If not, please explain.

If A(l) is no, please explain

giving specific consideration to

the necessity for the first 3

paragraphs on the page and the

need to integrate domestic and

foreign intelligence. (See goal 1.)

A. Do Mr. Hoover's Nov. 6, 1958 comments

concerning the usurpation of jurisdic-

tion from local authorities indicate

his belief

that the FBI was not

B. Was it ever the FBI's position that it

was not and/or did not desire to be a

national police?

C. Is crime prevention through the gathering

of intelligence a police function?

D. If not, please explain.

E. If yes, how do the FBI's domestic intelli-

gence gathering activities differ from

the usual police function?

F. If there is no substantive difference,

does this mean the FBI, in the area of

domestic intelligence gathering, now con-

stitutes and performs as a national

police force?

G. If not, please explain.

A. Is the Emergency Detention Law (EML) the

same as Subchapter II of the Internal

Security Act of 1950? (ISA)?

B. Mx. Hoover's testimony (Emergency Supple-

mental Appropriations Bill, 1940, at

304) indicates that the FBI maintained a

list or index of subversive individuals

prior to the enactment of the ISA:

(1) What did the FBI call this list or

index?

(2) Did the list contain the names or

individuals whether or not potentiall

dangerous?

C. Did the EML/ISA specifically require the

FBI to maintain a list of potentially

dangerous subversives?

(1) If so, how did the EML/ISA list

differ from the subversive list

already being maintained by the FBI?

(2) If there were differences between

the

two lists, what criteria was

used to determine whether to list

an individual on the EML/ISA index?

(3) If there were no significant

differences between the lists, why

was the EML/ISA list necessary aside

from any statutory requirement?

F.

Did the ISA ever provide for the emer-

gency detention of individuals who might

possibly commit, or conspire to commit,

acts other than espionage or sabotage?

(1) If so, please identify such other

acts.

(2) If not, did the EML/ISA list ever

contain the names of individuals

who might engage in subversive

activities other than expionage or

sabotage?•

(3)

If so, what authority permitted

their

inclusion on the EML/ISA list?

A. Is the Domestic Intelligence Division

mentioned in Mr. Hoover's memorandum of

May 11, 1961, an FBI or DOJ division?

A. Besides the memorandum of Attorney

General Clark, dated Sept. 14, 1967, con-

cerning urban riot activity:

(1) How many other specific case-by-case

instructions regarding domestic

intelligence investigative matters

have been received from

the Attorney

General or DOJ?

(2)

(3)

When were such instructions received?

What were the subject matter of the

instructions?

(4) Please provide copies of such

instructions.

A. "* * * the FBI gradually came to be

side the foreign controlled espionage and

sabotage matters ***":

(1) Does this sentence mean that initiall

the FBI had authority to only conduct

intelligence operations of those

domestic organizations or individuals

that were controlled by or connected

with a foreign power and could

• possible be used for espionage or

sabotage?

Exactly when did the FBI begin to use

its statutory authority to conduct

criminal investigations as a basis for

its domestic intelligence operations?

A.

Does the FBI view Attorney General

Clark's Sept. 14, 1967 memorandum as

activities constituted

"subversive activities * * * or any

activities that are possibly detrimental

to the internal

security of the United

States"?

D.

If so, please provide copy of such

testimony.

E. If not, how could Congress at that time

know or appreciate what the FBI was

actually doing in the area of domestic

intelligence investigations.

A. During Mr. Hoover's testimony on Jan. 5,

1940, on the Justice Department Appro-

priations Bill, 1940, at 153, did Mr.

Question

E. MI. Hoover also mentions at 181, that

the general intelligence index included

the names of such persons as "known espio-

nage agents, known sabotears, leading

members of the Communist party; and the

bund."

(1) Can it be reasonably concluded that

this listing reflects what. the FBI,

at that time, considered its intelli-

gence investigation authority under

the Presidential Directives to be,

i.e., limited solely to espionage

and sabotage matters, and domestic

groups connected with foreign

governments?

(2)

(3)

If not, please explain.

If other types of groups or individ-

uals were included in the index,

please describe their activities.

(4)

not mentioned in the testimony,

could Congress be fully

apprised of

of the scope of the FBI's intelli-

gence investigation activities at

that time?

(5) If so, please explain.

A.

Does the FBI believe that Congress has,

by receiving testimony about the FBI's

domestic intelligence activities as well

as intelligence information, recognized

the scope of FBI domestic intelligence

activities and tacitly approved of those

activities?

B. If not, please explain.

C. If so,

does the FBI consider this tacit

approval to be an additional authority

to conduct domestic intelligence

activities?

tions had been received from the Attorney

General or DOJ?

(3)

If so, please list the areas where this

was done and provide pertinent docu-

mentation.

authority was conveyed to the

FBI by the Presidential Direc-
