5, Station Support,

a. On the morning of 1 December 1963, PARMUTH assisted RESCIGNO
in installing audio microphones under the flooring of an LCHARVEST occupied
apartment. .{8ae HMMA-22608, Il Dec 63, para 5.d,) Lines leading from the
audio instaliation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which had
ample semi-crawling space between the target area and the LP apartment,
RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered this crawling space by removing a small

section of flooring located inside the LP apartment. There is also a trap door
leading inté the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although
the curious would be discouraged to enter this area because of stagnant water
six to ten inches deep on the floors at all times, cob webs, bugs, etc., ete...
Three audio microphones were installed on this operation,

b, During the period 2-14 December 1963, PARMUTH again handled
LLFIRES 4/5 while Marvin A, CABOT was on annual leave.

¢, On 6 December 1963 PARMUTH forwarded to KURIOT/WAVE
Headquarters two orders of envelopes (six month supply per cach request)
and one request for stamps, The envelopes were handcarried by Timothy A.
CAPRIOTT to WAVE Headquarters, avoiding a week's delay if the exvelopes
were sent through the pouch from Mexico City, The stamps were handcarried
by another [DYer to the States for mailing to Washington.

d, On 6 December 1963 PARMUTH was requested to re-enter the

LP covering the LCHARVEST apartment as reported in para 5.a, of this report.
The purpose of thie visit was to unlock a closed door which stured the LP equip-
ment which monitors LCHARVEST activities in that apartment, Although the
basehouse keeper had a key which worked well for several days previously, the
lock would not open for the agent on the'afternoon of 6 December. PARMUTH
entered the apartment at 0130 hours on 7 December and unlocked the door, It
was found that the throw bolt located inside the lock was broken, For security
purposes, two other locks were removed from other doors located in the same

room to check if these locks were in the same bad condition, In each case,
when the key was inserted into the lock and turned excessively, the throw bolt

snapped. A new lock of the same type manufacture was installed on the closet
door by the basehouse keeper on 7 December 1963.

e. On the night of 7 December 1963, PARMUTH was requested by
the COS to install an.extension phone at the COS residence, Alter a short
training period given by RESCIGNO at the @(RCHARITY base, PARMUTH was
able to service this request satisfactorily. This extension was one which :

replaced one removed (for study) by KUSODA officials who inspected Mexico,

{, On 10 December 1963 PARMUTH photographed 423 frames, using
the Recordak to fulfill a monthly Staff D requirement for the Chief of Station.

and PARMUTH met at the LIERODE basehouee to install the 35mm SEQUENCE

camera. The complete system was then dismantled by SWINEHART #0 that Lv2
could re-install the system from the beginning. This was done by L-22 and met
with SWINEHART's watisfaction, Although the Consulate door was closed to the
public for a period of six days for unknown reasons ae of the night of 17 December
1965, testa were made using the SEQUENCE camera photographing people walking
by the Consulate door. The camera worked well and produced good printable
negatives, On the morning of 18 December 1963, L22 contacted PARMUTH and
explained that the Consulate door was now open to the public and receiving
visitors as of 1010-that day. PARMUTH and SWINEHART joined L-2 shortly
later at the LIERODE basehouse and found that the camera system was working
well and photographing people entering and leaving this target drea, SWINEHART
then processed this film at the Station lab and made sample prints of the day's
take to be prosented to the COS and C/PBRUMEN for their approval, Both were
‘very pleased with the photographic results using thie type of camera equipment,
at the-LIERODE basehouse, As of this reporting, the SEQUENCE camera is
using approximately 100 feet of Plus X film between 0900 and 1400 hours (office
hours-for the Consiilate). 1-23 uses the present dark room area to photograph
traffic entering and leaving the front gate of the Embassy and is on duty from
9800 to 1800 hour's daily, six days a week. In order for L-22 to process the film
from both of these cameras and make prints daily, it will be necessary to install
another darkroom at the basehouse, 1-22 will need a Morse Tank for processing
film, a drying rack, and a small PAKO dryer for finishing prints in order to
satiety PBRUMEN requirements at the Station, Forwarded as enclosure 2 is
