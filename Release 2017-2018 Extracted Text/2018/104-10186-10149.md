never went on very long.

Apparently during 1962, there had been considerable sentiment

for Anibal ESCALANTE and his faction, the Partido Socialista

Popular (PSP),

but an 1964 the PSP group was disrupted and

the roal loyalty was to Fidol CASTRO rather than to the Party.

ESCALANTE, while he remained in Cuba, was apparently the

linison officer between the DGl and the PSP.

When ESCALANTE

left Cuba,

the llaison between the DGI and the PSP was

taken over by Ramiro VALDES,

and he was

described as a true representative.

The DGI operated

strictly on orders from the Party, conveyed through VALDES.

Membership In the Partido Unido Revolucionaria Socialista

(PURS) made life caster and eniry into the GI more simple.

Setween August 1963 and April 1964, all new personnel hirec

y the DGI came from the Union de Jovenes Comunistas (Unlor

of Young Communists - UJC), which was PURS-oriented.
