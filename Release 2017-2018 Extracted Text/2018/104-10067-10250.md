"1.

In a document entitled 'Historic Diary' there appears an entry

which refers to

'an

elderly American'

The entry is under the date 26

October 1959 when OSWALD was allegedly confined in an unidentified Moscow

hospital.

It is apparent that every effort should be made to iden-

tify the

elderly American, if he existed.

We assume the lead is

still outstanding.

It is

our recommendation that the Department of State

urgently request through its channels a careful search of Embassy and Con-

sular records

in Moscow which might reveal the identity of an elderly

American hospitalized at the end of October 1959 and possibly registered

with the Embassy

as a tourist.

An independent confirmation of this de-

tail could be of freat significance in validating the entries of OSWALD's

'Historic Diary' and would possibly lead to the development of additional

information on OSWALD's stay in the USSR.!'

Memorandum for J.

Lee RANKIN,

General Counsel

Subject: Documents on Lee Harvey OSWALD Furnished by the Sovlet Govern-

| [DDP 4-1764]

"1.

The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of.

May 1964 provide some additional detail on OSWALD.

The information in

these documents parallels that already available from other sources, and

does not contradict our previous information." The documents do clarify

somewhat OSWALD's alleged occupation at the Minsk radio plant giving the

original Russian terms used in decsribing his job.

"2.. The following points relating to' the documents are worth noting:

"a. A significant omission from the materials provided is the letter

OSWALD allegedly wrote to the Supreme Soviet requesting

Soviet citi-

zenship.

"b. OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

stateless Persons,

and a second receipt in 1962 for his Identity

Jocument for Foreigners.

The similarity of wording of the receipts

regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and travel regula-

tions further supports our belief that such regulations are identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD should have obtained permission in July 1961

to travel to Moscow, but, as we know from other cases, failure to ob-

tain travel permission is not uncommon and not a serious offense.

"c. The includsion of Marina's exit visa 'application' is singular

view of the fact that the Commission had not requested information

The Soviet translators for OSWALD's early documents are believed

to be identical with persons already referred to in OSWALD's 'diary'.

...

The format and wording of subject documents appear to be consistent

with Soviet practice."

Statements Reportedly Made by George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT

Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the Assassination of President Kennedy.

[DDP 4-3479]

The information

furnished below has been received from usually reli-

able sources and consists of statements reportedly made by the de MOHREN-

SCHILDTs concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and

the assassination of President

Kennedy.

"a.

Shortly after the assassination of President

Kennedy, George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT werE

among the guests attending a cocktail party in Haiti.

The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were

asked if there was

any

substance to the view expressed in certain foreign

periodicals such as L'Express, a left-wing Parisian

veekly newspaper, that the Kennedy assassination was

a plot organized by Dallas millionaires.

George de

MOHRENSCIILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very

likely that certain reactionary elements in Dallas had

organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis-

turbed person such as OSWALD to achieve their ends.

Mrs: de MOHRFNSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis.
