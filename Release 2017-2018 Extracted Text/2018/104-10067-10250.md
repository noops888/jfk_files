"On the question of why Lee OSWALD felt that he could ‘not L get his Mexican

visa extended without using his real name, the following may be germane:

Mexican immigration records checked by the U.S. Consulate in Nuevo Laredo

and reported through the U.S. Embassy to both out office and yours, showed

that Lee OSWALD entered Mexico on 26 September 1963 using thé name HARVEY

OSWALD LEE. It may be that OSWALD feared that. any attempt to extend his

visa would result in discovery that he was in the country under a false

"1. The information furnished below has been received from usually reli-

Kennedy. concerning Leé Harvey OSWALD and the assassination oF. President
Kennedy.

"a. Shortly after the assassination of President
Kennedy, beoree and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT were

among the ‘guests attending a cocktail party in Haiti. -
+ + + The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was |
any substance to the view expressed in certain foreign
periodicals such as i Express. a left-wing Parisian
weekly newspaper, that the Kennedy assassination was.

a plot organized by Dallas millionaires. George de
MOHRENSCIILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very
likely that certain reactionary elements in Dallas had
‘organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis-
turbed person such as OSWALD to achieve their ends. ;
Mrs, de MOHRENSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis...

"1, A review of the results of monitoring, Soviet foreign broadcasts at
the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had apparently been
taped was conducted with negative results. Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facili-
ty for internal consumption. :

"2. With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any
attempt had heen made by the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for. propaganda
purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts, or lectures.
NOSENKO replied that. this had not been done either in Moscow or in Minsk.
