As pointed out on previous

occasions

the political faction has permitted gambling

and illegal selling of liquor to continue in the Hot

types of persons visit hot Springs. Therefore,

it is natural that a

number of these individuals will be

The Little Rock Office is continuing

its program relative

to this matter.

OWEN VINCENT MADDEN is becoming more lenient in

furnishing information concerning criminal activities and he

is being considered as a criminal informant by the Little Rock

office.

DANE HARRIS who is in control of gambling activities

and other gamblers in Hot Springs will furnish information

conceming criminal activities.

In the Little Rock area the most prominent gamblers,

Others are currently being utilized as CI's or PCI's for the

Little Rock Division.

The criminal activities in the Fort Smith area

and the Lake Village area are being closely followed through

informants for investigation.

Since there is no specific evidence of extensive

vice or corruption in the Little Rock Division, no additional

separate cases are being opened at this time other than cases

'elative to subscribers to race wire service. In the even

evidence is received indicating extensive vice and corruptio

the Bureau will be promptly advised and appropriate new cases

will be opened.
