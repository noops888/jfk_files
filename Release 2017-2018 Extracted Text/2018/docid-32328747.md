influence on organized crime. As pointed out on previous
occasions the political faction has permitted gambling

and illegal selling of liquor to continue in the Hot

Springs area for many years. In view of the good climate,
thermal baths, horse racing, gambling activities, and night
club shows all types of persons visit Hot Springs. Therefore,
it is natural that a number of these individuals will be

of the criminal type. The Little Rock Office is continuing
its program relative to this matter.

OWEN VINCENT MADDEN is becoming more lenient in
furnishing information concerning criminal activities and he
is being considered as a criminal informant by the Little Rock
Office. DANE HARRIS who is in control of gambling activities
and other gamblers in Hot Springs will furnish information
conceming criminal activities.

In the Little Rock area the most prominent gamblers,
K. BARNEY LEVINE, CECIL HILL, HAROLD DUNAWAY, JUNE LYTLE and
others are currently being utilized as CI's or PCI's for the
Little Rock Division.

The criminal activities in the Fort Smith area
and the Lake Village area are peing closely followed through
informants for investigation.

Since there is no speéific evidence of extensive
vice or corruption in the Little Rock Division, no additional
separate cases are being opened at this time other than cases
relative to subscribers to race wire service. In the event
evidence is received indicating extensive vice and corruption
the Bureau will be promptly advised and appropriate new cases
will be opened.
