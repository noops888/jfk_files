MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

suBsECT:, Cocktail Party with Official.
: Bloc Representatives _

1. Ata arty giyen b; the local head of the Consular
Corps Association on’ 28une/'the undersigned met and again | |
chatted with’ Vale) of the Soviet Embassy.. He ~~
also met for the first time-Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy
who was introduced to undersigned by LOGINOV.

2. As usual LOGINOY spent most of the time conversing
with undersigned provocating him ona number of issues, The
undersigned answered, making a few similar comments about the
_ Chinese Civil War, When LOGINOY mentioned Vietnam, undersigned.

felt it would be nice if the-Soviets helped the U. S. to

bring peace to-that area so they could concentfate more-on

the Chinese Communist danger.. At one point in the conversation
undersigned jokingly -asked LOGINOV if. there: weré Soviét
_. Mationals in North Vietnam, The latter said, we have:
“many advisors there," The undéersidnged said, "no, what he

meant was behind guns or.’in, the seats of airplanes."

“said absolutely nét. It also seems that LOGINOV has been

keeping track of the people he sees undersigned talking with

at cocktail parties, For example, LOGINOV was curious to

‘Know if undersigned has seen “his Haitian friendg." Undersigned

asked ep gpione - the black’ one or the white one. LOGINOV

whtte one, referring to the Haitian Vice Corsul whom

undersigned occasionally talks to. Undersigned said he had
seen the Haitian ‘at;the Haitian, National Day about a month
go but noted that, the only Soviet present at that party was-
ANDREYEV, ‘not LOGINOV.~ The latter, incidentally, corners
‘the Haitians anytime he. has “a :chance to, although he officially
’'.pod- poos” the Haitian regime, LOGINOV once more asked under~
“signed. when-he would come play tennis with him (this is about
the ‘fourth or fifth time). Undersigned told him he would do

so after he gets invited by LOGINOV as the latter has often
promised ‘to-do. One of the topicg that LOGINOV méttioned

was the Protection Section of the Embassy. . "Protection against
whom," he’ asked... The’ ‘undersigned gave him the usual lowdown:

on ‘the number of ‘tourists to Mexico and their problems,

LOGINOV must-have been interested in the-section as he mentioned
that a U. S, Vice-Consul working in that séction whom he had
met aeeea ey, will be transferring to another post.

- 3. JAKOWIEC appears to be a man’ who likes to talk, His
Spafiish is quasi bi-lingual and JAKOWIEC says, by the way,
that he learned it in Brazil. (His wife 1s a plump, very

‘Polish-iooking woman. | Her sa¥tial conversation was to laugh

at some of the, exchanges between LOGINOV and the undersigned;
ppear to. speak fluent Russian, —

the United . Poo a ponine: pe ‘d and commented that while the

Poles are close to Asiericahs in many things they are not so _

‘pleased at other things that the U. 8, does. Undersigned
deferred thf¢ disctission gf this point for another meeting.

“As many. of the Consular Corp; members know that undersigned

served many years in ‘Vietnam, the latter felt that he should
not. hide this.fact to the official bloc representatives as
they would find out about it anyway. This.came out for the --

; first time on the occasion ofthis cocktail party when

“ JAKOWIEC somehow-mentioned Vietnam and the efforts of. the

Polish members ofthe. Armistice Commission there, The
undersigned, who-has known a number of these people. quite well,
told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish as
they were -sons of Polish. emigrants to, France who returned to
Poland after Gomulka took power.” When JAKOWIEC started. to
imply that this indicated how wonderful things were in Poland,

-. undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees, .

many of whom worked under very difficult conditions in France
in. the coal mines, preferred thei hard work to the chance of

working. in Communist Poland,”

. ‘The next’ cocktail party ‘held ‘by the Consular :Assn.
will probably be held at-the Soviet Embassy. The President

of the Association told undersigned that LOGINOV had asked him
for his-agreement. to hoid ‘the next party at his Embassy, A
large attendance of official bloc representatives can therefore
Be expected at the next get-together.

‘ting. : : yo :
136 My wife and I entortained Subject and his wif at our
home on 27 Novenber, but ‘the evening was not meant to and did
not afford an opportunity: ‘to discuss the Soviets any furthers

Sub Joct dad tell me, howover, that he had ‘not gone to the-

29 November Soviet regeption afterall, because, despite by

- " ‘ourances that- “there was-no reason for him not to go, he
felt it. was: aimply safer to stay away fvon* hides Soviet Enbassy
altogether. At my-suggéstion, we agreed to get together for. : i

luich sometime inthe near future.

lh. For various reasons, including the poor state of —
Subjects health ‘when I called him one day’ in January, we did
“hot “get together for the. dunch until. 7 March,. This time, I
played it Straight, with Sub Jeet, told him that I was interested
in anything hie could tell me about GAZIYEV and- the otherSoviet
ha had.met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.
Subject was completely cooperative, and I ani ‘satisfied he aiiswered

"nly questions to'the best of his ability. “It. seemed to me, and”
stall does, that there vas only one possible reason why Subject’
"had not told me on 11 July what-he’ subsequently. told me on
1r Novenber- (eee, that he had been to GAATKEV's: home. twice and

on fete occasion had met another Soviet there) » This was that

: : am he fort somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting
the other Soviet there, and.as long as I didn't. push him too
hard (which I didn't-on'l1 July), he felt mre comfortable

t ignoring it, The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits

and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was
genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.

con ae



| about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find

Embassy over-attend'ng-the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to
impress me with-his sincerity about whose sidé he was on, and

felt obliged to completely clear the record by montioning the

7 visits to GAZIYEV's home..and imeet ing the other Soviet theres 8

15... Subject: stated that, GAZIYEV had. invited. him to his ©

; apartment’ for-dinner about a month before ‘he (Subject) wont ‘ta :

Chicago to get. married, This means that the dinner took place

only GAZIYEV and his wife’ in the apartment, but that’ a third.

“person was there when ‘Subject arrived. Subject said. GAZIYEV.
» | Uintroditeed the third person as Valentin "something." When e4

. asked af the last. name were LOGINOV, Subject immediately reacted

and said he was almost positive that was at. Subjects description
‘of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV. GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV wis
path the Enbassy (Subject couldn't. remember in what Capacity) and
desertbed LOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening
started off very casually, vith LocrNov expressing interest

in the Spanish | courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.

Locinov, who. Subject noted spoke almost as-good Spanish as most
of the Spanish teache rs. at the Institute, said he'd ‘Uke to get.
a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject. if

he could help him enroll,. choose the best course for him to.
dtart with, ete. Subject replied that he'd be happy to, although
it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in
Spanish. LOGINOY simply laughed this off, and it was agreed
Loctrov would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.
LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the
evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subjoct

Vand told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought

LOGINOV should, know that he was talking to someone who was

1+ "100% capitalist," completely pro-Anerican, and had absolutely a
‘no’ sympathy with Communism. © (While this sounds awfully blunt

‘in my. eyes, ‘the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to.
aye a bit blunt at times, and_ knowing” nis ideological leanings,

cr would not put it past htm to have said exactly this.) Subject

‘said that LOGE NOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the

| conversation’ heated Up again a stew minutes later when Subject ©

j commented that he had a pretty good idea of what “thé Soviets were
up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV agked what Subject meant, Subject
related the story he once told me about: having been in Veracrus
;a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
‘under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that feveryone knew
the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda.”

decided that LIREALM-1 should drop further efforts against
tho: Soviet, U.A,R.y and Indonesian targets. The decision
te discontinue efforts to develop contacts among Mexicans,
Yeo made at that timo, was later amended and LIREALN-1 wae
Shicusted with the handling of LIRELIC-1 along the lines of

1967 LIREALc1 had two main responsibilities: a). the “French

éniphasized’ that LIREALM=1 was in no way connected with the
Approach made ‘to the French access agent, The second item
on.which LIREALM-1 has made progress has beon the developrient
ofa Méxican cmployee-of-the French Embassy who ‘is used as a
general:courier inside'the Embassy. This. development, for -
security reasons, has been slo LIREALN-1's "line" has been
that-a person with "the ability". of the courier can-and
should expect a bettor paying. job than the one -he currently
holds. Thé courier onded up. taking that line as his own to
"protect" him .(as ho probably would have some trouble if the

{Embassy discovered ‘he was looking for another job). LIREALN-1

started -mecting the Mexican coutier outside the Fronch Embassy,
This: gave. LIREALM-1 the opportunity to talk to his prospect:

at some length without attracting “the attention--of -the. members
of the Embassy. This is as far as- the Station will allow
LIREALN-1 to go in this éase, whichis currently. boing reviewed.
to decide who will continue the development of the -Embassy
courier and how.’ LIREALN-1 will not, in any case, have any
connection with tho. person solected for this task. He will
continue to maintain contact with ‘the courier ‘but will start

“. to.see him less often and will admit, in the end, that finding

a job for him turned out to be more difficult than expected.

335-.LIREALM-1 néanwhiie is continuing to cultivate ae
number, of selected members of the French Embassy and reports
‘on their activities as a matter of routine. He has also
maintained contact for some months with a wealthy Mexican
businessman who is a good friend of DEVOSJOLY, ‘the ex-French
‘intelligence officer who provided the material for Leon URIS"
best seller Topaz. LIREALM-1, in fact, had established
DEVOSJOLY's identity: as coauthor of the book long before this
became known publicly.” He was Shown by DEVOSJOLY's friend -a
afe' at the latter's ‘house in México City full of documents.
probably bélonging to DEVOSJOLY. This information was reported
to. Headquarters via “special” channels,

Sy 4. LIREALN-1's handling of, LIRELIC-1 encompasses two

. targets. By far the more important one is LIOGLE. .The goal

here is hopefully to turn LIRELIC-1 into a penetration of
LIOGLE using. Several good contacts he has in this organization
as a Stepping stone, Some steps have been taken in this
direction.” LIRELIC-1 has addressed personal requests for
eassistance to current key LIOGLE personalities. “He has also
submitted his curriculum vitae in the hope of landing a job
in LIOGLE, . This has so far failed to produce any concrete
LIOGLE job offer. LIRELIC-1 realizes, of course, that he is
of no value to LNHARP unless -he obtains a. job giving him access
to hard information on LIOGLE plans and activities. The
promise of a regular salary, as a matter of fact, is completely
dependent on LIRELIC-l's ability to penetrate LIOGLE. In an
effort to maintain interim contact, however, and help LIRELIC-1
liquidate some personal debts, the Station, via LIREALM-1,
made him a loan of 3,000 pesos, Further details on the LIOGLE
“aspects of the LIRELIC-1 operation will be covered in the
forthcoming LIOGLE/LIRELIC progress report. In addition to

the above,, the Station made an effort to explore the possibility
of using a contact which| LIRELIC-1 had with a PRRU citizen
in Acapulco to. gain another.window into LIRI th PBRUMEN
“eitizen owns a small hotel in the Mexican resort occasionally
“Visited by LIRING personnel. Althouzh LIRELIC-1 himself once
delivered a package sent by his Acapulco friend and managed to
havo one or two.méctings with representatives of the LIRIN
Commercial Scetion (to-discuss the possibility of "trading"
with PBRUMEN), it was decided. in the end that LIRELIC~1's
access to LIRING was too superficial to be of any great benofit..
This decision was bolstered by the* departure. for PBRUMEN in
_ April 1968 of LIRELIC~1's PLRUMEN fricnd, who left for what
“appears to be an extended visit to try to Solve complicated
personal problons, Thus, with the "shelving" of possible :
dporational activitios against LIRING, LIOGLE became LIRELIC-1's
only target in Aprilof this year, 7

dealings with LIRELIC+1 have becn completely clandestine,

6. References D and E réviewed an incident which occurred
on 16 January and-had a,dircet bearing of LIREALN-1's security.
It 4s the opinion of this Station that thé person who saw
LIREALN-1 talk with Raynond’A, FRADYER and Wallace B, ROWTON
did not positively identify cithor of them, References stated
that ‘this person could.not' have ‘been Valentin Sergeyevich
LOGINOY, who claimed to have obsorvéd the meeting. Reference E
pointed out, that béfore joining the PBRUNEN Section in October
1967 ‘LIREALM-1 had for some timo interested hinself in the

~ getivities of thé ‘Sovicts at Station request, | He first ‘made’
Gontdet with LOGINOV, for example, in April 1967 and met with
him on the averago of once a week until October 1967.

_ Referetice E also pointed out that LIREALM-1 only had four
meetings witl the Soviet from October 1967 to January 1968. .,

The Station wants to omphasize once more that’ these were all

at LOGINOV's initiative, LIREALN-1 had discontinued his efforts

to maintain contact with the Soviet at Station's directive.

As pointed out above, one of the main targets now handled by

.LIREALM-1 is the French, One of the best places to meet
Frenchmen is the French Club. Station would be very reluctant ,
to have LIREALN-1, a long-time member of that club; terminate
his membership. Neither does the Station’ want him to be too.
obvious in giving the cold shoulder to the Soviet. The Station .

. does not believe, knowing what it knows of LOGINOV, that
serious and permanent damage has been done “to LIREALN-1's .
security and believes that he can continue to provide valuable

services to this Station.

that he had hoped to be able to see ond Ay

1620 ROWTON then telephoned, FRADYER's office (in
lias, open code, and double talk) and this
"time managed to reach FRADYER himself; FRADYER
told RONTON ‘that he had the-moncy and could
pass"it to RONTON that same afternoon, if he.

“felt. it’ necessary, ROWTON Feplied that he

fo preferred to-pick it up-as soon as.conveatent
:for FRADYER and ‘made a date for 1630 in the
corridor outside the Koala Restaurant, about
three or four minutes by: foct from Sanborns.'
ROWTON then asked LIRBALN-1 to wait’ for him
in the downstairs bar of Sanborns, where he

- would join’him.with the monéy, LIREALN-1
left ROVTON's home alone, ‘and ROWTON followed
about five minutes later and proceeded (by
taxi) to the Koala Restaurant. . ROWTON
distinctly recalls waiting fox  FRADYFR for
some 15 minutes. 7

1645° ROWTON spoke with FRADYER for about two
: ginutes in the corridor after receiving the
envelope containing the money. In reply to
_.‘ FRADYER's queries, ROWTON-stated ‘that LIREALN-1
was somewhat disappointed ‘that he could.not
provide him with some sort of written contract
for. LIRELIC-1 and also because of the delay in
yeimbursing him for operational expeises (some
-of- which had been disallowed). ROWTON then
pu revealed, to FRADYER that LIREALM-1 was waiting
7 : for. him atthe Sanborns bar so that he Could
pass him the moncy without further delay.
-FRADYER then regretted that he had ‘beén unable
to see LIREALN-1 personally to explain‘the, - ~~
‘disallowance of some of the expenses. © ROWTON
Suggested that FRADYER might take this
opportunity to say a few words to LIREALN-1,
especially since the latter, knew that RONTON
- and FRADYER were meeting at that moment
ue somewhere nearby. FRADYER agreed but said
that he prefezred thé gift section of Sanborns

to the bar.

-1655:. ROVTON then proceéded alone to the downstairs

: bar of Sanborns and ‘found LIREALM-1 waiting.

* ROWTON-explained that he was late because of
a last-minute arrangement with FRADYER for a
brief meeting in the gift shop. LIREALI1
then paid the bill and accompanied ROWTON up
the stairs in the rear to the gift section,
where they found FRADYER looking over the
silver display in the shop.

1700 ‘An apparently casual conversation then took
place, with FRADYER and LIREALN-1 doing most
of the talkifig and with RONTON occasionally
examining the silverware on display.

4. LIREALN-2 also aniplified his writton report sub=
sequently in one.significant detail, In reference to the |
ronark of LOGINOV to the offect that he had ‘scen’ him with his
boss at Sanborns two Wednesdays previously when "you had a’ - :
; drink in the bar aitd then talked to your boss," LIREALM=1 told
: ROWTON on reflection that LOGINOV had also stated that "you :

were having a drink at the bar and a man came up to you and
“brought you to your -boss." This indicates that FRADYER was
: meant ‘as the person described ns LIREALM-1's boss.

5, With regard to where and how often ROWTON and

_ LIREALN-1 have had'operational mootings in the past, as
requested in paragraph 3 of Yeference B, Station files show L
that between: 20-October 1967 and 16 January 1968 ROWTON met

with LIREALM-1 at his home ten times,’ Besides thesd meetings
with LIREAL'-1 at his home, ROWTON recalls only two other moctings °
With LIREALM-1, when he picked up LIREALH-1 in his. car for brief
meetings to pass him funds. Since the LOGINOV/LIREALM-1

episode, ROWTON: has’met. with LIREALN-1 at obscure, bars . to avoid.
possible positive identification of ROWTON.in tho event ©

EIREALM-1 was under .surveillance, ‘LIREALM-1 has passed his -- _
reports to ROWTON between their weckly meetings via a P.O :
letter drop taken‘ out previously by LIREALN+] under alias.
The only telephone contact that has existed between them has
been brief calls to ROWION's homo by LIREALN-1 alerting ROWTON,

in double talk, that he has left an envelope at the drop, ” :

6. With regard to the frequericy of LIREALN-1's meetings
with LOGINOV,..mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference By
LIREALN-1's contact reports list only four meetings during
the same period, all.of which occurred at the French Club, and
one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at
Qhich very few words were exchanged. It is significant to note,
however, that at the 12 November 1967 mecting,- while LIREALMe1 :
and LOGINOV were chatting in the showers after the match, the
latter "joked that (LIREALN-1) should bring some of his friends

from the Embassy" to join them in playing tennis. LOGINOV
added, also apparently with a slight grin, "all of them are
WOFIRI." FRADYER, to whom ‘this remark was promptly reported,
did not consider it to’ have any special meaning since he knew
from personal and direct experience that LOGINOV is a born
provocateur who cannot resist needling people (Mexicans and
foreigners) with whom.he comes into contact. . WOFIRM often
comes up in LOGINOV conversations, not only with FRADYER, but
with persons of other nationalities, It was decided, however,
to again warn LIREALN-1 at his next meeting with ROWTON

on 16 November, when LIREALM-1 submitted his report, not to
{avolve himself with LOGINOV. LIREALM-1 assured ROWTON that

1967-Subject and severai other Soviets visited ZAREBSKI's
factory and had lunch with him in Cuernavaca, On 20.

May 1967 Subject and Boris Aleksandrovich CH¥YKHOV

15 July 1967 Subject and CHMYKHOV visited the factory. (19)

. (COMMENT: Subject and CHNYKHOV had known each other
before “In Cuba, and both had mestkom responsibilities for
the dacha, so their golng to Cuernavaca together is not
remarkable, although CHMYKHOV 1s a GRU officer.)

“CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT. t
- DATE-OF MEETING: 12 December 1967°

fade 1. A Headquartors.officer made arrangements by telephone for
7 _ sme to interview Subject on 12 Decoiiber, She was told that I would ©
H arrive at ‘Toledo at -10:30-and call her; However, ay plane developed
mechanical trouble and I called her. from Pittsburg to advise that
T- would be 3 hours late, I arriyed-at Toledo at 13:30 and called
“her, Fe agreod that I would como to-he¥ mother's apartment at-14:30.
The interview lasted. frou 14:30 to 18:30, During the last hour we
were joined ‘by her mother but, since slie‘is senile and hard of
dtc we were able to continuu talking without interruption, {

iat Pui | “introduced myself as Peter Clark tron the Embassy in |
Mexico, Subject. accepted me without question and immediately began
telling her story which was about the. sume as wo bad received from
the political officor, The telling took only. 10 mimites, I-had. ~
“considerable difficulty in taking her through a chronological account
and holding her to one subject. It. became obvicus that she is.a :
very self-centered pérson who is not interested in others unless
they make-a strong impression on her which LOGINOV. obviously did:

She ig. impdssible on name: dates or tines, asking me at least three
tines during the interview to repeat my name. On -tho other hand - i
she.was completely cooperative. and did not appear to be ‘withholding

[or ‘ distorting information.

ay - .t¥om her chaotic’ account and, thus, is by no-meana perfect: | -

&. She was in Hexico about 10 days on her most recent trip
and.ti@t LOGINOV about a .Week ‘before sho left (ca.10.November). She

- Frederico MARIN (see below) had been invited, It was.a large party
* which included ‘Mexicans, foreigners and diplomats. She met “LOGINOV
“"* through a German man whom she had just met (van ‘Henrichs or Kendrichs,
no meaningful traces.) She talked to LOGINUV oh and off,for an hour.
- After an éxchange of amenities she remarked that-he spoke’ good English, |
“He said it needed improvement and°*asked if she would be willing to . ‘
give him lessons, She, would like to but must leave in a week. He =
asked 1f she. had any American friends who could teach him. .She

several times that she would cooperate, completely. She is clearly not
suitable for a long-term or complicated relationship with LOGINOY but
could be used on'a short term basis to introduce another, person or |

to be an instrumeat in a provocation,

“9, At the conclusion of the interview, Subject was told that,

although she had every reason to ititerpret events as she did, LOGINOV -

specializes in‘ contacting and developing Americans as he did her.
From her story, there was no reason to believe that ho was displaying
vulnerabilities, Therefore we have no reason for her to attempt to
prolong the relationship or cultivate him, On the other hand she hag
to contact him in order to get back her manuscript. She is not to
suggest further contact but is to report to us any further contact

‘The LNPURE officer also informed.the, cnse officer that Subject had
proviousiy mentioned that he hnd once been “approached” to supply
Tnformation on Soviet travelers on ‘a regular basis and had refused

to do so. Subject evidently did not spocifically say that he had

from_24-29 October, A meeting. was, consequently arranged: with: Subject,
for 28 Septenber through the LAP! fticer, =: Soeueeeta|

“4, Subject™'told the Station officer who met him that he had
been meaning to contact the Stati ut his forthcoming trip, which,
he. said, he assamed was what ‘the case officer wanted ‘to talk about.
He gave the case officer 1 copy of his invitation to the Intourist _ -
conference and on his own initiative offered to: provide ‘the’ Station
-gith a ‘full report’ of the conference when ho returned. However, he
stated that-he was not intorested in working for the Station on a ~
permanent, "agent" basis, insmeeting under clandestine circwmstances,
or taking money. Hé. was willing to belp to the extent he was, he
explained, because he believed basically what we did about current -
world-problens and, after all, had lived. in WOLADY for many years and
regarded it ne his “second home", On the basis of this. interview
and.a review of Subject's. file’,- Subject. impressed the case officer
ag a somewhat disingenuous egoist pho, despite a genuine sydpathy.
for WOLADY, regarded his cooperation vith: the Station. prizarily asa
means of inguring his. business Contacts with LNPURE and as sonething
which had to be kept ‘to a gihimun lest 1t “limit his independdnce or
detract hin in anyway from his business and personal interests.

This impression served as. the basis for the evaluation of Subject

contained in Reference A.

5... The’ cies officer's impression of Subject changed considerably
with the noxt meoting, which-was held on 18 October. At this meeting,
the case officer-gave Subject:a defensive briefing for his. trip and. .
went over genoral roporting requirenents. ‘Subject surprised the case
Officer with his friendliness and cooperativeness, and went to great
pains to explain that he wes more than willing. to cooperate with the
Station as long did not -become so deeply involved in intelligence

work that his bua: :

officer and assured ‘him that his cooperation in supplying such infor~
mation would not involve him in a series of escalating intelligence
pesignments, Evidently satisfied that his role would remain a limited
one, Subject agreed to roport the desired information on a regular
basis, Moreover, he volunteered to check with other travel agencies
in order to fulfill specific requirements for information on travelers
to the Soviet ‘Union who did not book their travel through his agency.

6. Subject was thoroughly debriefed upon his return fron the
USSR in early November 1966, st-which time he continued to exhibit
the samo friendlinoss and cooperativeness noted in paragraph five.
Be reported that -he.was aware of no effort to assess, cultivate, or
compromise bin in the USSR. He- provided information both on the
formal ‘proceedings of the conference and on individual Soviet ‘2nd
foreign participants, 1c teil as om a Spanish businesswan he met in
Moscou. This’ information resulted in’ three Field Information Reports

: Subject, their relationship during. the past -year-has“been ‘strictly of ©
‘|  g°buginess nature.and LOGINOV Has shown no" interest in extending it
beyond this, Subject consequently appears to have little to offer
in tho. way of, an access. agent to the Soviets in the foreseeable”
future.. However, as thé manager of one of five Hoxican travel
agencies represonting Intourist and because of his apparently al
excellent contacts with Key personnel of the other four travel agencies,
he profiises to be a-useful referent on persons who book travel in.”

‘ | 8. Despite the regularization of our relationship with Subject
i _ and his increased ccoperativendss, wa do not feel wé-are currently.

in.a position to sak-bim to undergo an SGSWIRL interview. “The '
relationship between the case officer and Subject at this tine 18
essentially one of equals 4n which Subject is voluntarily assisting
LNFORT out-of tdedlogical motivation.. It 1s true that his strong
businese Ahterest ‘in maintaiiing friendly rolationg with LNFORT
_and LNPURE provides us with a degree of control, but we feel that at
present: it is better loft ag a form of tacit control than brandished
éven subtly} It, 4s our opinion that Subject would regard an SGSWIRL
iiterview as an effort both to-trcrease our control over bim and to
drsw him:deoper into the intelligence business. Such a reaction
would in all probability undo much of our recent progress with
Subject; Consequently, we would prefér’to postpone an SGSWIRL
dniterview until either we further solidify our relationship with
Subject or we wish to use bili in more ‘sensitive vork.

introduced te LOGINOV, by BEWKEP, They again were together at
the Polish Babassy on’ 4 October 1966, Although BESABER has,
not told BEWEEP of his meet with LOGINOV on 13 January it is
only because BESABER has not.seen BEWEEP sifce before Christmas.
BESABER has -been instructed to be perfectly open with BEWZEP
about having seen LOGINOV and in fact it way turn out that
LOGINOV and BEWEEP will visit BESABER together. (LOGIKOV
referred to the possibility in his 13 January meet with BESABER).
