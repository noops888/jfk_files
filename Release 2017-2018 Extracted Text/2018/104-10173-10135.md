MEMO OF CONVERSATION

Lulla RELAVAL, Visa Olieur of U.S. Entassy.

1. I talked to Lella today about her contact with the Sovier who brought

BAZAROV's passport In for a visa yesterday. She Identifled the Soviet from

a photograph as Valent in SergeyevIch LOGINOV, and sald that he is always

the one who comes to the U.S. Embassy for visas.. She did nor recognize:

the photograph of Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, the Vice Consul.

Actually, Lella believed that LOGINOV was a Vice Consul, sald she always

asks'for him as such when she has to call the Soviet Embassy.

A 2. Apparently yesterday was not the first time that LOGINOV has tried

to make a date with Letla. She says that he always asks her what she does

in her free cime, and that she has put him off by saying that she is very busy.

Once shexx he asked her whether she spent her free time with other people

ax from the Embassy and was surprised to hear that she usually spends her

off bours with non-Embassy friends. Yesterday LOGINOV again asked hér

what she did in the evenings, and she said she was especlally busy now

because she lias started taking guitar lessons.

•He mentioned some Soviet

dance group that was coming to Moxico in a month.or so and sald he would

like to invite her to go to sce them with him. He also told her he was not

marrled. Lella sald she did not refuse the Invitation outright but said chat

she did not know whether she would be free when they carne or not.

3. I told Leila a few of the facts of Soviet life: that all Soviets have to

be marrled in order to go overseas, that LOGINOV Is-a KGB. officer and

was obvlously trying to get his foot in the door of the U.S. Embassy through

her, that he'was unisubtedly disappointed to hear that she did not spend

all her free time with other Embassy people, etc. Leila has evluently been

unsure about how to react to: LOGINOV's advances, has not wanted to be

rude to him, and seemed relleved when I suggested that she simply decline

his invitations by always being busy. She says she does not like his slick

manner at all, and I gather that she has felt uneasy in having to deal with

him,, but now that someone has told her how to react she will have no problem.

4. Lella mentioned that LOGINOV knows English but Is reluctant co

He once read off the visa stamped in a passport in peffect English,

and he also read a copy of the new visa regulations in English (to himself,

but evidently understanding ir all). According to the new regulations,

Sovlets no longer need visas for continuous iransit of the U.S. (I.e., on the

same flight), but LOGINOV insisted on gerting a visa for BAZAROV in spite

of this. (This Is confirmed in LIENVOY.) --

local supporters of the extreme left such as Cordero Amndor, the

I arrived somewhat late,

Kas Somerto the ambassador from Finland

was present and so was the mayor general Natahn Aferl from Ghang,.

the ambassador was most friendly as well as Jan Hant the commercial

counsellor and Jirl Minstrun Sveetka the second secretery In

charge o the consulat.

Next day we went to the. Soviet embassy for the exhibition of

a filiwhose title I think was the father of the soldier, a rather

childish film but that brought tears to the eyes of some of the

embassy wives who attended. There was an small group of people,

including tome army officere from the Secretary de la Defensa,

and Hairal Azanor Cetina, subsecretarlo de sarina, and entral:

otal Bricelo, who after a long illness has now sone new post in

Marina. All the Soviet star was present, there were two or three

cuban including Curvello. There was a change, the doorsof the

embassy were wide open and there was no question by the people

the visitors. There was as usual plenty ofukad vodka, txaxmn small

Very few people were there, which is not; curprising

in view of the bad quality of their food and poor service. But:

for a quick bite.

Loguinov was very much interested in knowing what my Us

friende thought about. the situation in the Middle Eat

and what

they would do about it. He was insistent about the possible help

that the us would give to Israel, he said that the US had already

given Israol a considerable amount of armunition and planes, and

specially money, the Unss had to give some help to the arabe in

view of the help siven to Israel. According to him there was not

the alighest doubt that Israel had been the agressor. The URSS

would never consent to any territorial gains. by Israel.

During our conversation about food, specially about seafood

he lot It be know/that he had been in Mazatlán everal times.

He said that everything which had taken place in the Middle

1. liy last meeting with subjoct was on 23 larch, at

which time she agreed to provide information on LoGINov

obtained during their normal business contact and iny further

social contact initiated by himö. She was to call me after

their next date..or

any other cignificant contact she hind with

him. Sinco I had not heard from her, I called her at her

apartment about 2115 on 11 May. I apologized for calling so

Late, but

said I had juit got out of work and had a package

for her i had brought hack from the States which I

wanted

to deliver before the contents got stile, Could I drop over

that night or perhaps another evening Subject immediatel

recognized the "package" as the Benson and Hedges cigarettes

I had promised her, gently protested, and then told me she

whe

not feeling weil, but the doctor had told her she had

" to eat, and it so happened she was just going out for a bite::

when I called. I consequently suggested we have dinner together,

which we did from 2145-1215 at the Gondola. Afterwerds, wo

went

around the corner to her apartment for a nightcap until

0200.

?. Subject had lost 8 or 10 pounds and looked a bit thin

and not as attractive as I had remembered her. She told me

she was simoly working too hard and not eating and sleeping

properly. I had come fear that she might have had come second

thoughts in the seven wecks since she had agreed to cooperate,

but it proved unfounded. She this time was relaxed from the

start, was very friends, and

seemed to onloy the opportunity

to set out. (She later told me in her apartment that she didn't

5o out much, liked to spend her evenings at home reading.

listoning to records, tending to her dwarf trees, ete.) she

wide it clear from the start that she hadn't changed her mind

by werning me half-geriously and half-playfully that I shouldn't

think I could "ouy" her with sifts..

"you've bought mo up here,"

she said, tapping her head with her forefinger. "That's

the only way you'll get anywhere with mo." Most of the evening

was spent in general and (especially back at her apartment)

Increasingly fuzzy discussion of Israel, the Jews, her job,

the RussIans "as people," her very humanintic philosophy about.

exactly remember what else.

She is definitely

a mart girl, but I think less profound and sophisticated than

she tries to appear.

Otherwise, she seems to be a very sincero

person, and she has given me no reason to doubt or suspect

anything she has told me.

3o: Contact with TOGTOV. Subject said she hadn't been

out with LOGINOy since our last meeting and had had onty one

Ince-to-lace contact with him.

She said this was a little

over a month ago (early April) and was

occasioned by ker

cflorts to help a client bo the name of Dr. Jury AUTHUR set

a soviet visa..

an official Soylet invitation to vialt the USSR. As lt turned

out, however, he nau a nard ture evei gutting a soviet visa.

Subject Iinally called LoGIN'i herself to try to push things

Blong. but TOGINOV showed no willingness to racilitate things.

(LIENVOY hes Subject on the phone to LOCINOV on 5 April.

After disoussing KVITLER's case, Subjeet, remarked to LOGINOY

that she understood that "you. (ustedes) must have some reason

not to want to give him (KUTTISR) the viar." LOGINOY replled

that there were "reasons enough,")

Ho A day on two after her telephone conversation with Loosior,

subject said

she went over to the Soviet Imbassy personally to

see If she could got anywhere with LOGINOV.

LoatNov received

her cordially, and for the first time asked her into his

office (she said it was the first office off the outside

Reception Room), She egain asked LOGIVOr. to try to stretast

speed up the granting of KUrTLiP's VIsa. LOGINOY hermed and

hawed, Indicating that he wasn't even sure the yisa would be

granted.

Fe finally told Subject that look, he had gore to

Kurtlar for dental work once, and turfer had charged hin sued

too much. Consequently, he said, he wasn't going to give bia

a visa.

subject said she could not tell it the destist pill

was the real reason for LOGINOVly nogative attitude, but kbea

she persisted; LOGINOV finally relented and the following

exchange ensued:

jut you KnoW, & favoI

must be repaid by a favor.

Subject:

"All right....in thát case, let me in the name

of the company invite you

to dinner."

LOGINOV:

"No,

I don't mean that.":

roGINoy then went on to say that as he had mentioned to her

before, he

would like her to Introduce hin to "someone who

would be simpathetic to us" (1.f., to the Soviets). LOGINOV

emphanired that he realited subject might not agree with this

"someone's" ideas, but stated that he krew subject was the

type of person no "had respect for other people's views.""

subject said that she replied in a casual, almost flinpant

ranner that "well, sure, if she net such a person, she'd

Introduce them." With this the eibject was dropped and subject

left.

Se Htc0zr-5. Subject on her own initiative began telling

me what a terrifle guy her bosg 19.

He according to her, has

one of the most winning personalities of aryone she has

ever

met.

it.the same time he is extremely intelligent and shrewd.

"If he can't get what he wants through cham, he does It by

pure sarewdness." This 1s why he is such a successful businessman.

In reply to a question about LICOZI-5's baciground, Subject

said he had tien born in toland, was imprisoned by either the

roles or Germans just before or during world war II (abo was

rather vague on this point, ard I confined myself to listening),

sorehow got out and joined the Russians, taking part in the

soviet Invasion of cemany. Sonehow he hed survired all this,

The conversation was the most relaxed as well as the

ruralest back at Subject's apartment, where ve finished a bottle

Of vodka LOGINOy had given LiCOt-s and LICOEX-S had given her.

Baöke on the

subject of roarov, subject said she "supposed""

he had tried to cultivute a lot of girls lika herself... "hadn't

her?" (I had told. Subject at our last meeting that young worren

were among LodINov's favorite targets, but hadnot been able to

tell what offect this "revolation" had on her. Now it appeared

that it had hit home and that it had wounded her pride to

think he not only had had ulterior motives in dating her, but

had dated other girls the same way.) I didn't reply directly,

but said something about LOGINOV bring as

smooth as they come.

subject warn't satisfied with this, however, and pressed me:

"lie hag

tried the same thing with other giris, hasn't he?"'

"Yes,L

there was to their folationship. Thatls absolutely all there

Interest in politics.

Sho had her own life to lead, and what

one side said made no more dent in her than what the other side

sa1d. - Reflecting for a moment on the above, subject then added

almost aisgustedly that when she began seeing LOGINOY she had

Gerrany, He spoke some English.

To The appearence of AlVASiZ, who by now was ordering his

first of two martiniss seemed to end any remaining chances of

setting anywhere with the girl. As It worked out, however,

his appearance had just the opposite effect, because it provided

more than an hour of conversation on an ingreasingly frierdly"

and personal level.: sy her second drink, Subject was even

managing a few laughs....

Eventually we got onto the subjeot.of

Israel, which, thanks to the Information supplied by LIcozY 5,

I knew she had visited and had become romantically involved

with, she herseir being half Jewish.. I expressed considerable

Interest in her trip and Israel in general, and she geemod

delighted to toil ze about both. It then turred out that her

mother who Subject sald Is a U.S. citizen-had lived In Moldavia;

had told her daughter vivid stories of pogroms carried out by

the Russians assings the Jews, and had fled Rumania before tho

Invading Russiang (evidently during World War II.) The fact

that I had been in Rumanie and Moldavia was good for another

ten minutes of conversation and seemed to Irpress Sublect far

beyond its worth.

In any event, by the time ALVAPEZ left,

Subjoat and I were on a first rare basis and she

was telling me

how glad she was she had met me--all of which I attribute to

tone how I could have ever suspected ker of cooperating with

LOGINOV. No, she just couldn't inderstand it. I replied that

I hadn't suspected her and reminded her that I hadn't said i

bothered me, however.

On the one hand, she told me she loved

Mexico and rogarded the Uis. as her second country;. jet on the

other, she clalmed to be totally apolitical. The Soviets In

Mexico, I repeated, were working to undermine both countries,

and proceeded to go over, again much of what I had said earlior.

I stated that it was Incredible to ne that soviet activities in.

12. There are clearly two essentials If Subject 1s to

develop into a worthwhile asset. First she is going to have to

come up with nore Intereating observations than slmoly that

LOGINOV 1s smart.

Sho may be able to do this by becoming a

more diligent and careful observer which I think she 1s

capablo of or 1t may require an effort on her part to develos

a closer relationship with LOGINOV. One possiblilty in the

latter direction 1s to prevall upon her to become more intimate

with Lodriov than she now appears to be. On the basis of

LICOZY-Sis opinion that

she probably sleeps around, this might

be possible, although 1t 18 much too early to saj. second,

Subject must prove cooperativo.

Sho strikes me as a very independent

and strong willed person; and there is no guarantee

she won't

change sissa her mind

or do only what sho leols Ilke doing.

It 1s also possible that In a moment of reconsideration, she

might confido in LiCozt-5. In which case her credibility would

become tangled with his.

that he thought she should go and therefore he was making her

an honorary Soviet consul. Subject sold that was fine with her

and she'd see him at. the Home Show. (I told Smbjeet on 28

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Cocktail Party with Official

•Bloc Representatives

• At a party giyen by the local head of the Consula!

Corps Association on 28 June, the undersigned met and agair

chatted with Valentin S. LOCINOY of the Soviet Embassy..

also met for the

first time Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy

who

was Introduced to undersigned by LOGINOV.

As USual LOGINOV spent most of the time converaing

with

undersigned provocating him on a nümber of issues..

undersigned answered, making a few similar comments about the

Chinese Civil War.

Then LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undereigned

felt it would be nice if the Soviets helped the U.S. to

bring peace to that area so they could concentrate more-on

the Chinese Communist danger.. At one point in the conversation

undersigned Jokingly. asked LOGINOV if there were Soviét

nationals in North Vietnam.

The latter said,

"sure, we have

many advisors there."

undersidnged said,

110g..

what he

meant was behind guns or'in the seats of airplanes." •LOGINOV

said absolutely not.

It also seems that LOGINOV has been

keeping track of the people' he sees undersigned talking with

at cocktail

parties.

For example, LOGINOV was curious to

know if undersigned has seen

"his Haitian friend$."

Undersigned

asked which one the black one of the white one. LodIno

satd.thet

wbite one, referring to the Haitian Vice Consul whom

undersigned occasionally talks to

Undersigned said he had

seen the Haitian 'at the Haitian, National Day about a month

ago but noted that the only Soviet present at that party was

ANDREYEV, not LOGINOV. " The latter, incidentally, corners

the Haitlans' anytime he. has a chance

to, although he officially

poo poos the Haitian regime. 'LOGINOV once more asked under

signed when he would come play tennis with him (this is about

the fourth

or fifth time):

Undersigned told him he would do

so after he gets invited by LOGINOV as the latter has often

promised to do.

One of the topics that LOGINOV mentioned

was the Protection Section of the Embassy. "Protection against

On

the ne be on our c feel de their problems.

the usual lowdown:

LOGINOV must have been interested in the section as he

mentloned

that a U.S. Vice-Consul working in that section whom he had

JAKOWIEC appears to be

man who likes to talk. His

Spanish 1s quast bi-lingual and JAKONIEC says, by the way,

that he

learned it in Brazil:

Polish-looking woman. Her

at some of the exchanges between LOGINOV and the undersigned.

Both Mr. and Mrs: JAKOWIEC appear to speak fluent Russian.

At one point in the conversation undersigned mentioned there.

is hardly a Pole in Poland who does not have a relative in

the United States; JAKOWIEC agreed and commented that while the

Poles are close to Americans in many things they are not so

pleased at other things that the U.S. does.

Undersigned

deferred this discussion of this point for another meeting.

As many of the Consular. Corps members know that undersigned

served many years in Vietnam,

the latter felt that he should

not hide this fact to the official bloc representatives as

they would find out about it anyway.

This came out for the

first time on the occasion of this cocktail party when

JAKOWIEC somehow mentioned Vietnam and the efforts of the

Polish members of the Armistice Commission there..

The

undersigned, who has known a number of these people quite well,

told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish as

they were sons of Polish emigrants to France who returned to

Poland after Gomulka took power®

When JAKOWIEC started to

imply that this indicates how wonderful

things were in Poland,

undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees,

many of whom worked under very difficult conditions in France

in the coal mines, preferred the hard work to the chance of

working in Communist Poland:

The next cocktail party held by the Consular Assn®

will probably

be held

at the Soviet Embassy.

The President

of the Association

told

undersigned that LOGINOV had asked him

for his agreement to hold the next party at his Embassy.

large attendance of official bloc representatives can therefore

be expected at the next get-together.:

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1. This is a new, experimental version of the Persônality Assessment

Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ Ill) which has been in

use for several years.

This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires

far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.

a. For. a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de

raloping a system for indirect assessment of target personalities

The

system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations

of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such observations are

used as it they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are

weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile: Working from the

profile, operctional psychologists describe the 'target personality's basic

aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities.

The goal of the assess-

ment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.

3. Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete

this questionnaire independently.

All items need not be completed; in fact;

it. is a rare case. where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are

encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking.

Mark such

items with a "G." instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, an

observer with very limited contact can be expècted to enter more "G's'

than

"X's."

Overall impression of eating and smoking behavior. (Check the

most appropriate description.)

A hearty eater with well defined preferences. He eats and smokes

with considerable gusto but tends to be a little on the coarse ánd

boorish side. It is rather easy to imagine him eating huge sand-

wiches and drinking beer with the boys it the neighborhood bar. —

A heavy eater with limited preferences. Me eats and smokes

with gusto but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish.

It is rather easy to imagine him becoming quite sharp with a

waiter who serves him unfamiliar foril or a dish prepared in

an unfamiliar way.

A sensual eater who knows all the restaurants and their native

specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he

has discovered. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors his

smokes, .and though rarely gauche, he is more aware of his

food than his manners. It is easy to imagine him cooking and

serving special dishes to his friends.

A sensual eater who tends to eat by himself when possible.

He seems to eat all types of food and has something of the

air of a glutton about him. He eats with obvious pleasure,

savors his smokes and afterwards will linger alone at a toble

with self-satisfaction; It is easy to imagine him hovering

alone over the buffet at a cocktail party savoring the tidbits.

A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd.

He probable has food allergies that prevent him from eating

certain foods. - He gives the impression. of enjoying smoking

more than eating but his table manners are adapted to what

ever situation he is in. It is easy to imagine him taking an.

indigestion pill in the privacy of his room.

A conventional eater who always goes along with the crowd.

He eats with little relish and rarely mentions anything about

his likes or dislikes. He smokes at every opportunity, but.

more mechanically than with pleasure. He usually tries to

adapt his manners to the situation but may be a little awkward

and obvious in doing so.

It is easy to imagine him grabbing a

bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.

A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated

food tastes. Dining is quite a ritual with him, and atmo

sphere and service are almost as important as the food. He

is graceful and cultüred at table and smokes in the same

manner. It is easy to imagine him dressing for dinner, en

joying fine wines and food by candlelight.

An unconventional eater, a man who "eats like a bird."

He eats in a preoccupied way, obviously indifferent to

his food and surroundings. It would not be surprising to

etc.).

None of these descriptions really fit.

Is there anything special about his drinking habits that requires

A hearty, heavy drinker who holds his liquor well. He is

always rather boisterous, and when he drinks, there is little

change in behavior.

A heavy drinker who often gives the impression he can drink

others under the table: When he drinks, there is little change

in behavior, but there is a hint that he could get quite mean

if provoked.

A steady drinker who obviously enjoys being "sight."' In a way.

he can be somewhat charming when drunk and car get away

with a bit of the "'life of the party" routine.

A steody drinker who becomes somewhat more maudlin when

drunk or tight. Tends to tell people how much he likes them

and sometimes asks others whether they like him. Gives an

impression that he could become quite disgusting if he got

very drunk.

A steady drinker who holds his liquor very well. He ali

ways remairs quite dignified and usually maintains his poise :

even though others are becoming quite drunk or tight. He

still remains part of the crowd, however that is, he gives

few signs of being disgusted or bored.

A light drinker who paces his drinks. He seems to drink only

because it is socially necessary. As a party progresses he

tends to become aloof and distant. Is likely to continue to

talk about his work even when it is inappropriate.

A light drinker who tapers off as the evening progresses.

Usually manages to keep a sophisticated oloofness from

others. Often singles out and associates with someone

rather like himself. As the party progresses,, he shows

obvious distaste for anything he considers crude or bois

ferous. Often becomes quite sarcastic about others'

behavior.:

A very light drinker who either drinks only because he

has to or refuses to drink at all. Is usually not really

a part of the party and is obviously annoyed when others

bring him in against his wishes. Tends to be solitary

and sometimes will leave unobtrusively when the oppor

tunity presentsa

None of these descriptions really fit.

time, his good humor, is contagious.

He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with con-

siderable gusto. However, he is frequently dour and sometimes

con do a good job appropriately livening up a party: Although

something of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.

He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent persor

who, at times, con be surprisingly gay and carefree However

when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and couses some strain for

those around him. His humor is often clever but he con be

quite sarcostic and ever biting on occasion:

He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appro

priate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless, person,

but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi-

cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way..

he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied

than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.

He is a dour and húmorless person, always serious and intense.

It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re-

sponsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.

He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow. with a subtle wit. He

can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.

However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his

sense of humor and he.can be quite condescending towards

peoplé who do not understand or appreciate his serise of humor.

He is an arty, somewhat cynical person who con be quite

flippant at times. His humör tends to be a bit far out. He

seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates.. If is

women he admires. He often. uses flattery and compliments

but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his

attentiveness.

He is a sensual person, but is embarrässed and insecure about

it. He is a rather soft man who iries härd to be inoffensive.

However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his

eyes when he thinks no one is looking: He is also prone fo.

•brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets

o: chance.

He is o self-confident, rather polished person who is proper

and conventional with either men or women. He is always

considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to

ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.

In.agroup, he always.behaves according to protocol and

usually can be quite efficient in doing so.

He is a self-confident and precise person who has something

of the air of ó professional man about him. 'He is polite;

almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to

light d woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken

care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in

his relations with women. Somelimes his formality is out

of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners

or procedures to fit the situation.

He is a charming, urbane person and both friendly: and:

sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way.

but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness:

He is neat, even dapper, and can, be quite fastidious.

Most of his relations with women appear. to be quite pla

tonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several

very close friends who are wömen.

He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom some

people consider odd'or unusual. He shows little or no

interest in women in public. In general, he is a preoc

cupied person who only seeks out people with similar

* interests. There is an ascetic, asexual air about him

most of the time.

On 29 January 1969, Samuel J. KARTASUK not with Subject to

Subject initially

refused to cooperate on the grounds that he does not want to get

involved in this type of business and that he had given the same

answer to "the other side.". He readily admitted that he has been

under intensive development by Valentin LOGINÓV (201-285412) to spot

Mexican students wbo eventually may go to OLADY; he denied, however,

that he has ever accepted the money LOGINOY continually offers him.

Subject volunteered

that Yurty. CHERNYSH (201-825743) is currently

developiag one of Subject's students (which we knew), and that Subject

woüld like to foll CHERNYSH's attempt.

In spite of Subject'e expressions of reluctance to be recruit

he anawered a number of questions put to him by KARTASUK and he

agreed to a follow-up meeting

on T February. At that meeting, he

submitted to more intensive questioning about his background, family,

and his association with the FJSTEAl community.

There were no ettempts

it evasion and many of his answers were corroborated by information

that ras already known trom uther sources. Subject agreed to continue!

meeting clandestinely with KARTASUK and to provide additional

Information

on his contacts with LOGINOV and other menbers of the kGB.

Subject's'activities immediately following the pitch vere

monitored closely by LIEKBRACK and by LIFKAT for the week between the

two meetings.

The "second meeting sas counter-surveilled with negative

results.: Although the recruitment is still. tenuous, we believe that

it can be firaly ceninted and that Subject is committed whether or

not be is ready to admit it to hinselt at this point.

Transmitted herewith is a report prepared by Keith

Buerba, a teacher at the Mexican

North American Cultural Institute

in Mexico City.

The Soviets

have long had an interest in the Institute and its personnel

because most of newly arrived Americans study Spanish there.

GAZIYEV has

attended the Institute since his arrival in Mexico,

first studying Spanish and then English.

We are forwarding this report because it is a typical

illustration oi LOGINOV's modus operandi and becnuse it clearly.

shows that GAZIYEV at least has the status of a KGB cooptee.

LOG: "OK, until the next then."

6 From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was

probably talking about subject, since;

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North

American Institute and I knew from Subjoct that Subject had had

• GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted

with GAZIYeV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject

an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviot Embassy (although

subject told me he had not gone).

(b) subject had gotten married that month.

(c). Subject had just returned to Mexico with his bride.

(d) subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.

(o) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800.

to teach evoring Spanish classes.

7 Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had

considered using Subject as an

access agent against GAZIYEV;

but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless

there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was

developing into something more than occasional chats between

classes.

I did not see much potential in approaching subject

before this with shetad the idea of having him deliverately

cultivate a friendahip with GAZIYEV, as I felt Subject was living

such a busy and hectic life that I would get very littlo out

of him. Prior to bla marriago, ho wis kroping such a hectic

schédule botween his Institute and private classes that ho

wasn't sleeping or eating proporly and was having increasing

problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health

problems increased after his marrlage and his taking of the

Job with the Amorican School (although he gave up most of hid

private classes).

8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's

relations with

the Soviets look much more interesting, I

attempted

to find out what I could about them from subjoct.

Por a number

of reasons, howevor-Including my,going to the States in June

wo were not ablo to get together, until ll July. On that date

I took subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a ilttio

Spanish restaurant downtown.

1: 1

9 The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.

I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would

voluntarily toll me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had

developed any further.. When I casually brought the conversation

around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV

was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally

chatted with him' in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one

of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between

the: two evening classes.

Subject commented that he enjoyed

talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, Interesting guy,

as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that

they never talked polltics.. In reply to an offhand question

about whether he had mot any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject

said that ho had

_note My inclination was to bellovo Subjoct, and

I went away thinking that ofther GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been

talking about someone else over

the phone. or that they had

never gone boyond the stage of simply talking about subject.

20.

On 1 Nyember 1967, I ran Into Subject and his brother

Javlor In Sanborne-Insurgentes, They were about to have a

quick

lunch and Inolsted that I Join them for a cup of coffee.

As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and

would like my advico.

Ho said GAZIYEY had givon him an invitation

to the 7 November colobration of the Rovolution at the Sovlot

Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,

he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black

11st" at tho U.S. Embassy If he went.

He said that he had

tried to cali me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to

ask my advice, but had boen told I was out of town. (I was in

El Paso from 25-29 October.

He stated that if he had not been

able. to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply

walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security

department" about his predicament. what did I think he should

do?

11. I told Subjoct to relax and forget about going to the

U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any adrice

other than to toll him that it was entirely his own business

whother he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I

asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a

"black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know

how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew the VaS.

Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of

the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even 1f the U.3. Embassy

molised to Elve him any adoleo, at least it would make are

of nto visit ard anyona who tas ever interestod haule hea

hoart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't

afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.

Aftor all, he had an American wifo, he might want to go to the

States to study sometime; and they might even want to go to

the Statos to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very

sorious; I becamo more sorlous myself and told him that just so

he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the propor Embassy

department stating for the sake of the record that subject had

told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy roception, but

wished the U.S. Embassy to know he has doing. It sololy out of

curlosity and was in no way th sympathy with the Soviet Union.

Subject

seemed greatly relleved and thanked me very much.

.1zo solzing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given subject the

Invitation, I asked 1f Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject

replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYEV was

now studying English at

, the Institute.Subject added, on his

own initiative, that he had also boon to GAZIYEY's apartment

twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said

that the first time he went to GAZIEVis was shortly before he

(Subject) got married (Subject me vag marrled about mid-ipril

1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he

and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'.. Subject finished

eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had

his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,

but docided to walt and have a second go at him alone another

time.

13.

My wito and I ontortnined subjoct and his wifo at our

home on 27 November, but the eventig was not mennt to and did

not afford an opportunity to discus the Soviets any further:

Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the

7 November Sovlet recoption afterall, because, despito by

assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he

folt It. was simply safer to stay away foom the Soviet Embassy

altogether.

At. my suggestion we agreed to got-togother for

luch somotimo in the near future.

14. for vartous reasons, including the poor state of

Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did

not got together for the lunch until 7 March.. This time, I

played it straight with Subject; told him that I was interested

In anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet

he had met, and questloned him closely regarding the details.

Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered

my questions to

the best of his abllity. It seemed to me, and

still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject

had not told me on ll July what he subsequently told me on

I November (1.ee, that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and

on one occasion had met another Soviet there). This was that

he folt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting

the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too

hard (which I didn't on'll July), he felt more comfortable

Ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits

and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was

genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.

Embassy over attenline the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to

Impress no with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and

folt obliged to complotely clear the rocord by montioning the

visits to GiZIYi's home and meeting the other soviet there.

15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his

apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) wint to

Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place

about mid-March 1967 Subjoct said he had expected to find

only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third

person was there when Subject arrived. _ Subject said. GAZIYEV.

introduced the third person as Valentin "something " When I

asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subjoct immediatoly reacted

and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description

of the Soviet also fIt LOGINOV. CAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was

with the Embassy (Subject coulda't remember in what capacity) and

described LOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening

started off very casually, with LOCINOV expressing interest.

In the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.

LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most

of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get

a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asted Subject 1f

he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to.

start with, ote.

Subjuct replied that he'd be happy to, although

It didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in

spanish.

LOGINOY simply laughed this off, and It was agreed

LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.

evening, then bogan to ask subjoct questiong which loft subjoct

with. "no doubt" that he (LOGINOY) was trying to feel subject out

oss his political irons. Subjucò said tial no conidn't rémember

most.of LOGINOV! s questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV.

began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't

find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish

than other nationalitien. He also made varlous derogatory

remarks about the extent of American Influence in Mexico. Subject

said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOVes purpose became so

blatantly obvious; that ho (subject) stopped the conversation

and told LOGINOY that bofore they went any farther, he thought

LOGINOV should know that he was talking to somone who was

"100i capitalist, " completely pro-American, and had absolutely

no sympathy with communist. lihile this pounds awfully blunt

and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good

In my oyes, the fact of the matter Is that subject does tend to.

be dst a bit blunt at times, and khowing his Ideological leanings,

I rould not put it past him to have sald exactly this.) Subject

said that LOCINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the

conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject

connented that he had a pretty good idea of what thé Soviets were

up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subjoct

related the story he

once told me about having been in Veracrus

a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put

under arrest there•

Subject told LOGINOV that feveryone knew

the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda."

•16. After about

tventy minutes, according to subject, politica

were dropped and the conversation turned to nore innocuous topies.

Subject said that LOGINOY socmod somewhat. Irritatod with him, but

on the wole kept his composuro very woll and treated Jubject

politaly for the two hourd or loss subjoct remiined. no Subjoct

was leaving, LOGINOV again said ho'd come by tho Inatitute to

of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by

-17

Subject

said that GizIrev loft most of the politically

related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred

to the evening again. Howover, a fow woeks after Subject

roturnod to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEY had Subjoct and his

wito over to dinnor (this would place the second dinner in

about mid-Mar) ..

This time GAZITEV and his wife vore the only

others present, and the ovening

passed ilthout any reference

to politics.

Subject shated that he still occasionally goes

across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEy betweem

evening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been

to GAZIYEY's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his

home •

18.

Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose

In meeting him was to assosa his exploitability, he did not seem

to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for

LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I

spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV

swas an exceptionally capable Soviet Intelligence officer. I

also explained. that lt was very possible GAZIYEV was using the

Institute: to spot other candidates for interviews with

intelligence officers, and questioned subjoct about GAzIlEVis

activitlos and contacts at the Institute. However, Subject said

that as far as ho could toll GAZITEY probly much stuck to himself

at the Institute and did.

not have any particudar friande there

whom subject know about.

subjoct suld he would keep his eyes

open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and rould.

let me know if he came onto anything interosting. Subject also

offered to. "play up tor GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance

If I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions

of appreciation.

19. The question that remins unansvered after all this 1o,

of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV wore talking about subject

over the phone on 24 April 196% According to. Subject, the

dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, whtle

LOCT NOV did not

attend GAZlYEVis second dinner, which took

place about mid-May: Since I am satlafled Subject told me the

truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV

told GAZIYEV on le April ho wishod to discuss with GAZIYEV

concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV

Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on

24 April, It would appear that it was finally decided that

GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife

over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase.

the memory of the first dinner.

but that this

ROWTON then telephoned FRADIER's office (in

time managed to reach FRADIER himself:

told

RONTON that he had the moncy and could

pass it to RONTON that same afternoon if he

felt it necessary.

RONTOS replied that he

preferred to pick it up as soon as convenient

for FRADYER and made a date for 1630 in the

corridor outside the Koala Restaurant,

three or four minutes by: foot from Sanborns:

RONTON spoke with FRADIER for about two

minutes in the corridor after receiving the

envelope containing the money.

In reply to

FRADYER's queries,

RONTON stated that LIRALN-1

was somewhat disappointed that he could not

provide him with some sort of written contract

for. LIRELIC-1 and also because of the delay in

reimbursing him for operational expenses (some

-of which had been disallowed).

ROWTON then

revealed to FRADYER that LIREALN-1 was waiting

for him at the Sanborns bar so that he could

pass him the money without further delay.

FRADYER then regretted that he had been unable

to see LIREALN-1 personallj to explain the

disallowance of some of the expenses.

suggested that FRADYER might take thịs

opportunity to say a few words to LIREALN-1,

especially since the latter. knew that FONTON

and FRADYER were meeting at that moment

somewhere nearby.

FRADYER agreed but said

that he preferred the gift section of Sanborns

to the bar.

then proceeded alone to the downstairs

bar of Sanborhs

and 'found LIREALN-l waiting.

ROWTON explained

that he was late because of

a last-rinute arrangement with FRADYER for a

LIREALN-1

then paid the bill and accompanied ROWTOY up

the stairs in the rear to the

gift section,

where they found FRADYER looking over the

silver display in the shop.

An apparently casual conversation then took

place, with FRADYER and LIREALN-1 doing most

of the talking and with RONTOY occasionally

examining the silverware on display.

When the conversation cuded, Rowrov land

LIKEALN-1 moved

to the men's room, where

LIRENLJ-1 was ablo to chock the amount of

moncy. for him and sign the enclosed receipt.

It will bo noted from

the above that the ROWTON/

LIRFALN-1 meeting with FRADYER Was

not planned in advance.

(as pointed out in refcrence A), but was a hasty recommendation

made to FRADYER by ROWTON. and an equally lasty decision taken

the spot.

ROWTON and LIREAIN-1 had met previously

only in ROWTON's home,

excopt on two occasions when ROWTON

picked up LIRALN-1 in his car in tho Ciudad Deportes (near

the main Mexico City bull ring) beticon rogular meotings to.

pass him funds.

ROWTON. hnd never met with LIREALM-l at

Sanboins or in any other public place prior to this. meeting.

LIREALM-I also ampliflod his written report sub-

sequently in one significant dotall.

In rcference to the

remark of LoGIlor to the offoct that he had seen him with his

boss at Sanborns two Wednesdays previously when "you had a

drink in the bar and then talked to your boss,'

LIREALN-1 told

ROWTON on reflection that LOGINOV had also stated that "you

were having a drink at the bar and a man came up to you and

brought you to your -boss."

This indicates

that FRADYER WaS

meant as the person described as LIKEALN-l's boss.

With regard to where and how often ROWTON and

LIREALN-1 have hid operational nootings in the past,

requested in paragraph 3 of jeference B, Station files show

that between 20 October 1967 and 16 January 1968 ROWTON met

with LIREALM-l at his home ten tines.: Besides these meetings

with LIREALN-1

at his home, ROwTON recalls only two other noctings

with -LIREALM-1, when ho picked up LIREALN-I' in his car for brief

meetings to pass him funds.

Since the LOGINOV/LIREALN-1

The only telephone contact that has existed between them has

LIREALN-I's contact reports

one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at

which very few words were exchanged.

It is significant to note,

that at the 12 November 1967 meeting, while LIREAL 1

and LOGINOV were chatting in the showers

after the match,

his continuing contacls with LOGIYOY were at the latter's

initiative and that LIRALant nould not nake

any attenpe to

follow un or show'any unusual interost.

LIKENLN-1 did not

report scoing LOGINOV again until 13 Janua's 1968 (two

months

lato'), this timo, as usual; on the teunis court.

Icadgun'ters will recall that the LIkENLN-I relation

with tho Soviets

dates back many months prior to the

date ROWTON took over his handling.

The file reveals that

LIREALN-I first mot LOGINOY Ou 22 April 1967, and that at.

that timo, LOGINOV proposed to LIRFALN-1 that

they meet

regularly, evory wednesday, for tennis and occasionally take

This leaves no

doubt that the

paco was set by LOGINOV himself since he undoubtedly saw

in

LIREALN-1 a potential target.

The situation was further

complicated by the character and modus operandi of LOGINOV,.

as woll is the limitations of LIRELN-l's cover situation at

the time...

A principal dilemma facing tho Case Officer with

rogard to LIREALM-I's exposure to the Soviets has been his

regular attendance at the French Club. Since the French

has boon ond of the main ones left to LIREALN-1 after the

olimination of the soviet,

Indonesian, and VAR operations, it

was considored necessaty for LIREALN-1 to continue his normal

contacts with the French.

He could have dropped his menbership

in the club to avoid further involvement with the Soviets,

but this would lave broken a long-established pattern and

deprived him of his principal access at that time.

It was

therefore ruled out as counterproductive:

• Subsequent developments appear to confiim the

Station's view

that LOGINOV based his provocative remark on

a hunch or, at most,

on a strong suspicion concerning

LIREALN-1•

As-mentioned in paragraph 1 of reforence B, such

prolonged social contact between an Amorican and a Soviet

"is almost inevitably

construed ou both sides to have intel-

ligence.connotations.". The Station wishes to emphasize,

whatever suspicions were arousod in the mind

of LOGINOV concerning LIREAL I were already generated months

before he joined the PBRUNEY Section in late October 1967.

10:

In conclusion,

the Station feels that nothing has

been

noted in the subsequent operational activity of FRADYER

or ROWTON to indicate that either of them has been identified

as an intelligence

operative. ROWTON has had no contact of any

kind with Soviets in this area, nor has he detected any

surveillance, either physical or technical, of his person

or home.

Both he and FRADYER, however, will continue to

maintain maximum

security to avoid any

further exposure to

such persons as LOGINOV:

LIREALN-1, on his part, has been

able to improve his covér by opening an office and making his

overt activity as plausibly commercinl as possible.

Tho following is a verbatin extract of the report

I had Joined Val and my wife on her

He apologized

for interrupting our game and suggested we go back

to playing and he would watch us.

We had made. a

date for tennis Wednesday.

He would call me if his

leg still bothered him or for my other reason he

was unable to play. Now he said he wanted to study

my game so that he

beat me ll'ednesday:

walked with me as far as the net where he stopped

me and the following conversation took place.

"I saw you talking with your boss the other

day," Val said with a slight grin. "r

"My boss?" I asked. I suspected nothing and

seriously considered the question:

search back in my mind if my cover boss had ever

met Val.

I recalled that i had once pointed Val

out to him..

The conversation proceeded too rapidly,

for me to answer my own question.

The fact is

At Sanborns two Wednesdays

"Two Wednesdays ago...

At Sanborn's?

You're mistaken.

My boss left about six weeks ago--

mado his prosence at Sanborns at the time of the moting

between LIREALM-l; ROTON; and the undersignod impossible;

as it would have given him about 10 minutes

to leave the site

of the mooting, got into lils. car, and drive to the soviet

an impossible feat even

in light traffic. It is

Embas® thon that LOGINOV was not present at the time of the

möeting but was told that LIRbAL-I met with two. Americans.Y.i

Itwas-and still is the undorsigned's conviction that whoever

saw LIREALN-1 was unable, to positively identify ROWTON or

tho undorsigned.

The undersigned reasons that had LOGINOV.

known that ho, the undersigned, had talked to LIREALN-1,

LOGINOV would

have montioned his name after. falling.to

obtain

any reaction

from LIREALN-l from mentioning the

latter'& "boss!""

The undersigned believes that LOGINOV, who

18 not completely stupid,

would have either said nothing or

would have gone all the way in his statements to LIREALN-1

had he known the undersigned's name.

By the same token 1t

appears that LOGINOV failed to identify ROWTON... The

undorsigned had only met with one other Soviet besides

LOGINOV: at the time of the meeting, and that only once; and

that Soviot was no longer in Mexico City when the meeting

wIth LIREALM-I took place. RONTON has never had any contact,

social or otherwise,.!

with any of the Soviets.

S.o..

The undersigned is the first to recognize that meeting

with LIREALM-l at the Sanborns silver shop vas a thoroughly

unwise move: He wishes

to emphasize that this was the only

meoting at the time that he had held with LIRALN-l outside

of a safehouse. ' All

meetings between the undersigned and

LIREALM-I have

since been held under the most secure con

ditions on the edge of the Federal District and, in one case,

beyond.

while this does not make this decision

any wiser, he

also wants to emphasize the fact that' it was made on the spur

of the moment, to quote the old cliche, because the undersigned

"felt sorry" for LIREALM-I because of

the latter's financial

difficulties with the Station over his last accounting.

The

undersigned unwisely put LIREALN-l's morale for a brief moment

over basic security considerations.

He is not in the habit

of doing this

as a matter of course.

The day before his nest

scheduled tennis meeting with LIREALN-1 the following Wednesday,

LOGINOV called LIREALN-1 and asked to be excused as his leg

had worsoned.

The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his

regular

tennis game with LIREALN-1 but made no mention of

his previous

conversation with him two weeks before.

The

undersigned waited to complete a review of this case until

he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association

functions.

Because of the visits of Soviet athletes

and

artists which kept LOGINOV busy, however,

this meeting did not

materialize until 28 March.

Although the undersigned and

LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for more

than two hours

on this occasion during a visit to the local Home Fair, LOGINOV

never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting.

He has

never brought LIREALN-l's name to the attention of the

undersigned.

The telliug took only 10 minutes.

I had

considerable difficulty in taking her through a chronological account

and holding her to one subject.

It became obvious that she le a

The following

On parting he said he would call her botore she leit

He called a day or so later and cane over at ca 10:00

He

asked when she-sould be back and how could he contact hor in the

United States.: She gave hin her mailing address and promised to

He again asked. bor to find him au English teacher.

She asked him,

if he evor thought of going to the United States.

Smiling, be answered,

"Yes, who doesn't dream of going.": He added

that he can't so anywhere until he learis the language.

She asked,

he would like to make a change.

He answerod that he has to be

GEURET

(Commont:

Mexicans still commonly beliove that the Mexican - North

American Cultural Institute 1s part of the Inbassy)

Subject went to the

Therefore

Embassy on the

morning of 16.

Decenber and

was

referred to a Mexicau girl on the second floor (USIS). Subject told

this girl her story and recolved the names of several toachors it

the Institute.

As she,

was leaving she

thought that

the Embassy

would be interested in her story and thus fell into the hands of the

political officor

She then went back to:the Soviet Embassy but

LOGINOV was not in so she left the list of teachers with the guard for

him. She left Mexico the next day, 17 December.

4..

LILYRIC photo covorngo shows that Subject was at the Soviet

Embassy from 13:35 to 13:42 on 16 Novemver (after leaving tho American

Embasay).

She srrivod and departed in a taxi. LILMIC also reports.

that LOCINOV was

out from 13:14 to 13:52 on that date which contiis

Subject's statemont that ho was not there.

LILYRIC photo covorage

also shows

that subject viaited the Sovlet Embassy from 11:20 to

11:54 on

10 November 1967,

arriving and departing by taxi, hor first

visit to the Embasay).

Again, LILYRiC has LOGINOY in the

Embassy

from 09:07 to 13:45 on that date, thus conflining that Subject

actually did

see, hin.

Thus her first meeting with LOGINOV at the

party was probably on 6 or 8 November 1967.

On'T November LOGINOV

was at the reception in tho Embassy:

LIENVOY has no information on

& social ongagement for LOGINOV at this. time.

5.

From her account it was obvious that she was extromoly

Impressed with LOGINOV both physically ("he is such a handsome

man"')

ard as a person.

From her conversations she concluded that he liked

Americans and was interestod in meating them, that he is really

interested in learning English so that be can go to the United Statea

and that, sonchow, he didn't want his own people to know about these

interests and intentions.

In fact, LOGINOV,

"did a fine job in de

briefing her and in keeping the contact open.

This type of activity

has become standard for him In Mexico.

B.. Although the subject of his marital status never came up.

Subject assumes that LOGINOV is single.

"Te acts like a single man".

He loves parties and dancing and sporta. (Again, standard behavior

for him.)

several times that she would cooperate completely:

She is clearly not

At the conclusion of the interview, subject sas told

According to LIROCKEl-l, there is a

keyhole on the inside of the gate, but there definitely is no keyhole

on the outside. LIROCKET-l has never seen anyone opch the gate

with a key.

LIROCKET-I has been present in only

about, five instances

when

non-Soviets in vehicles have sought admittance through the

vehicle gate, which is adjacent to the foot gate.

In cach of 'the

five instances, the callers have been delivery men whose trucks

have apparently been recognized by the guard. In cach instance,:

the truck has pulled up with its. nose to

the vehicle gate and. the

guard has walked to the gate and opened it manually. .The vehicle

gate consists of two doois which open inward.

It is secured by

one dead bolt: frón one door to the other.: LIROCKET-1 has never

noticed a padlock. on the gate.. After being admitted to the

Embassy

grounds, the trucks in each

case have driven únaccompanied to and

parked under the portecochere on the north. side of the main Embassy

building. After closing the gate, the guard has returned to the

Gatehouse,

where - although LIROCKET-l has never actually

observed

a guard doing so

inside the

he could

and 28 Soptömber 1966. On 20 September, the Station learned from

hn: boen invited along with sovernl other

Merican traves agents to attend an Intourist conference li Moscow

from 24-29 October

A meetine was consequently arranged with Subject

for 28 Septenber through the INPURE officer:

stated that he was not intorested in working for the Station on a

Ho was willing to help to the extent he was, he

explained,

bocause he belloved basically what we did about current

Subject was thoroughly dobrieled upon his return fron the

USSR In early November 1966, at which

time he continued to exhibit

the sano Iriendlinoss and cooperativeness noted in paragraph live.

Be reported that he was

avare o1 no ellort to assess, cultivate, or

compromise biu in the USSR.

He provided inforeation

both on the

formal proceedings of the conference and on individual Sovlet and

foreign particlarite,

= Feis as ou a Spanish businesssan he not in

Moscow.

This infornation resulted in three Fleld Information Reporta

(DN-10,870, 30 November 1966,

HMH-10,871, 30 Noverber 1906, HA-

10,875, 30 November 1966), one dispatch to hadrid

(HMMA -30725,

I December 1966),.

and a second to Santlago' (H4WA-30749, 2 December

1966). Since furnishing Informtion on his trip to the USSR,

Subject has provided information on the travel

of the Bolshol

Baliot in Mexico, on a Mexican traveler to the USSR, and

on a

Sovlot student group which wis slated to visit Mexico, but which

for unknown reusons fafled to arrive at the last minute.

The only Soviet

Subject his recently been in contact with

1$ LOGINOV, whon be occasionally sees on visa mtters.

According to

Subject, thoir relntionship during-the past year- has been strictly of

• businoss' nature and LOGINOV has show no interest In extending it

beyond this.

Subject consequently appears to have little to offer

in the way of an access agent to the Soviets in the foreséeable

future.. However, as the manager of one of fivo Mexican travel

agencles reprosonting Intourist and because of his apparently

excellent contacts with key personnel of the other four travel agencies,

he promises to be a useful roferent on persons who book travel in.

Mexico to the Soviet Union and other Communist countries.•

Despite the regularization of our relatlonship with subject

and his increased cooperativeness, we do not feel ve are currently

in a position to bak bin to undergo an SGSWIRL intervlew.:

The

relationship botween the case officer and Subject at this time 1e

essentally one of equals in which Subject is voluntarily assisting

LNFORT out of ideological motivation..

It is true that his atrong

business interest in maintaining friendly relations with LNFORT

and INPURE provides us with a degree of control, but we feel

that at

present it is better loft as a form of tacit control than brandished

even subtly. It is our opinion that Subjoct would regard an SCSWIRL

intervlew as an effort both to licrease our control over bim and to

draw him dooper into the Intelligence business.

Such a reaction

would in all probability undo much of our recent progress ulth

Subject. Consequently, we would prefer to postpone an SGSWIRL

intervlew until other

ve further solidily our relationship with

Subject or we

wish to use him in more sensitive vork.
