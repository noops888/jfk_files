Regarding telegram alledged sent to Cuba in 1962.

I checked with post-office here and learned that there are

six Cubas in the U.S. and now I'm sure that the telegram

in question was sent to a Cuba here in the U.S. and not to

Havana Cuba or any other place in Cuba.

I therefore must go on record as stating that at no.

time did I ever send a telegram to Havana Cuba or any place

in Cuba.

There is a Cuba in each

Suhscribson were identified and in sore instances the cocupation and/or tire

of business vas deternined.

Tax raturns of seventy-five of the one hundred and tuenty lichigan persons

called wore checked. Corporate returns wore not included. Thay failed to

disclose

any parsonal trangactions with Earl Ruby. However, some of the

returns disclosed deductions for interest payments to d. L. Hudson Company

on charge accounts. some showed enployment by Hudson's; by Farl Ruby and

George Marcus, d/is/a Cobo Clenners; or by firns handling cleaners supplies

or ciuipment.

The balance primarily disclosed various professional or

stilled oscurations.

Internal Ravenue Agent R. Anstett determined that Coco Closners has an ex-

clusive. contract with j..

L. Rudson Conpany. Datroit, Hichigan,

to furnish

custon cloaning services for thair custonars. "Hudson's, being ona of the

largest department stores in the midwest, furnishes this sorvice to nearly

all of the areas called by Cobo Cleaners.

In vier of the Cobo - Hudson business relationship, coupled with the infor-

nation reported on the availabla tax returns, it appears that the Michigan

calls originating froz. Cobo Cleaners ware in connaction with that business.

In my last report, dated Decenber il, 1963, I indieated that I would attempt

to determine the following individuals background and/or relationship with

Earl Puby:

with the exception of checking the tax filing record of dacar A. Ruby in

the Detroit district where no record sins disclosed, I mode no request for

arj collateral Investigations in this matter.

It is my understanding, that

I am nut to initiate any third party Inquirles rolutive to this cose.

The November 1963 billing, from Cobo Cleaners (UM,3-0400), discloses that

four telephone calls were nade to Dallas, Texas.

The calls originated in

Chicago and were charged to the Cobo Claaners rumbai.

On

1964, no attempt was made by Agant instett to question Earl

Ruby about the Havana

telegran or the various lung distance calls in 1962

and 1983. First, because his audit concorns only the years 1951 and 1962;

and secondly, any questions on this line nay have disrupted the cooparative

attitude ard caused an unecessary delay.

However, on January E, 1964, an opportunity grose for Agent instett to question

Earl Ruby about certain partnership deductions, which had the appearance of

possibla personal expenses.

long distance toll chagges in 1982. Concerning these, tresparpayer

did it have sufficient leeway

2: Prior to the shooting of

Oswald, Jack Ruby had sent

a money order from the western

consider the possibility that

Jack Ruby had utilized the

Q: (To the extent applicable)

Did the special unit assume that

for Jack

Ruby to have had

assistance in gaining access

to the basement, someone would

have had to have told him

the exact timing of the transfer,

so that he could send the

into the basement in time to

2: (To the extent applicable)

Did the special unit consider

the possibility that Jack Ruby

received word of the general

timing of the transfer and had

devised a scheme whereby

his arrival at the basement

would result in

a

message being

sent upstairs to begin the

transfer?

(Focus here is on whether the

possibility that Ruby's arrival

was the trigger for the transfer

rather than that he only could

Name Joe: R. Cody

Address 1113 Cedar Ridge

Date July 11, 1978 Time 3:30 e

Place Dallas Police Headquarte

DeSoto, Texas

Interview: Detective Cody was interviewed in his office (Room

212) at Police Headquarters. He was questioned relative to

his friendship with Jack Ruby and he stated. that he first met

Ruby in 1951 while a patrolman working on South Ervay Street

in downtown Dallas.. Ruby was the owner of the Silver Spur

and there were numerous altercations on the premises which

called for police action of some type, and during this time

Cody became friendly with Ruby. Cody left the Police Depart-

ment and entered the U.S. Army,

serving in Korea and is South

Texas and Mexico, in Army Intelligence. He returned to the

D.P.D. in 1954 and was assigned to the Detective Division, Nar-

cotics squad. Ruby was very cooperative with the squad, giving

information that resulted in arrests. He continued the friend-

ship with Ruby through the years and used to go ice-skating

with him. He used to play hockey too and ruby was a hocky fan.

Ruby mentioned that he was having trouble with the

Union (AGVA), but he didn't elaborate. Detective Cody stated

that during this period of time he was sure that ruby did not

have any organized crine

connections

years that he knew Jack, he had had some hard times. The

club (Silver Slipper) was doing badly and Ruby slept in the

back and cooked there too.

On the day of the assassination (11-22-63) Cody stated

that he was off work, but when he heard about it an the radio

he called in and was directed to the I.S.B.D., and arrived

there about ten or fifteen minutes later, and was present down-

stairs when the rifle was found. He later went to Police Head-

quarters and was there when LHO was brought in for killing

Police Officer Tippett. The officers were bringing him down

the hall (third floor) when he asked LHO his name. When LaO

gave him his name and where he worked, he grabbed him and took

him into Captain Fritz's office and told him that he was

from the TSBD and the one wanted in connection with President

Kennedy's death.

Questioned relative to Ruby's presence on the third

floor, Cody stated that he didn't see ruby on the third floor

at any time, that he (Cody) was there, but that evening at

the first show-up, which was in reality a press conference,

he was one of the police Officers who brought IHo down to the

basement. When he looked around, Jack Ruby was standing on a

table. Cody asked him what he was doing there and ruby replied

that he was covering the event for the Jewish

Press.

All

during the press conference, Lao was denying that he shot any-

one. After 11:00 p.m. that night,. Detective Cody stated that

NW 55923 DocId: 32267370 Page 42

he was off duty and had flown his plane to Amarillo, Texas

for a scuba-diving contest: that Sunday (11-24-78) when he

heard on the radio that Jack Ruby had shot LHO. A short time

after Ruby was incarcerated at the Dallas County Jail, Cody

stated that he went to visit Jack and asked him, "why did you

do it, Jack?" He said Ruby replied, "I did it for you guys.

He was a punk (LHO) and wouldn't have served any time in jail

for it."

Questioned further relative to information received

from Ruby, Detective Cody did elaborate on several cases where.

he was called at Headquarters and given information by Ruby,

and he acted on this information, which resulted in arrests.

Ruby was not registered with the D.P.D. as an informant as

far as Detective Cody knew. He just passed information (of a

criminal naturel to members of the DeD that he knew.

Investigation of the Operational Security

Involving the Iransfer of Lee Harvey Oswald

on November 24, 1963-

Sir:

Tha investigative team which you appointed on November 29, 1963,

to make this investigation wishes to submit the tollowing report:

Security was set up in the basement parking area of the City Hall

at zoproximately 9 a.l. on Sunday, November 24, 1963- (See

attachments)

The basement was searched and guards placed at all entrances.

All unauthorized personnal were removed from the araz. Security

personnel and news media were then allowed to enter tha basement.

An armored truck was ordered and arrived at the Cormerce Street

ramp at approximately 11:00 a.n. It was backed onto the ramp.

The truck did not have sufficient clearance ta be taken to the

bottom of the ramp.

The driver believed the truck might stall

due to the weight if it was placed on the incline. It was then

decided to leava the truck at the top of the Cormerce Streët

ramp with the rear sheels on the Incline and the front wheels

on the sidewalk of the Commarca Street side of the City Hall.

The Jail Office corridor outside the Jail Office and the ramp

area South of the Southeast comer of the Jail Office was

cleared of everyone except security officers.

Plans wera charged and Lieutenant R. S. Pierce drove a squad

car out of the basement area and out the Main Streat ramp. He

was accompanied by Sergeants J. A. Putnam and B. J. Maxey. They

nade a left turn on Main Street, a left tum on Harrood Street

Detective C. N. Dhority was in the process of backing the car he

was driving Into position adjacent to the Jail Office entrance,

when the prisoner was brought out of the Jail Office by Detectives

J. Ro Leavelle and L. C. Graves, preceded by Captain J. W. Fritz

and Lieutenant R. E. Swain. They were followed by Detective I, Do

Montgonery. The

prisoner had taken a few steps toward the car.

Jack Ruby apparently was standing about 10 or 12 feet from the

Southeast corner of the Jail Office, at the bottom of the Main

Street Pary near the pipe railing

Ruby lunged forward from a

position between acting Detective W. J. Harrison and Robert S.

Huffaker, Jr., a newsman for KRID-IV. Ruby approached Lee Harvey

Oswald with a ravolver extended and fired one shot into Oswald

below the rio cage on the left side.

The shot was fired at ayproximately 11:20 all. Ruby was innedi-

ately arrested. Lee Harvey Oswald expired at Parkland Hospital

at 1:07 p.II.

This grous interrogated 123 persons during the course of this

investigation.

This included 20 patrolmen, 21 reserves, 30

detectives, 19 supervisors, I3 reporters,

le camoramen and,

civilians.

Most of the officers were assigned to provide

security and the reporters and cameramen were in the basement

at the time of the transfer.

Only one of the civilians inter

rogated was in the basement at the time and this was Jack Ruby.

ment that we have rot been able to interview. We were able to

deterina there were approximately 10 members of the news madia

in the basement whose identity we have not been able to deter

mine. It is believed these are newspaper corraspondents repre

senting publications from other areas of the country and even

other countries.

Tire and money made the running down of these

people inadvisable at this tina, particularly since it is not ben

lieved that any of them could throw additional light on this matter..

Numerous side investigations which grew out of this Investigation

were also tide. a separate report covering these incidents will

be subnitted.

reasorable certainty that Jack Loon Huby entered the basement

him and any police officer or member of the press; that his

entrance into the basement at this particular time was the

result of a series of unfortunate coincidences which caused

a momentary breakdown in the security measures adopted.

We

are also convinced that Ruby was in the basement for a

naxinun of 2 minutes with a strong possibility that it was

only 5 to 10 seconds prior to the shooting of Lee Harvey

Oswald.

The following evidence led us to the above conclusion:

but a little girl who works for me had called and

asked that I send her some money to Ft. Worth.

I had left my apartment, gone to Western Union

at liain and the Expressway, and wired her $25.00.

I laft there and noticed the croid around the

City Hall.

I walked up that way, thinking I

night get a chance to see Oswald. As I reached

the ramp that leads to the basement, I noticed

San Pierce pull up fron the ramp in a black car.

replied, "Somebody had to do it, Ya'll

that he got down there at the actual time Oswald

was brought down."

To Sergeant P. T. Dean (Attachment 27) =

"After Mr. Sorrells interrogated the subject I

questioned Ruby as to how he had entered the

basenent and the length of time he had been

there. Ruby then stated to me in the presence

of Mr. Sorrells that he had entered the base-

ment through the ramp entering on lain Street.

He further stated that he would estimate his

total time as about 3 minutes before the

detectives brought Oswald into his view, then

he imnediately shot him (Oswald)."

To Detective T. D. McMillon (Attachment. 74).

"e talked to him when we got to the fifth

floor. On the fifth floor Ruby was asked how

he got to the basement. He replied that he

came from the Western Union Office where he

wired a girl in Ft. Wo-th some money. He said

he sar Rio Pierce drive out of the basement.

He walked past the policeman standing there.

He said a policeman hollered at him, but he

ducked his head and kept going.

He said that

he knew he could always act like a reporter.

He also said, "Ya'll wont believe this, but 1

there, Oswald was coming out."

XVIII. Conclusion:

Ao

This investigative team believes that Jack Ruby

entered the Main Street ramp as the car driven by

Lieutenant Rio Pierce was leaving the basement,

Patrolman R. E. Vaughn was the only officer

guarding the lain Street ramp at this time, and he

had stepped into Main Street to halt traffic in

order that Lieutenant Pierce could make a left

tum onto Hain Street.

Bo We also feel it should be noted that no officer

interviewed knew the time that Oswald was to be

brought to the basement. The car that was to be

used for the transfer has still in process of

backing into position when Cswald was led from

the Jail Office (Attachments 37 and 77)

C.

The still pictures (Attachments 6-A and 53-1)

the right front door opened on to the sidewalk area. He was

listening to the Police Department radio

He was still there when the obvious commotion told

him something was amiss in the basement.

in the downtown section on this Sunday morning and he knows beyond

any doubt in his mind, that Jack ruby, whom he had known many years

did not walk down Main Street anywhere near that ramp.

Asked why he hasn't mentioned this before, he ad-

vised he did as soon as he found out what had happened. He im-

mediately notified his superior, It. Knox. He didn't hear any

more about it until yesterday talking with vaughn who asked him

to mention it to me.

Captain Jack. Revill was present during this interview.

I accompanied the Captain and Vaughn to the basement

of this building where the LHO/Ruby scene is located and we

examined the scene carefully.

Close inspection reveals an alley separating the

Police Headquarters building and the next building and the ad-

joining building which ends the block. This last of third bullding

also houses (and did in 1963) the Western Union office used by

Ruby that Sunday morning. It is quite plausible that ruoy - or

anyone else - could walk from the corner building (western Union)

past the second building, turn left into the alley alongside the

Police Headquarters and enter the Dallas Police Department by

way of a side door, which leads to a stairway directly to the base-

ment area where the shooting took place.

While this possibility doesn't alter any facts, it's

an alternate route which could have been utilized by Ruby. and

would have made a much less conspicuous entry possible.

Interview: Captain Jack Revill was interviewed this date in

his office at Police Headquarters. Captain Revill is in charge

of the of the Internal Affairs Division of the Dallas Police

Department. In 1963 he was a lieutenant and was

assigned to

the Criminal Intelligence Section of the Special Service Bureau

under Captain Gannaway. On November 24, 1963 he was off duty

when Ruby shot oswald but he was later assigned as part of the

team that investigated the killing of Oswald and how Ruby had

gained entrance into the basement. He questioned Roy Vaughn

who was assigned to the ramp entrance and Blackie Harrison.

Both men took polygraph tests and passed. He. comments on Napolian

Daniels, who also took a polygraph but failed it. He believed

Roy Vaughn, who stated he didn't see Ruby enter the basement.

The possibility of Ruby having used the alley entrance to the

building was raised. Captain Revill stated

that he had covered

the ground with Jack Moriarty, and it is possible that Ruby

could have entered through the alleyway door. He further stated

that the door should have been locked but he wasn't aware if

it was or not. But the timing of the walk from the western

the same. He also mentioned that a friend of Vaughn's,

a Sergeant Flusche, was on Main Street observing the area

and that he knew Jack Ruby and did not see Ruby enter the

basement via the ramp.

Captain Revill was questioned about JURE and at first

he could not recall the name. However, when Sylvia odio's

name was mentioned, he recalled that at the time (1963) he

was getting information relative to Cuban activities in Dal-

las

from Nestor Castellanos, who was employed at the Hilton

Hotel. The names of the JURE members were read to Captain

Revill

and he didn't recall having heard of them, but referred

me to Captain Tomlinson, the present head of the Dallas Po-

lice Department Intelligence Unit. He said that the files

from 1963 may have

been purged.

Questioned about Reverend Roy. Rushing, Captain Revill

recalled

his name immediately but wasn't too familiar with

what was said in 1963 to the Warren Commission about Reverend

Rushing.

Revill was given a xeroxed copy of his statement, read

it and stated that

to the best of his recollection, the in-

formation is the same. He then gave me a business card which

was

given to him a couple of months ago by Reverend Rushing.

Captain Revill believes that Reverend Rushing is a con man.

Interview: ME. Gannaway was interviewed by Staff Investigator

Joseph J. Basteri in his office at 411 West 13th Street, Austin,

Texas.

Mr. Gannaway is presently employed by the State of

Texas as the Planning Commissioner for their Criminal Justice

System.

He has been employed in this capacity since his retire-

ment from the Dallas Police. Department on July 1, 1971. He en-

tered the department on June 10, 1937 as a police officer and

rose to the rank of Captain.

Gannaway very willingly discussed the conditions that

existed in Dallas during the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. He

stated that in the early 40's a group from Chicago attempted to

penetrate the criminal scene in Dallas but they failed. Of this

group, he could only recall the names of Paul Labriolla, Mark

Lipsky, Marty ochs and weinberg. This group, according to

MI.

Gannaway, were big time hoods with good connections. In short

time the District Attorney's office and the police department

began to arrest many of them. Sheriff Decker had rounded up a

group and drove them to the edge of town with instructions for

them not to return. These criminals soon got the message

and they all fled Dallas.

About the time that this group at-

tempted to move into Dallas, Herbert Nolan was killed by a

planted bomb and Benny Binion fled Dallas. MI. Gannaway re-

marked that rumors around town were that Binion had put out

the contract and then fled. Mr. Gannaway stated that this was

not so, the reason Binion left Dallas was that this mob moved

In and Binion did not wish to oppose them. Although Ruby was:

in Dallas during this period, he was in no way attached to

this group. In fact, Gannaway stated that they would not even

speak to him.

After this group was chased out of Dallas, Paul Roland

Jones entered änd amateurly attempted to bribe Sheriff Guthrie

GANGWAY

in a vain effort to take over Dallas. Sawyer said that Jones

was in no way connected with this former group and definitely dia

not put Jones in the same league. He classified Paul Roland

Jones and his associates as small time opportunists that had

no mob connections:

Gannaway stated that he could speak very knowledgeably

of events during this period as he was, as the Captain, in charge

of the Special Service Bureau which included the Vice Squad,

Narcotics Bureau, and the Intelligence, which supervised the

subversive

and radical groups. Gannaway stated that although

Dallas was a clean city he did not wish to imoly that dallas

was completely free of any criminal activity. Gannaway explained

NW 55923 DocId: 32267370 Page 65

---

## Page 66

Interview with w. P. Gannaway

Page 3.

that Dallas did have its share of gambling and bookmaking

action, and as such there had to be some sort of organiza-

tion. This organization was in no way similar to the family

type organization that exists in the east. In bookmaking, ex-

plained Gannaway, there would have to be some

sort of national

syndicate influence to set the morning line and the spread

on any sports action. This was controlled by their own home-

grown criminals. Gannaway attributed the control of this gam-

bling operation to Joe Civello. Gannaway emphasized that there

was no question that Civello was the Don in Dallas as these

gamblers all bowed to him. Gannaway pointed out a man named

Joe Ianni as heading Civello's gambling operation. Carlos

Marcello: had on occasion visited with Joe Civello in Dallas.

Gannaway recalls that after the Appalacian Meeting, which Joe

Civello attended, uoon his return to Dallas, Chief Hanson called

Civello into his office to explain his presence at that meeting.

Civello denied all knowledge of this affair. Chief Hanson dis-

missed the matter with a stern warning to Civello that the City

of Dallas did not appreciate this kind of element.

Gannaway places. Joe Campisi in the Civello camp. He

termed Campisi as a small-time operator with only enough courage

to do small-time bookmaking. Gannaway terms Campisi as a per-

son who is afraid to be caught so consequently takes very little

risks in his gambling operation. Gannaway recollects a man

named Bosco had been arrested in a $500,000 bookmaking opera-

tion. This was a lay-off parlor for all the bookies in the

Dallas area. During the surveillance of these premises, it

was noted that Joe lanni would pay frequent visits and that

Joe Campisi would visit it on occasions.

Gannaway pointed out that Joe Campisi had purchased

the Egyptian Lounge from John Brazil Grissaffi. He describes

Grissaffi as having the reputation of being

a very tough indi-

vidual

and a "hit man.". He puts Grissaffi as a running mate of

Lois Green, who ran a loose-knit gang of criminals whose

main

objectives

were burglaries

of wholesale drug companies in order

to steal drugs. Gannaway states that this period was during

the war years where all shipping lanes were closed

to the drug

traffic. Consequently to fill up this void, Green and his mem-

bers would either hijack or burglarize these drug companies in

order to replenish the much-needed drugs. Eventually Dallas be-

came to be known as the hub of the drug traffic. The Green gang

was not as refined or organized as the Mafia

gang. Green would

supply needed money to a certain group in order that they could

engage in this sort of activity: In return, Lois Green would

receive a considerable share of their proceeds.

within the

Green gang, he would have his own selected men to carry out any

necessary enforcement. Lois Green was later killed as he came

out of a nightclub with Jack Todd. Gannaway stated that al-

though Todd and Green were close friends, he always suspected

Todd of setting up Green. Gannaway mentioned that Jack Toda

was a known safe cracker and he once locked him up for carry-

ing explosives as he was boarding a plane for New York. He

believes the type of explosives was nitro and the purpose was

either to blow up a safe in New York or to wire the explosives

to. an auto. Gannaway received this information through an in-

formant. To his knowledge, Gannaway does not believe Ruby and

Green were associated in any way. In fact,

helieve

caro

As the Commander of the Special Service Bureau, Gann-

away had first-hand information on all subversive and radical

individuals in the area. Intelligence reports would daily cross

his desk concerning these persons and he would always assign

men to check out these leads. Gannaway recalls that Agent

Hosty of the FBI would make daily visits to his office and Gann-

away would supply him with all this information. Gannaway ex-

plained that Hosty's assignment with the FBI was to supervise

subversive activities. Gannaway was. very proud of how his unit

had penetrated most of these groups. In fact, when he heard of

the President's visit he had dispatched men to Denton, Denis,

waco and other areas to keep a closer watch of

radicals in

these towns. Gannaway, informed me that he was never told about

Lee Harvey Oswald and was not aware of his existence prior to

the assassination. Gannaway stressed that more than certain

he would have had one of his men cover Lee Harvey Oswald had he

known of his presence in Dallas.

In the area of corruption within the

Department and if Jack Ruby exerted any influence with certain

members of the Dallas Police Department, Ganpaway was very

strong regarding his thoughts on this subject

Gannaway stated

that I could not be speaking to a man more informed on this

ubject as he was due to the fact that he not only headed the

Ice squad but also he was responsible, in 1948, for giving

birth to the Internal Affairs Division, whose

pnly function was

to supervise the conduct of police officers.

expected strict control over these night clubs

Name James Gilmore

Date 5-26-78

Timel: 30 P.

Address 4018 Ridglea Country Club Drivelace Office - Benbrook Police

Department

Fort worth, Texas

Interview: Staff Investigator Joseph J. Basteri interviewed Mr.

Gilmore, who is now Chief of Police for the Benbrook Police Depart-

ment since his retirement from the Dallas Police Department. Ben-

brook is a town of approximately 15,000 residents and is located

just outside Fort worth.

Chief Gilmore said that he knew Ruby quite well because

from the years 1954 to 1960 he was with the Vice Squad and as

such his duties were to pay frequent visits to dance halls and

• night clubs.. Gilmore entered the Vice Squad when he was promoted

to Lieutenant. Gilmore was familar with all of Ruby's clubs

and never knew.

them to be a hangout for hoods. Gilmore credited

Ruby with running a fairly legitimate night spot, abiding by all

the police department regulations. If any violations were ob-

served;

Ruby would be issued a summons like anyone else commit-

ting a violation:

These places were visited at least once a

night to make certain that there were no violations of the rules.

One point that Chief Gilmore wanted to emphasize

was that Ruby was not a constant visitor to police headquarters

as the papers had reported. Chier Gilmore stated Ruby only

visited headquarters in order to take care of business matters

and for no other reasons.

Chief Gilmore did state that Ruby had once told him

that he was run out of Chicago because he had crossed

someone

up and had

twenty-four hours to leave town. Ruby did not ela-

borate on too many details but Gilmore surmised that he may

have been in some kind of bar business and he had done some-

thing wrong.. Gilmore did not believe that Ruby was connected

with any mob characters in the Dallas area. According to Gil-

more, the only gang members were Dallas-ored and no one from

the outside ever penetrated this group. Gilmore agrees that

the most notorious group was the Lois Green gang and Ruby

had positively no connection with them.

On November 24, 1963 Gilmore stated he was not on

duty but home watching the television and saw Ruby shoot Os-

wald. Gilmore remarked that earlier he had seen Ruby in the

station house and. when asked what he was doing there, Ruby re-

plied that he was going to see if the homicide detectives wanted

any sandwiches. Gilmore declared that he had nothing to do

with the transfer of Oswald but heard that Captain Fritz wanted

the move to be made in the middle of the night but was opposed

by Mayor Cabell who wanted the transfer to take place in the

morning hours to please the press corps. Also, Captain Fritz

had once told Gilmore that if he did not have so many interrup-

tions he may have been more successful in the interrogation of

LHO.

When

asked about the rumors that Ruby was afraid

of him, Gilmore replied that most of the night club owners.

did not care how strict he was in his inspection of their pre-

mises. Chief Gilmore explained that when he paid these es-

tablishments a visit, it was not a social call but to care-

fully examine their premises

for any violation. At times,

these owners objected, as they did not want him to pay too much

attention to their operation. He is also certain that several

arrests were made in Ruby's clubs and clearly remembers as a

police officer he had given Ruby

a ticket for a traffic in-

fraction. Gilmore remarked that even Joe Campisi complained

that he was too strict.

The interview ended with Chief Gilmore promising to

contact me if he can recall any incident that may be useful in

this investigation.

MI. Pierce was a member of the Uniform Patrol Division

escort the armored truck out of the basement., Pierce explained that

there were two ramps in and out of the basement. The kain ramp was

the exit. The armored truck, which was going to be used as a decoy,

backed into Cormerce Street, but because of its height could not

back completely into the basement causing the ramp to be blocked.

Pierce stated that he then decided to exit the Main Street ramp so

that he could get out and then back his car into the. Commerce Street

ramp and place it in position in front of the armored truck. He

then proceeded to exit the Main Street ramp and in doing so he

noticed. o. Vaughn, who was stationed at this ramp, taking

one or two steps off the sidewalk

and into the street to safely

direct him out into the traffio. Pierce, who was with two other

members of the force did notice several persons standing

at the

entrance of the ramp, but did not know if they werewaiting

there or just walking by and waiting for his car to pass them

so that they could continue to walk. Pierce stated he knew Ruby

and Napoleon Daniels, but did not see them. In fact, Pierce

remarked that he was not aware of who was standing at the

entrance because his concentration was to maneuver his vehicle

in front of the armored truck:

Pierce does recall Vaughn being

in the gutter and he was either motioning his hands of blowing

his whistle to stop the traffic in order for him to get out of

the ramp. After leaving the ramp, he drove to Harwood Street and

made a left to Commerce Street where he made another left turn.

Pierce then said that as he arrived at Comerce Street ramp, he

does not recall whether he parked the vehicle at the curb or backe

it into the Commerce Street ramp, but at about this time, they

were aware that something had happened inside the basement.

They

imnediately ran into

the basement. and learredwhat had happened.

After LHO had been taken to Parkland Hospital, Pierce decided

also to

go there as a precaution for security reasons. He was

not ordered to go there, but took the action as a supervisor.

He does not recall entering the hospital.

Pierce admits knowing Ruby from the late forties or

early fifties as the Silver spur was on his post.

only a casual meeting. Pierce said that he would never be

afraid to go into any one of ruby's places without a nightstick

or gun as ruby ran a place where one could not get hurt.

Pierce

did say that he would not trust Ruby and always had the feeling

that he had something.to do with mob people, but could not prove

it. Pierce said he had the feeling that ruby did something wrong

to some Chicago bad guys and had to flee to Dallas. He denied that

Ruby had told him this, merely stating he just had that feeling.

Pierce believes that Dallas had no organized crime that had

eastern and northern influence. Pierce did state that Dallas did

have a criminal element, but he was never in a position to deter-.

mine how organized they were. He stated that he was always as-

signed to the Uniform Patrol Division which made it very difficult

for him to make his own observations concerning the organization

of these groups. Pierce did say that from his own knowledge, he

did not believe Ruby was linked with these criminal elements.

Interview:

Mr. Sawyer was interviewed by Staff Investigator

Joseph J. Basteri at his

restaurant, Jan's Coffee Shoo, located

at 3254 Irving Boulevard, Dallas, Texas. He has owned and operated

this restaurant since his retirement from the Dallas Police Depart-

ment in 1967. Sawyer recalls that on November 22, 1963, he was

assigned to be in charge of a detail of men on the upper portion

had passed him, he heard over the radio that

shots were fired fron

the Texas School Book Depository. Sawyer, who held the rank of

Inspector, immediately rushed to this building and had it secured.

He then organized a group of law-enforcement officers from the

Dallas Police Department, FBI, Secret Service and the Sheriff's

Office instructing them to find witnesses and possible suspects.

These witnesses were brought to the Sheriff's office where affi-

davits were taken: Sawyer had also sent a team to search the rail-

road yards as there were reports that shots may have come from

that direction and also it was good investigative procedure to

cover all surrounding areas. He recalls his men finding the three

in a box car.. Sawyer did not personally interrogate these

men, but said that they did look like hobos. Sawyer did remark

that a few years ago a writer had called him challenging several

details of a photo he saw of the police officer escorting the

three hobos. The writer was puzzled as to the type of shoes, gun

and a hearing device the police

officer had. Sawyer's answer to

the writer was that the hearing device was in fact cotton for an

ear infection the police officer had. This fact was documented

by Staff Investigator Harold Rose. The only requirement the

DED

makes as to shoes is that they must be black and this officer was

wearing black shoes. Lastly, DPD requires only that officers must

be armed with a 38 calibre or more gun. This officer was armed.

with a 45 automatic which is not an uncommon weapon for Dallas

police officers. This police officer was later identified

i as

Marvin Wise.

Although Sawyer was picked to head the unit investi-

gating the operational security

involving the transfer of Lee

Harvey Oswald, he had very little to do with it as he was hospi-

talized a week after it was formed. Sawyer did state that he was

kept well apprised of the progress of the investigation and did

assist Captain Baker who prepared the final report on the conclusion

of the investigation. Sawyer had received periodic information

from his men and after reading all reports submitted concerning

the investigation, he was positive that the shooting of Lee Harvey

Oswald by Jack Ruby was not planned because of the following

reasons:

against traffic, causing Police Officer Roy Vaughn to

leave his post momentarily enabling Ruby to enter the

basement through the unguarded ramp.

4 .

Ruby had entered the basement at almost the precise

moment that oswald was brought down. According to

sawyer, there was no way that ruby could have timed

this so perfectly: as no one knew the exact time Oswald

would be brought down. Sawyer stated that to his

knowledge no one had objected to this unit being

formed and it was terminated only after the investiga-

tion had been fully completed.

As a Lieutenant, Sawyer was in charge of the Vice

squad and as such = came to know Ruby quite weil. He had heard

rumors that Ruby was connected with mob figures while in Chicago,

but nothing has ever come to his attention to prove this runor-

Sawyer had, also heard that Ruby had to leave Chicago because of a

dispute he had with the Chicago mob. Sawyer further stated that.

he was not aware that any organized criminal element exerted any

strong influence in the city of Dallas. The only group, to his

knowledge, that could be loosely classified as organized crime

was the Lois Green outfit. Dallas, continued Sawyer, was rela-

tively a clean town with the minimum of crime or corruption.

Sawyer admits that in the late thirties and in the early forties

Dallas had more than its share of slot machines, bookie parlors,

gambling establishments and a certain part of the city was desig-

nated as the "red light district."

With the advent of World war Two, Dallas was deemed

off limits by the armed services until the city fathers could

clean up the city.

Carl Hanson was appointed. Chief of Police

and he formed a Special Service Bureau to clean up the vice,

narcotics and gambling that was flourishing in the city. George

Lumpkin was the captain in charge of this unit. Sawyer was

lieutenant in heading the vice squad under Lumpkin. During this

clean-up campaign, which took several years to fully clean up

Dallas, Sawyer stated that in no way was. Ruby's name ever linked

with this criminal element. Sawyer attributed the control of

gambling, in the forties, in the control of Benny Binion, Harry

Urban and Lloyd Sinclair. Lois Green and his group were known

to concentrate mostly on safe jobs, narcotics and prostitution.

They would frequently meet in the office of Harry Hoxsey, and

Sawyer

always suspected. that these meetings were to discuss narcotics

and fencing stolen property.

sawyer had informed me that he had set up the In-

telligence Unit for the Dallas Police Department and also insti-

tuted a filing system to properly record all pertinent facts.

One of the

functions. Of this office was to arrange a system where

police officers would not list their informants by name, but

numbers would be assigned to the informant.....It was against a

police officer's principle to reveal the name of his informant as

such. Sawyer stated that it would be difficult to say if ruby had

been an informant as there would be no official record of it.

Sawyer said he had heard that Ruby had passed on information to var-

ious police officers, but the information received was of little

importance.

Sawyer remarked that Ruby had come to Dallas in

the late forties and during this period the clean-up of dallas was

almost complete. Ruby's name never came up at any time with regard

to Ruby's having ever been connected or associated with these crim

inal figures. Sawyer always considered Ruby as a small time night

club operator who would have loved to have persons think he was more

important than he was.

Ruby's places, as well as other night. spots,

were well supervised by the vice-squad, and it never came to his

attention that Ruby had made bribe payments to any Dallas police

officer.

IHO was escorted off the elevator at the basement level and

walked past Archer, who was standing to LHO's right guarding an

inner doorway. He watched IHO proceed into the strong array of

lights and saw a man emerge from the line of detectives on LHO's

left, heard LHO say:

"Oh, no!" -- and the shot was fired as LHO

looked directly at the assailant who he (Archer) thought must have

been a plainclothes policeman. ("We all wore hats in those days.")

He and McMillon and Clardy were among the first to grab the

man and the weapon. On the floor, he said:

lingered long enough to take a close look at LHO and left with

the impression he was dead or dying.

MT. Howard P. WIllens

FROM:

Mr. Leon D. Hubert

Mr.: Burt. Griffin

SUBJECT: Author Telephone Records to be Obtained fut the Commission.

In furtherance of your conversation with ir. Griffin on February

20th and our joint memorandun of February 19, the followirg steps are

suggested to be taken as soon as possible for obtaining and preserving

telephone reoords which may be pertinent to the work of this Commission.

Some af the suggestions nay Imposa burdens upon private parties

which are not justified by the possible results to be obtained. If so,

they should be rejected and the reason for such rejection recorded in

order to assure future critios that such efforts vere carefully can-

sidered.

Paragraphs one, tro and three seek telephone numbers of phones

"reasonably avallable" to Ruby plus records of calls placed from phones

under Ruby's direct control.

Paragraph four seeks telephone numbers of all phones rcasonably

available to certain persons.

Paragraph five aels only phones. listed to ar under the control

of certain people.

Paragraph six to ten are designed to lay a basis for further

Investigation.

1. The FBI should Imediately obtain the telephone numbers, nanes

of suber der, location and type a service of all phones reasonably

avallable to Jack Faby. "Reasonably available" should include, but not

be linited to, aubscriber and pay telephones at tuc All Right Parking

Garage,

Adolphus Hotel, the Eeptian Lounge, Phil's Delicatessen,

Cabana hotel, Sol's Turf Bar, Dallas City Hall and Jail, Dallas Morning

News, Radio Station KLIF, together with any pay phones within reasorable

walking distance of said places or ary other places which ruby frequented.

Nunberg and Information concorning phones "reasonably available" to Paiby

In Dallas may be obtained by personal contact with subocribers or the

telephone company... Information as to phones avallable outside Dallas

should not involve contact with non-residents of Dallas.

HI. Boward P. Willens

February 2, 1964

2. The FBI should immediately obtain with respect to Jack Ruby,

for the period lugust 1 to November 25, 1963, copies aí all original

telephone company records bearing upon the dates, time, length of call,

calling number, billing nunber, person calling and number called eith

respect to all telephone calle (including local calls) utilizing any

telephone listed to Jack Puby of any of his clubs, including pay phones

on or near the premises. If the telephone company has no records which

would provide Information concerning local calls, the FBI should so

state.

phones would be impossi lo without further Information.

However, ve

contemplate that: 1f we establish a liat of suspected intermediaries

between Puby and Oswald, It sould be valuable to check telephones

"avallable" to Ruby against calls to the "Intermediaries". In addition,

1t may be valusble to exanine records of telephones listed to or used

regularly by suspected "Intermediaries" for onlis to phones "available"

to Ruby.

3. With respect to all records requested la paragraph tro, the

FBI should Indicate In its report what telephone company personnel were

questioned, the questions asked and the answers received, 1n all investi

gations which vere conducted, so that It may be deterined that the

recorda obtained are camplete and accurate.

He believe that the method

of searching for records must be detailed since telephone Information

forwarded so far has been spotty and Inaccurate.

4, To the extent not already provided, the FBI abould be requested

to obtain for the Coumission a liot ol all telephoned (but not call

recorda) reasonably available to the fallowing persons since March 1, 1203:

Andrew. Armstrong, 3821 Dickson Cirale, Apartment C, Dallas, Texas.

With respect to each

posalble, not only of hanc telephones but rearby pay phones, telephones

of any businesses in which

the Individual 1s employed, telephones of

business partners or other similar close busineas associates, telephones

of filands and relatives vaited frequently, and telephones at restaurants

and other businesses which the Individual is know to frequent.

For each

telephone the FBI ahould Indicate the type of service (pay phone, sub-

scriber phono, linited service telephone), name of subscribar, location

of phore, and reason for concluding the phone man accessible to the

individual under investigation.

This information should be obtzined

prinarily by examining records which will not involve personal contact

with persons outside of the telephone companias and without cormunicating

the names of suspecta to persons outside the FBI.

He realize that such

a means of Investigation will not provide a complete anower to our questions,

but se believe other modes of inquiry mould be unwise at this time.

AS

to each individual under Investigation, the FBI ropor goula indicate

what sources were checked and what other information as to possibly accessible

phones might be available by direat contact with individuals.

5. The FBI should obtata frum a telephone compary records chea

cering local telephone activity on a particular teleptone could be

subject:

Adequacy of Ruby Investigation

Past Recommendations.

In memoranda data February 19,

February 24, February 21, and March 11, we nace various

susgestions for extending the investigation Initlated by the

FBi In connection ulth the Oswald homicide.

Shortly aiter

March 11, 1964, ve began preparation for the nearly 60

depositions taken In Dallas during the period March 21-April 2;

after ve retumed from Dallas de took the deposition o1 C. L.

Crafara (tua days) and George Senator (trio days), worked on

editing the depositions taken in Dallas, and prepared for

another series of 30 other depositions taken In Dallas during

the period Aor1l 13-17. On our retum from Dallas we con-

tinued the editing of the Dallas depositions, prepared the

Dallas deposition exhibits for publication, and began working

on a draft of the report in Area V. As a consequence of all or

this activity during the period March 11-May 13, we did not

press for the conferences and discussions referred to in the

attached memoranda.

The following represents our view at this

time with respect to appropriate further investigation.

2.

General Statement ai Areas Not acequately investigaied.

In reportine an the murder oi Lee oswala oy Jack huby, we

must unster or it least advert to these questions:

a) Why did Ruby k1ll Oswald;

b) Was Ruby associated with the assassin of

President Kennedy;

c) Did Ruby have any confederates in the murder

of Ostaid?

It 1s our belief that, although the evidence sathered so far

does not show a conspiratorial link between Ruby and Oswala,

or between ruby and others, novertheless evidence should be

secured, 1f possible, to sifirmatively exclude that:

business usually occupied no more than five hours of a normal

working day which began at about 10:00 a.il. and ended at

2:00 a.I.

It was his practice to spend an average of only.

one hour a day at his Clubs between 10:00 a.I. and 9:00 p.M.

Our depositions were confined primarily to persons familiar

with Ruby's Club activities.

basic materials do make reference to such other activities

(see p. Il of our report or february 18), but these are casual

and collateral and were not explored to determine whether they

involved any underlying sinister purpose. Nor were they probed.

in such a manner as to peruit a determination as to how much of

Ruby's time they occupied.

b. Ruby has always been a person wo looked for

money-making

"sidelines."

In the two months prior to

Novenber 22, Ruby supposedit spent considerable time promoting

an exercise device known as a

"twist board.". The "trist

board" was purportedly manufactured by Plastellite Engineering,.

a Fort Worth manufacturer of oil field equipment which has

poor credit references and was the subject of an FBI investi-

gation in 1952.

We know of no sales of this item by Ruby;

1 come mon

If any "tulst boards" were manufactured for

sale.

The possibillty remains that the "twist board" was a

front for some other illegal enterprise..

Ruby has long been close to persons pursuina

Illera activities.

Although Ruby had no known ideological or #2

political interests (see p. 35 of our report of February 18),

there is nuch evidence that he was Interested In Cuban matters

In early 1959, Ruby Inquired conceining the smuggling of

persons out of cuba. He has admitted that, at that time, he

negotiated for the sale of jeeps to Castro.

In September 1959,

Ruby visited Havana at the Invitation of Las Vegas racketeer,

Louis J. Mcwillie, who paid Ruby's empenses for the trip and

who was later expelled from Cuba by Castro.... MoWillie 1s

as one of

Ruby's closest frienas.

Ruby mailed a gun to Mcwillle in early

1963.

In 1951, 1t 1s reported that ruby attended three meetings

In Dallas in connection with the sale of ams to Cubans and

the smuggling out of refugees.

The Informant identifies an

Ed Erunner as Ruby's assoclate in this endeavor. Shortly after

his arrest on Novenber 24, Ruby naned Fred Brüner as one of

his expected attorneys. Brunner did not represent Ruby,

however. Insurficient Investigation has been conducied to

confirm of deny the report about rcetings in 1961.

when Henry

Wade announced to the Press on November. 22, 1953 that Oswald

was a nember of the Free Cuba Committee, Ruby corrected Wade

by stating

brother of Jack Ruby, sent an mezplained telegram to Havana

been interested in Cuban affairs. When Ruby's car was seized

on November 24, 1t contained various right-ninz radio scripts

issued by te I, Huni and a cosy of the Wall Street Journal

bearing the walling address of a man who has not yet been

identified. In May 1963, Earl Ruby, operator of a dry cleaning

business, is known to have telephoned the Welch Candy Company

lowned by the founder of John Birch Society). The purpose of

Jack Ruby's personal notebook contained

the Massachusetts telephone number and address of Thomas R11l,

former Dallas resident, worldng at the Boston headguarters of

the wuhn Birch Society. Although 1t 1s most Ilkely that all of

those bits of clicumstanital evidence have innocent explana-

tions, none has yet been explained.

Although Ruby did not witness the notorcade through

Ruby was not questioned about this natter.

On Novenber 20,

1963, a woran, uno may be identical to Earlene Roberts, was

reportea to be in San Antonio at the time of President

Kennedy's visit.

The possible Identification of Hirs. Roberts

In San Antonio has not been cheched out. In addition, the

Iink formed by tirs. Roberts between Oswald and Ruby Is

buttressed in some measure by the fact that one of Ruby's

strippers dated a tenant of the Beckley Street rooming house

during the tenancy of Lee Oswald. He have previously suzzested

the theory that Ruby and firs. Cheek could have been involved

in Cuban arms sales of which Oswald gained Ionowledge through

his efforts to Intiltrate the anti-castro Cubans.

Our doubts

concerning the real Interest of irs. Cheek in Jack Ruby stem

fron the fact that one of her four husbands was a convicted

felon and one of her friends was a police officer to married

one of Ruby's strip-tease dancers.

He have suggested that

Ruby made of attempted to make contacts on

November 22 and 23 with persons, known and uninown, who could

have been co-conspirators:

Ruby was visited in Dallas fron

November 21 to Novenber 24, 1903 by Lawrence deyers of Chicago.

Meyers had visited Ruby tus weeks previously.

Ruby also made

a long distance call shortly after the President's death to

Alex Gruber in los Angeles. Gruber had visited ruby about

the same time as Meyers in early November. Eoth Gruber and

Heyers give innocent explanations.

Meyers claims he was 1n

Dallas enjoying life with a "aunb but accommodating broad."

Gruber clains Ruby called to say he would not mall a dog that

day,

as he had pronised to do. Finally between 11:35 p.m.

and

12 wlanight, Saturday, November 23, Ruby made a series

of brief long distance phone calls culminating with a call to

entertainer Breck Wall at a friend's house In Galveston.

We suggest that these matters cannot be left

"hanging in the air."

They hust either be explored further

of a firm decision must be made not to do so supported by

stated reasons for the decision. As a general matter, we

think the investigation deficient in these respects:

(1) Substantial time-segments in Ruby's daily

routine from September 25 to November 22 have

not been accounted for.

(2) About 45 persons who saw Ruby from November 22

to November 24 have not been questioned by staff

members, although there are fBi reports oi

Interviews with all these people.

(3) Persons who have been interviewed because of

known associations with ruby generally have :

not been investigated thenselves so that their

truthfulness can be evaluated. The FBI reports:

specifically do not attempt evaluation. The

exception has been that there the FBI has been

given incriminating evidence against Ruby, 1t

has wade further investigation to determine

wnether others might also be Implicated with

Ruby. In every case where there was some

evidence imolicating owers, those other persons:

were interlewed and denied

the incriminating

allegations. Further Investigation has not been

undertaken to resolve the conflicts.

much of our inowledge of Ruby comes from his

friends Andrew Armstrong, Ralph Paul, George

Senator,

and Larry Crafard. Investigations

have not been indertaken to corroborate their

claims.

Ruby's person, in his car, or at his home or clubs, now In

possession of the Dallas District Attorney. We already have

photos of Ruby's address books, but no other itans have been

photographed or dellvered to the Commission. These itens Include:

All are siblings of Jack Ruby. Hyman 1s the oldest chila and

talked to Jack on Novenber 22, reportedly visited Jack the week..

before the assassination, and participated in Ruby's twist

boara venture. Eva lived with Jack for 3 years in calilornia

prior to world War II, Induced Jack to come to Dallas 1n 1947,

and managed the Vegas Club for Jack in Dallas from 1959 to

1963. Earl was a travelling salesman with Jack from 1941-1943;

a business partner 1940-1947, and made phone calls beiore

November 22, 1953 and aiterwards which require explanations.

Seth Kantor. This person was interviewed trice

and persists in his claim that he

saw Ruby at Parkland Hospital shortly before

or after the President's death was announced.

Ruby denies that ha was ever at Parkland

Hospital.

We must decide who is telling the

truth, for there would be considerable signifi-

cance 1f 1t were concluded that Ruby is IJing.

Should we make an evaluation without seeing

Kantor ourselves?

Oswald at the Carousel Club prior to Novencer 22,

and this mmor perhaps more than any other has

been given wide circulation. Should ve evalu-

Andrew Armstrong was very active in the

operation of the Carousel and worked closely

with Ruby for 18 months.

His deposition covers

Ruby's activitles and emotional state generally

and particularly several hours on Novenuer 22

and

23.

A background check should be conducted

as to this person and selected parts of his

testimony should be checked out to test his

veracity.

Karen and Bruce Carlin were the recipionts of

a $25 money order bought by ruby approsimately

5 minutes before ruby shot Oswald.

Karen Carlin. Background checks should be

conducted on the Carlins.

We have obtained these radio tapes for all except

interviews with key witnesses in the oswald area. In addition,

the tapes shed consideraole light on the manner in which Dallas

public officials and federal agents conducted the investi-

gations and parformed in public view. We believe that similar

video tapes and novle films should be obtained from NBC, CBS,

Messrs. Leon D. Hubert, Jr. and Burt W. Griffin

Howard P. Willens

SUBJECT: Adequacy of Ruby Investigation:

As we'all knor, your senorandun dated May I4, 1904,

bearing the above title has been the subject of considerable

discussion, noons the tiro of you, iir. Bankin, Fir. Redlich and

me.

As a result of those discussions steps have been taken

to implement most of the specific Investigative recoumendations

set forth in section y beginning on page t. In lact, It appears

to me that all of these requests are in the process of being

implerented througs subsection g vI entitled Breck Wall, with

the exception that so background Investigation has been requested

regarding kir. Hall. As to the recomendation in subsection & vil

that background investigation be conducted regarding the six nuned

persons, it has been decided that no such general Investigation Is

werranted. It was agreed, however, that any luvestigative requests

submitted by you regarding specific testimony of these persons, in

order to test veracity, night be appropriate.

On Hay 27, 1964 I alscussed with Me. Griitin the status

of the investigation in Area 5. Inis discussion was prompted not

only by your memorandud dated May I, but also the discussion held

In Kr. Rankin's oliice on the prior day, May 20, dealing with the

initial dratt sumitted by you relating to Ruby's background.

I requested Mr. Griffin to stop his current work on the first draft

and subalt to me within the next few business days every single

Investigative raquest nich he believes 1s necessary to complete

the investigation in his arca. Mr. Griffin pgrcen to this and I

have today received appoxinately 10 such Investigatire requests,

which have elther been sent forward to Mr. Runkin for approval. and

signature or, atter discussion with Mr. Griffin, are being revised.

It any additional requests are contemalated, I vould like to ba

advised today.
