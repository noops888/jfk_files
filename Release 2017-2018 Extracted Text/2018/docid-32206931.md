MOVIMIENTO RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIO (MRA

On December 9, 1963, a source of information on

Cuban matters whose reliability has not as yet been established,

informed that he has been in contact with Abel Mesa

who has

been designated a delegate of the Movimiento Recuperacion

Revolucionario (MRR) for the Minneapolis

area.

He

said that

he is a frequent visitor of the Mesa residence, and on many

occasions has entered into a poker

game with Mesa and other

Cuban friends.

This source related that during one of the

recent poker games, he learned that the

MRR is sending a

five-man team into Cuba once a month for the purpose of

assassination. He said the principal targets for assassination

are Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Che Guevera.

This source

speculated that lesser Cuban officials are probably designated

for assassination.

This source advised that sometime during the summer

months of 1963, Fidel Castro was traveling in a motorcade in

Havana and had

stopped approximately two blocks along the

scheduled route totalk to some school children.

Castro's

car proceded on and approximately two blocks

from

where he

left his vehicle,

assassins laced Castro's car_-with bullets

and killed all occupants.

The source was unable to recall

the date;

however,

on this same day, he talked to Abel Mesa

who informed him

the word of

the aborted assassination of

Fidel Castro had been received in Minneapolis,

Minnesota two

hours after

the event occurred.

The source related that in

this respect,

the MAR has, clandestine shortwave radios spotted

in Cuba, and

information

is received in Miami after which

it

is relayed by telephone to various MRR delegates throughout

the United States.

The source informed that for the most

part, MRR uses the telephone as a deans of communication,
