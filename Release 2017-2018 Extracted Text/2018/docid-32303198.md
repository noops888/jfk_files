GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka

SAMUEL. MANNARINO, aka

2/23/62

Remyairtel 2/5/52, and reBuairtel 2/7/62.

On 2/19/62, Special Agent JOHN SHWARTZ,

Intelligence Division,

IRS, Pittsburgh, Pa., advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III as

follows:

SCHWARTZ was in Chicago, Illinois 2/14-16/62, awaiting his

turn to testify as a Government witness in the case

"BERNARD

J. EZHAYA,

et al; ITSP-NT."

AUSA MANION, Chicago, told

'SCHWARTZ that he expects to use JOSEPH VEROLA, Forner Miami

CI, as a witness for the Government, and it is fully belleved

that defendant WILLIAM RABIN will take the stand and impli-

cate his co-defendants, Including SAMUEL MANNARINO.

It is noted that both MEROLA and RABIN have been associates

and friends of the MANNARINOS for many years.

The above

information.from Schwartz was furnished the same day by SA

FORSYTH to Departmental Attorney JOHN MULLANEY.

MULLANEY stated that he believed that it would be better to

postpone the interview of DANIEL HANNA at Federal Penitentiarys.

Lewisburg, Pa., until after MEROLA and RABIN testify.

sald he felt that the testimony of these two men might be

a selling point with HANNA to demonstrate that others were

"turning on the MANNARINOS to save ,themselves.
