cate his co-defendants, including SAMUEL MANNARING. E

postpone the interview of DANIEL HANNA at Federal Penitentiary, fe
Lewisburg, Pa., until after MEROLA and RABIN téstify. He z
sald he felt that the testimony of these two men might be £3 |

a selling point with HANNA, to: demonstrate that others were
"turning on the MANNARINOS to save themselves,"
