Agents of the fBl on January 25, 1955

at

which time she advised that her activity

in the CP as well as that of her husband,

HAROLD DRIGGS, began in the middle 1930s

during the depression in Tacoma, Washington.

She said that when she and her husband

moved to Seattle, Washington, they continued

their membership and activity in the CP

and in the Communist Political Association

(CPA) .

She said that as a result of open

criticism of CP functionaries on her part

and on the part of her husband, she and her

husband were expelled from the

CP in 1946,

with the

proviso that after six months they

would reinstate. She said, however, that

she and her husband moved and that they did

not reinstate.

The CPA has been designated by the Attorney

General of the United States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

LEE COE was one of the leaders of a

Factional group of the CP who were meeting

with the District Board of the CP to iron

out the factional difficulties.

The Department of the Navy in its analysis

Of JOSEPH PARKER MORRAY'S book,

"Pride of

State," published in 1959, says that in his

general attitude toward American foreign

policy and his view of communist activity,

MORRAY echoes the CP line at every point.

To him, the communists are authentic

nationalists and the Korean War was a

"domestic dispute."

He, in effect, labels

all American efforts to resist communist

expansion as capitalist imperialism.

A NG leaflet has been furnished showing the following

information:

"In protest at the Bikini death and poisoning of Japanese

Professor Yasui launched a petition drive in which

30,000,000 signatures were collected. The protest led to

senting 35,000,000 Japanese citizens.

"At the 1962 Hiroshima Conference serious divisions developed

because the conference failed to condemn Soviet as well as

U.S. nuclear tests. Further divisions within Gensuikyo caused

Due to the

LANE then proceeded to attack the fourteen point

case that the Dallas District Attorney's Office had against

LEE HARVEY OSWALD. This portion of LANE's talk was almost

word for word a repetition of his brief which appeared in

the December 19, 1963 issue of the NG.

LANE concluded his talk with an attack on the

Warren Commission claiming that this or any other commission

was only as good as the agencies that supplied it with

information.

His position was that the FBI, the Secret

service, and the Dallas Police Department nad ali tormed

an opinion before the conclusion of the case and were

merely supplying the Warren

Commission with information

that would further substantiate their own conclusions.

LANE said he wrote a legal brief on the OSWALD

case, but no newspaper

the NG. He reviewed the fifteen points in the case against

OSWALD as presented by Dallas authorities and in his brief

he attacked these points.

He said Dallas authorities and

the Secret Service did a poor job in getting and preparing

evidence in the OSWALD case.

LANE went on to list contradictory statements

that have. been made in the OSWALD case with regard to the

following:

The make of the rifle involved, paraffin test

proving OSWALD did not fire the rifle, the name of the taxi

driver, the entry of the bullets, the number of shots fired,

OSWALD's marksmanship, why OSWALD took a bus or taxi to get

his jacket, the late revelation of OSWALD's alias and why

OSWALD obtained a mail order rifle.

LANE wanted an investigation of people on the over-

pass and the tie to Officer TIPPIT's murder.

LANE questioned the inactivity of ROBERT KENNEDY.

He asked why OSWALD was not watched and why the secret

Service chief was not in Dallas. LANE also said that he

thought OSWALD's Marxism was not motivation for assassination

since he spoke well of KENNEDY and should have been aware

of better relations with the USSR. LANE also stated that

A report of the HUAC, House of Representatives,

36th Congress, First

Session, captioned

'Communist Lobbying Activities In The Nation's

Capitol," was released on September 3, 1959.

This report was in part concerned with

lobbying activities of the United Electrical,

Radio and Machine Workers of America,

commonly known as the UE.

This section of

the report states that RUSSELL ARTHUR (RUSS)

NIXON has lobbied for the UE in Washington

since 1941, with the exception of a two year

period during World War II. The report

states in part:

"UE's Washington lobbyist, RUSS NIXON,

has been identified as a member of the

Communist Party by three former Communists

in sworn public testimony before the HUAC.

Two of them, VICTOR DECAVITCH, a witness

on July 14, 1950, and SAMUEL DI MARIA,

testifying on October 15, 1952, had worked

in the same union organization as RUSS NIXON

in the 1940s.

Mr. DECAVITCH stated that it

was his belief that NIXON--at one time was

one of the most effective, most influential

persons in the city of Washington

as far as

the labor

movement was concerned."

On February 8, 1964, the NG sponsored a talk by

any misconceptions about President KENNEDY's assassination.

LANE went into the background of the case beginning

with President KENNEDY's arrival in Dallas and he exhibited

a newspaper which contained a full-page advertisement by a

right wing group asking questions of President KENNEDY, such

as why he had

gone soft on communism.

LANE stated that General

WALKER lived in Dallas and that of all the cities in the

United States, Dallas was the city where the right wing

groups were the strongest.

LANE also discussed OSWALD's background. He said

OSWALD was a young man who had not made a success of anything

and that he had drifted in and out of the Marine Corps and in and

various schools in the country.

He said OSWALD

went to the Soviet Union, was dissatisfied, and came back

to this country.

LANE went on and tried to establish a

link between OSWALD and the head of the FBI in Dallas,

pointing out that OSWALD nad the telephone number of

FBI Special Agent in Charge.

LANE tried to make the point

that OSWALD had been selected as the frame-up victim because

of the record of his unstable character and also because he

had a past record of association with left wing groups.

LANE

then claimed that in his opinion OSWALD was not the person

who squeezed the trigger of the gun that killed President

KENNEDY and that he was

simply a fall guy.

He claimed that

OSWALD's record as a Marine did not indicate he was the

type of superb shooter who could hit an object as small as a

man's

head at seventy-five yards in a moving car.

GREENE stated that China is progressing rapidly

to become one of the world's foremost powers.

He felt that

the United States'

attitude towards this nation was back-

ward and detrimental to world peace and United States

prestige.

He said there was a marked lessening of anti-

American feeling in China today that was not noticeable

in 1960 when he made his first trip. GREENE attributed

the present feud between Russia and China to many things,

Including the withdrawal of Russian technicians in 1960.

According to GREENE, however, the prime cause of the

dissention between Russia and China is the possibility

that Russia will

actually make a cut back in arms develop-

ment, forcing China to shift a great percentage of her

resources and engineering to the construction of a nuclear

weapon in defense

against the United States.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (FPCC)

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times" news-

paper contained a full-page advertisement captioned, "What Is

Really Happening In Cuba?," placed by the Fair Play for Cuba

This advertisement announced the formation

of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC intended to

promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize

the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961, re-

ported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961, Dr.

Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber as

organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and Taber obtained

funds from the Cuban Government, which were applied toward the

cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

on May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the first

two years of the FPCC's

was a struggle between

the Communist Party (CP) and Socialist workers Party (SP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby in-

fluence FPCC poliCy. However, during the past year this source

ommuni exPert the forever, esse

observed

there has

been a successful effort by FPCC leadership

to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the

FPCC so that today their influence is negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second.

source advised that the

National Headquarters of

the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799

Broadway, New lork city. According to this source, the position

of National Office Director was created in the Fall of 1962,

and

was Illled by Vincent "Ted" Lee, who now formulates FPCC policy.

This source observed Lee has followed a course of entertaining

and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations, in-

cluding the CP and the SiP, when he has felt it would be to his

personal benefit as well as the FPCC's.

However, Lee has in-

dicated to this source he has no intention of permitting FPCC

policy to be determined by any other organization.

Lee

feels

the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic relations

between Cuba and the United States and support the right of

Cubans to manage their revolution without interference from

other nations, but not support the cuban revolution per se.

The CP and the SWP have been designated pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.

INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVE PARTY

The 1955 Report of the California Committee on

Un-American Activities,

Page 46, stated, "The Independent

Progressive Party in California

was quickly captured by the

Wallace for President campaign

barrel by the Communist Party of California.

Time after time

the committee in questioning witnesses throughout the State

discovered that the leaders of the Communist Parties in various

localities

were identical with the leaders of the Independent

Progressive Party in the same area. It is true, of course,

that in the Indedendent Progressive Party there were many

sincere liberals who,

because of dissatisfaction with the two

major political organizations registered as Independent

Progressives and

continued their

affiliation until the true

control of the I.P.P. became obvious. These people invariably

resigned,

many of

them having given the benefit of their

experience to various official agencies interested in the

exposure of subversive activities."

were adopted by the NYCAHUAC.

One such resolution affirmed

the intention to continue to work for the abolition of the

House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) and to

continue its efforts to broaden the participation in this

fight.

Another resolution accepted

as a modus vivendi the

suggestion of the Field Representative of the "National

Committee to Abolish the HCUA" (NCAHUAC) namely that local

abolition committees may identify and co-ordinate their

efforts

as closely as they desire with NCAHUAC, still

maintaining their autonomy for as flexible and independent

a program

as

possible:

Various sources have advised during March, 1962,

that Communist Party (CP) members in the New York City area

have been solicited to support activities of the NYCAHUAC

during attendance at CP club meetings.

On May 6, 1963, the first source advised that the,

NYCAHUAC continues

to function from its office at 150 West
