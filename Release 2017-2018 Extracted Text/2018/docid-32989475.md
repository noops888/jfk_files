A characterization of the NG is contained
in the appendix.

MARGARET DRIGGS was interviewed by Special
Agents of the FBI on January 25, 1955, at
which time she advised that her activity

in the CP as well as that of her husband,
HAROLD DRIGGS, began in the middle 1930s
during the depression in Tacoma, Washington.
She said that when she and her husband
moved to Seattle, Washington, they continued
their membership and activity in the CP

and in the Communist Political Association
(CPA). She said that as.a result of open
eriticism of CP functionaries on her part
and on the part of her husband, she and her
husband were expelled from the CP in 1946,
with the proviso that after six months they
would reinstate. She said, however, that
she and her husband moved and that they did
not reinstate.

The CPA has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

LEE COE was one of the leaders of a
factional group of the CP who were meeting
with the District Board of the CP to iron
out the factional difficulties.

SF T-1 - 11/29/63

The Department of the Navy in its analysis
of JOSEPH PARKER MORRAY's book, “Pride of
State," published in 1959, says that in his
general attitude toward American foreign
policy and his view of communist activity,
MORRAY echoes the CP line at every point.
To him, the communists are authentic
nationalists and the Korean War was a
“domestic dispute.” He, in effect, labels
all American efforts to resist communist
expansion as capitalist imperialism.

ANG leaflet has been furnished showing the following
information:

"KAORU YASUI

"Kaoru Yasui, member of the Board of Governors and Dean of the
Law Faculty at Tokyo's Hosei University (30,000 students), is
a world-renowned authority in international law. As founder
and chairman of Gensuikyo - the Japan Council Against Atomic
and Hydrogen Boinbs - Professor Yasui is known as ‘father of
the nuclear disarmament movement in Japan.'

Fj "In protest at the Bikini death and poisoning of Japanese
t fishermen and the contamination of fish from these tests,
Professor Yasui laungHed a petition drive in which
30,000,000 signa Ss were collected. The protest led to
"i she formation ogfGensuikyo with the participation of major
t labor, political’\ wo d youth organizations repre-
senting 35,000,000 Japanese citizens.
"At the 19862 Hiroshima Conference serious divisions developed
because the conference failed to condemn Soviet as well as
U.S, nuclear tests. Further divisions within Gensuikyo caused
Professor Yasui to resign temporarily with the statement that
in Japan, the only country which had actually experienced
atomic bombings , there is a 'strong determination there shall
never again be A and H bombs. This natural sentiment must
' be respected. It is impossible to oppose nuclear tests by
one particular country and support nuclear tests by another
particular country.'

| “As the 1963 anniversary of Hiroshima approached, pressure

: mounted for the recall of Professor Yasui to reunite
Gensuikyo. With patience and skill, Professor Yasui organized
the conference held in Hiroshima this past August and steered
it through stormy sessions which restated the “overwhelming
Japanese opposition to all nuclear arms in Japan and through-
out the world.

The 8th World Convention Against Atomic

and Hydrogen Bombs ended late in the.
evening of August 6, 1962. Due to the
confusion caused by political parties
attempting to utilize this convention,

and a head-on clash between the Japan
Socialist Party (JSP) and the Japanese
Communist Party (JCP), no unified resa-
lution or declaration was adopted. The

JSP presented a last minute motion calling
for a protest against Soviet nuclear

testing in the name of the Gensuikyo Conven-
tion. The JCP, supported by the Chinese ~
Communist delegation, rejected with force
the socialist proposal. This led to a walk-
out by the socialists, and the convention
was adjourned in a near riot atmosphere. (2)

A meeting of the NG was held on October 3, 1963,
at the American Russian Institute (ARI), 90 Me Allister
Street, San Francisco, to plan for a coming talk by KAORU
YASUI. While discussing a chairman for the coming event,
the individuals present at the meeting agreed that, if
possible, the chairman should be someone not too far to
the left so that outsiders would be encouraged to..come.
MARGARET DRIGGS phoned various individuals and invited them
to attend this meeting. Approximately thirteen people

attended.

The ARI of San Francisco has been designated
by the Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

On November 17, 1963, the NG sponsored a public
meeting at the Scottish Rite Auditorium, Van Ness Avenue
and Sutter Street, San Francisco, California, attended by
approximately three hundred individuals. JOSEPH P. MORRAY,
chairman of the meeting, introduced Professor KAORU YASUI.
YASUI stated that he was making a ten-day tour of the
United States. He said he had a lot of trouble in obtaining
a visa in coming to the United States and did not know
whether he could come again.

YASUI talked about Nagasaki and Hiroshima and said
he wanted to obtain 35,000,000 signatures to ban all nuclear
weapons. He said Okinawa was heavily armed with United
States nuclear weapons and that this put Japan in great
danger. He said that in the next year there would be a world
peace conference in Japan and he asked that as many
delegates as possible attend from the United States.

YASUI praised some of the women present in the audience
who had recently attended a peace march in Japan.

YASUI also read a poem which expressed grief at
losing so many lives during the Nagasaki and Hiroshima
tragedies. He discussed the after affects of radiation and
the deformities of his people. YASUI said that he had
talked to Premiere KHRUSHCHEV and MAO Tse-tung concerning
the banning of nuclear weapons. He also talked to these two
men on the Soviet - China dispute, which he described as
being very bad, but which would eventually be ironed out.
YASUI said he sent letters to KHRUSHCHEV, MAO and President
KENNEDY concerning the banning of nuclear arms, but that the
United States Ambassador rejected his letter and it never
reached President KENNEDY.

At this point, JOSEPH P. MORRAY pointed out that
this showed the United States was not interested in going
along with other countries. YASUI went on to say that the
political climate was changing and that he believed
socialist countries would be able to come to some understanding.
Following YASUI, MARGARET DRIGGS made a collection speech,
and BARBARA DANE from Vancouver, B.C. sang a number of folk
songs , mainly pertaining to the bad housing and econoinic
conditions of the Bay Area. A question and answer period
followed.

meeting at the Scottish Rite Auditorium, Van Ness Avenue

people attended, The guest speaker, KAORU YASUI, was
introduced by JOSEPH P. MORRAY. YASUI opened his talk by
praising the NG. He said that all tests and bombs must
be banned along with complete disarmament. He played up
the dropping of bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and added

that he did not defend the bombing of Pearl Harbor which
was not the people's choice. He said the rift between
Russia and China has hurt the peace movement in Japan,

LANE then proceeded to attack the fourteen point
case that the Dallas District Attorney's Office had against
LEE HARVEY OSWALD. This portion of LANE's talk was almost
word for word a repetition of his brief which appeared in
the December 19, 1963 issue of the NG.

LANE concluded his talk with an attack on the
Warren Commission claiming that this or any other commission
was only as good as the agencies that supplied it with
information. His position was that the FBI, the Secret
Service, and the Dallas Police Department had all formed
an opinion before the conclusion of the case and were
merely supplying the Warren Commission with information
that would further substantiate their own conclusions. At
the end of the speeches, a collection was taken to aid in
financing LANE's tour.

including in the Soviet Union. Among
other things, he commented that the
Soviets are the saviours of the world

SF T-7 advised on April 15, 1963, that
VINCENT HALLINAN was elected Chairman of
the Bay Area Fair Play for Cuba Committee
(FPCC).

A characterization of the Bay Area FPCC
is contained in the appendix.

On February 8, 1964, the NG sponsored a talk by
MARK LANE at the California Hall, San Francisco. In his
talk LANE stated that he was interested in defending the
legal doctrine of "Presumption of Innocence". LANE con-
demned the hate atmosphere in Dallas, Texas, prior to
President KENNEDY's arrival, including the "Kennedy - Dead
or Alive posters." He said no man could have gotten a fair
trial during the hysteria following KENNEDY's assassination.

LANE said he wrote a legal brief on the OSWALD
case, but no newspaper or magazine would accept it except
the NG. He reviewed the fifteen points in the case against
OSWALD as presented by Dallas authorities and in his brief
he attacked these points. He said Dallas authorities and
the Secret Service did a poor job in getting and preparing
evidence in the OSWALD case.

LANE went on to jist contradictory statements
that have. been made in the OSWALD case with regard to the
following:

The make of the rifle involved, paraffin test
proving OSWALD did not fire the rifle, the name of the taxi
driver, the entry of the bullets, the number of shots fired,
OSWALD's marksmanship, why OSWALD took a bus or taxi to get
his jacket, the late revelation of OSWALD's alias and why
OSWALD obtained a mail order rifle.

LANE wanted an investigation of people on the over-
pass and the tie to Officer TIPPIT's murder.

LANE questioned the inactivity of ROBERT KENNEDY.
He asked why OSWALD was not watched and why the Secret
Service chief was not in Dallas. LANE also said that he
thought OSWALD's Marxism was not motivation for assassination
since he spoke well of KENNEDY and should have been aware
of better relations with the USSR. LANE also stated that
he would not comment on the JACK RUBY case.

“SF T-14 - 2/12/64

A report of the HUAC, House of Representatives,
86th Congress, First Session, captioned
"Communist Lobbying Activities In The Nation's
Capitol," was released on September 3, 1959.
This report was in part concerned with
lobbying activities of the United Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers of America,

commonly known as the UE. This section of
the report states that RUSSELL ARTHUR (RUSS)
NIXON has lobbied for the UE in Washington
since 1941, with the exception of a two year
period during World War II. The report

states in part:

"UE's Washington lobbyist, RUSS NIXON,

has been identified as a member of the
Communist Party by three former Communists
in sworn public testimony before the HUAC.
Two of them, VICTOR DECAVITCH, a witness

on July 14, 1950, and SAMUEL DI MARTA,
testifying on October 15, 1952, had worked
in the same union organization as RUSS NIXON
in the 1940s. Mr. DECAVITCH stated that it
was his belief that NIXON--at one time was
one of the most effective, most influential
persons in the city of Washington as far as
the labor movement was concerned."

On February 8, 1964, the NG sponsored a talk by
MARK LANE at the California Hall, San Francisco. The
speakers stand included VINCENT HALLINAN, who acted as
Master of Ceremoniés, MARK LANE and RUSS NIXON of the NG.
HALLINAN introduced LANE as the person who could clear up
any misconceptions about President KENNEDY's assassination.

LANE went into the background of the case beginning
with President KENNEDY's arrival in Dallas and he exhibited
a newspaper which contained a full-page advertisement by a
right wing group asking questions of President KENNEDY, such
as why he had gone soft on communism. LANE stated that General
WALKER lived in Dallas and that of all the cities in the
United States, Dallas was the city where the right wing
groups were the strongest.

LANE also discussed OSWALD's background. He said
OSWALD was a young man who had not made a success of anything
and that he had drifted in and out of the Marine Corps and in and
out of various schools in the country. He said OSWALD
went to the Soviet Union, was dissatisfied, and came back
to this country. LANE went on and tried to establish a
link between OSWALD and the head of the FBI in Dallas,
pointing out that OSWALD had the telephone number of the
FBI Special Agent in Charge. LANE tried to make the point
that OSWALD had been selected as the frame-up victim because
of the record of his unstable character and also because he
had a past record of association with left wing groups. LANE
then claimed that in his opinion OSWALD was not the person
who squeezed the trigger of the gun that killed President
KENNEDY and that he was simply a fall guy. He claimed that
OSWALD's record as a Marine did not indicate he was the
type of superb shooter who could hit an object as small as a
man's head at seventy-five yards in a moving car.

FELIX GREENE at the California Hall, Polk and Turk Streets,
San Fraycisco. Approximately 700 - 800 people attended.
CHARL VARRE, chairman of the meeting, introduced FELIX
GREENE ‘as’ the featured speaker and said that GREENE had been
to Red China on three different occasions. GREENE spoke
about his last trip to Red China and he said that during this

trip he tried to explain the American point of view to Red
Chinese leaders but was unsuccessful. He said the Chinese
did not want American friendship except on their terms. He
said that membership in the United Nations means nothing
to them and that they are a growing and very powerful
nation. He said the Chinese refer to the United States as
a "paper tiger" which did not mean that we did not have

any power, but rather that we could not use it without

| condemnation of the world.

GREENE went on to say that he saw no evidence of
preparations for war and that the militia he had seen on
previous visits had been done away with. He said there
were two provinces he could not get into, Sing Hai (ph) and
} Tibet. He believed that the atomic emergency programs were
conducted there. GREENE said that instead of the anti-
American slogans he had seen on his previous visits, there
are now posters encouraging safety and courtesy. GREENE
said that the split between Russia and China is very deep.
However, he said the Soviet Government would probably defend
the Chinese in the event of war. He noted that the Soviets
had removed their technicians and some of their skilled
workers but that the Chinese were getting outside help from
other socialist countries.

GREENE also stated that the Chinese view the
current struggle as one against United States imperialism
and that they feel that anyone who assists the United
Nations is a potential enemy. GREENE said that he felt that
the United States made a terrible mistake in not recognizing
China. He also stated that the Chinese did not like the
| Soviet support of NEHRU in India during the dispute between
| India and China.

On February 14, 1964, the NG sponsored a talk by
FELIX GREENE at the California Hall, San Francisco. Close
to one thousand people attended. It was pointed out that
FELIX GREENE had just returned from China where he had been
visiting legally on a British passport. He was described
as the English born son of American parents, making him a
eitizen of both countries.

GREENE stated that China is progressing rapidly
to become one of the world's foremost powers. He felt that
the United States' attitude towards this nation was back-
ward and detrimental to world peace and United States
prestige. He said there was a marked lessening of anti-
American feeling in China today that was not noticeable
in 1960 when he made his first trip. GREENE attributed
the present feud between Russia and China to many things,
including the withdrawal of Russian technicians in 1960.
According to GREENE, however, the prime cause of the
dissention between Russia and China is the possibility
that Russia will actually make a cut back in arms develop-
ment, forcing China to shift a great percentage of her
resources and engineering to the construction of a nuclear
weapon in defense against the United States.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (FPCC)

: The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times" news-
paper contained a full-page advertisement captioned, "What Is
Really Happening In Cuba?," placed by the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the formation
of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC intended to
promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize
the distorted American press.

“The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961, re~-
ported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961, Dr.
Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber as
organizers of the FPCC, He also testified he and Taber obtained
funds from the Cuban Government, which were applied toward the
cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the first
two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle between
the Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Yorkers Party (SYP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby in-
fluence FPCC policy. However, during the past year this source
‘observed there has been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that today their influence is negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the
National Headquarters of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799
Broadway, New York City. According to this source, the position
of National Office Director was created in the Fall of 1962, and
was filled by Vincent "Ted" Lee, who now formulates FPCC policy.
This source observed Lee has followed a course of entertaining
and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations, in-
eluding the CP and the SYP, when he has felt it would be to his
- personal benefit as well as the FPCC's. However, Lee has in-
dicated to this source he has no intention of permitting FPCC
policy to be determined by any other orgenization. Lee feels
the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic relations
between Cuba and the United States and support the right of
Cubans to manage their revolution without interference from
other nations, but not support the Cuban revolution per se.

The CP and the SWP have been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVE PARTY

The 1955 Report of the California Committee on
Un-American Activities, Page 46, stated, "The Independent
Progressive Party in California was quickly captured by the
communists, and by the time the Wallace for President campaign
had swung into hich gear was being operated lock, stock, and
barrel by the Communist Party of California. Time after time
the committee in questioning witnesses throughout the State
discovered that the leaders of the Communist Parties in various
localities were identical with the leaders of the Independent
Progressive Party in the same area. It is true, of course,
that in the Independent Progressive Party there were many
sincere liberals who, because of dissatisfaction with the two
major political organizations registered as Independent
Progressives and continued their affiliation until the true
control of the I.P.P. became obvious. These people invariably
vesigned, many of them having given the benefit of their
experience to various official agencies interested in the
exposure of subversive activities."

NEW YORK COUNCIL TO ABOLISH
THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES
COMMITTEE

On March 9, 1961, a source advised that the
New York Council To Abolish the Un-American Activities
Committee (NYCAUAC), 150 West 34th Street, New York City,
New York, was formed at a meeting held in New York City
on November 17, 1960. This organization was founded
principally through the efforts of FRANK WILKINSON,
Field Representative of the National Committee to Abolish
the Un-American Activities Committee (NCAUAC).

A second source advised on September 17, 1952,
that FRANK WILKINSON was a Communist Party member as of
September, 1952.

A third source furnished on September 14, 1961, a
copy of resolutions of the New York Council to Abolish the
House Un-American Activities Committee (NYCAHUAC) which
were adopted by the NYCAHUAC. One such resolution affirmed
the intention to continue to work for the abolition of the
House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) and to
continue its efforts to broaden the participation in this
fight. Another resolution accepted as a modus vivendi the
suggestion of the Field Representative of the "National
Committee to Abolish the HCUA" (NCAHUAC) namely that local
abolition committees may identify and co-ordinate their
efforts as closely as they desire with NCAHUAC, still
maintaining their autonomy for as flexible and independent
a program as possible.

Various sources have advised during March, 1962,
that Communist Party (CP) members in the New York City area
have been solicited to support activities of the NYCAHUAC
during attendance at CP club meetings.

On May 6, 1963, the first source advised that the,
NYCAHUAC continues to function from its office at 150 West
34th Street, New York City, New York.
