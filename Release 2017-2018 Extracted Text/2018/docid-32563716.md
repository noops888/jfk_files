requested counsel at which time his final arraignment was deferred. On

| sonation count in the indictment. The count charging Illegal Wearing of the

1946, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment.

fifteen fraudulent checks in Chicago, Illinois, Baltimore, Maryland, and Dallas,
Texas. The approximate value of these checks was nine hundred dollars by his
own estimation. It will be noted that in Detroit phe checks were passed upon
«the father of a sailor with whom the convict had struck up an acquaintance
and-bywhom he was being entertained.

He has also admitted that while in Baltimore, Maryland ry
he was able to pass several fraudulent checks among the friends of his wife
after he had induced his wife tg endorse the checks in the belief they were
bona fide. At the time of his apprehension on February 13, 1946, at Chicago, ,
Illinois, he had in his possession numerous official papers of the United
States Navy purporting to show that he was a bona fide member of the armed
, Service on re-enlistment leave, that he had received a certificate of honor=
vable discharge for prbvious service, that he was entitled to wear several
campaign ribbons afid Mecorations including the Purple Heart.
