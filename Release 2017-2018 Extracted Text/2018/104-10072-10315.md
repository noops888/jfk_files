I. The purpose of this dispatch is to raise what we believe

to be as operational prospect worth careful study. The proposal

is necessarily sonewhat tentative at this point, but we believe it

is desirable to share it with Headquarters now in order that its

early consideration may be facilitated.

2.. As you are arate.

las developed excellent contacts

with individuals active in the Paris SHCC group- Identity A, who

is one of these, has recently becone Increasingly active in the

affairs of the SNCC group (which largely centers around several.

young girls recently arxived from the US) and has come to play a

rather important tole since she brings to it a sophistication and

Identity A would not nomally have becone active in the SHCC group.

She is older and holds "noderate" views of the sort held by the

late De. Martin Iuther Ring: However, she recently tool a rather

militant position at a public discusion of civil rights (primarily

to avoid confrontation with and critician by the SNCC girls) after

which she was admiringly besieged by the girls who were anxious to

have her assistance in preparation of speeches, etc. In this

legard Please see Reference. Partly because she has the time and

partly because she was flattered, Identity A accepted and has grown

daily nore involved in SNCC matters. At the moment she is devoting

virtually full time to this.

reports that Identity A is charming, highly female,

definitely intelligent and something of an "actress" in that she is

often willing to tell people what they want to hear; indeed, this is

what she did at the public discussion mentioned above..... At the same

time she is committed to the civil rights movement.

You will note

from the biographical data which we are forwarding under separate

cover, that she bas worked in civil rights activities before and at

one point assisted in the organization of a march led by Dr. King-

who is a personal friend of the fanily (she is divorced

and has a teenaged girl) in addition to being the representative of

her publisher, has gotten to know her very well over the past years.

He reports that she 18 basically a loyal, moderate and anti-Communist

person who comes from a middle class family in Detroit where her

pareats were active in the anti-Communtst activities of the United

Anto Workers.. At one point

had proposed her for possible

use since she might be able to gain accesa to forth Vietnam. This

was rejected, however, because she was thought to be too moderate,

respectable and pro-American to be of interest to the North Vietnamese.

4. All this has been altered by her recent involvement in the

SuCC actiwities, and it is nome

apinion that she offers

what way-be a unique opportunity to obtata the collaboration of

someone In a position to report on the attempts by Commist, Castro

ist, and radical forces to influence and use the civil rights move-

nent.: Through her involverent in SNCC she has developed contacts

with vacious groups which are flirting with Sace such as the Franch

Vietnan lational Cormittee, Vletnamese student groups and the Che

Guevata Circle all targots of HOFIRM.

a leading public representative of SICC. Another candidate for a

leading raky in sic following the departure of Identity 3 1s the

Is convinced that Identity A would be willing to

collabotact with her government but stresues that the approach to

her would raguire great skill and mat ba done by an individual with

whos she coald feel rapport. He reiterates that she is sincerely

anti-Comunist, and that she does not share the beliefs of the

militant black racists, although she certainly is a convinced ad-

vocate of the civil lights struggle.

suggests that any

approach to ber must stress respect for her commitment to the civil

rights novement. This approach should emphasize that Commnist S

exploitation of the novement is in the interest of neither the nove

ment nor the nation and should request her collaboration in report-

Ing on foreign (and only foreign) attempts to exploit the situation.

As an alternative to this direct approach, we believe that consider-

ation should ba given to the desirability of merely stating that

becausether activity in the civil rights novement she has beep

thrown into contact with Vietnanese, Cubans, etc. of Interest to

VO?IRM and on whom we would welcone reports. This line has the

virtue of having less blor-back potential should our approach ba

declined and we would hope that once a relationship with her had

been established she would volunteer infommation on SNCC and its

foreion involvement.

Reinforcing the approach

she is now living

cial independence to write another book. However, she has done no

viting yet and is begiming to be concerned regarding her source

of incone when the grant expires at the end of the year.

- Time is of great importance in any approach to Identity A

view.. He stresses that she is beconing concerne

regarding future income and may soon begin withdrawing from SNCC

activities in order to begin writing. Mora importantly, her normal

instincts may soon lead to a falling out with Identity C and other

radicals who are active in SNCC. If this happens it can be expected

to severely reduce her access. Here she in contact with WOrIR™;

however. such arguents vith targat personalitles could be avoided

8. Than we are presented iith what appears to be an opportunity

to gain a collaborator who might be able to provide information of

the highest interest regarding Coumnist efforts to use SIC, and

who might be able to gain access to various other radical groups

at least abroad, seem to be virtually unapproachable and thus this

opportunity lay be alnost unique. At the name tine, there appears

to be a rather critical time factor operative here.

9. In addition, rather findamental questions are ratsed by

thoroughness of
