Memo, Sec. of State Herter to President Eisenhower

"the United States would immediately take political

action to remove Trujillo from the Dominican Republic

as soon

as a suitable successor can be induced to

take over with the assurance of U. S. political,

economic, and -- if necessary -- military support."

Memo, CIA to J. C. King

"c.

Would it provide a small number of sniper

rifles or other devices for the removal of key

Trujillo people from the scene?"

CIA memo

"Providing the arms as requested would contribute

significantly toward this

end."

CIA memo

"a.

Delivery of approximately 300 rifles and

pistols together with ammunition and a supply of

grenades,

to secure cache on the South shore of the

island,

about 14 miles east of Ciudad Trujillo.

PHOTOCOPY FROM THE GERALD R

"b.

Delivery, to the same cache described above,

of an electronic detonating device with remote

control features, which could be planted by the

dissidents in such manner as to eliminate certain

key Trujillo henchmen.

This might necessitate train.

ing

and introducing into the country by illegal entry o

a trained technician to set the bomb and detonator."

(Emphasis added)

Special Group Minutes

"the proposed actions would not, of themselves

bring

about the desired result in the near

future lacking some decisive stroke against Trujillo

himself."

LIBPARY

Special Group Minutes

"Mr. Merchant explained the feeling of the Depart-

ment of State that limited supplies of small arms

and other material should be made available for

dissidents inside the Dominican Republic. Mr. Parrott

said that we believe this can be managed securely by

CIA, and that the plan, would call for final trans-.

portation into the country being provided by the

dissidents themselves.

The Group approved the

project."

Memo, Mann to Merchant

"Opposition elements have consistently asked us to

supply them with "hardware" of various types. This

has included quantities of conventional arms and

also, rather persistently, they have asked for

some of the more exotic items and devices which

they associate with revolutationary effort."

Memo, Scott to Merchant

"agreed in terms of Tom Mann's memo"

Cable, Dearborn to Devine

"delighted" "exotic equipment."

CIA memo

"the key to the success of the plot Ito overthrow

the Trujillo regimel would be the assassination

of Trujillo."

CIA memo

"(a) Ex-FBI agents who would plan and execute

the death of Trujillo.

(b) Cameras

and other items that could be used

to fire projectiles.

(c) A chemical that could be rubbed on the palm

of one's hand and transferred to Trujillo in

a handshake, causing delayed lethal results.

(d) Silencers for rifles that could kill from a

distance of several miles. (Id.)"

CIA memo

". . . the members of our club are now prepared in

their minds to have a picnic but do not have the

ingredients for the salad.

Lately they have

developed a plan for the picnic, which just might

work if they could find the proper food.

They have

asked us for a few sandwiches, hardly more, and we

are not prepared to make them available.

Last week

we were asked to furnish three or four pineapples

for a party in the near future but I could remember

nothing in my instructions that would allow me to

contribute this ingredient.

Don't think I wasn't "

tempted.

I have rather specific guidelines to the

effect

that salad ingredients will be delivered

outside the picnic grounds and will be brought to

the

area

by another club."

"The DCI referred to recent reports of a new

anti-Trujillo plot. He said we never know if

one of these is going to work or not, and asked

Special Group Minutes

"Gen. Cabell [Deputy DCI] noted that the internal

dissidents were pressing for the release to them

of certain small arms now in U. S. hands in the

Dominican Republic.

He inquired whether the

feeling of the Special Group remained that these

arms should not be passed.

The members showed no

inclination to

take a contrary position at this

time."

(Emphasis supplied)

State Department Document, Select Committee No. 313

"1.

The USG should not lend itself to direct

political assassination.

2. US moral posture can ill afford further

tarnishing in the eyes of the world.

3.

We would be encouraging the action, supplying

the weapons, effecting the delivery, and then

turning over only the final execution to

(unskilled) local triggermen.

4.

So far we have seen no real evidence of action

capability.

Should we entrust ourselves and

our reputation to this extent in the absence

Can we afford a precedent which may convince

the world that our diplomatic pouches are

ment they can be assured that any reasonable request

for assistance from the U. S. will be promptly and

favorably answered."

we would like to send to Henry Dearborn, our Consul

General in Ciudad Trujillo, supplementing the

guidance he will be receiving on the recently
