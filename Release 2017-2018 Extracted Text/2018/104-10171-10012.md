vat ‘about 10300 P.M. on Sunday, 20 May, he and his family had
returned to their house, which is. located about three blocks from the
Parque Infantil INIT where the townfolk were dancing and celebrating
this-traditional date. Shortly after arriving, they heard gunfire
in the general direction of the beach, © This was described as mixed -

the other escapees: that there were no militia casaulties; that there
was no inkling that an infiltration operation had taken place prior

of propaganda’in Cuba, He recalled that the radio program with Juan
AMADOR Rodriguez on longwave at midday was popular and heard by many
of the townfolk. He remarked that they listen to a 5:00 AM and 12:00

Voice of America shortwave broadcasts were very effective in his
region. He never tuned in to Radio Las Americas and instantly associatpd
