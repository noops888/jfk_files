of family ties and sympathetic attitude toward student activities that

Needless to bny, however, this le a modest

declaration on his part since she type of aid he hod been lending with

out rescrvation is punishable by death or imprisonment for all or

any members of his immedlate fandly:

Subject related the erents of 20 May in his small beach

resort village as follows:

"At about 10:00 P.M. on Sunday, 20 May, he and his family had

returned to their house, which is located about three blocks from the

Parque Infantil ISIT where the townfolk were dancing and celebrating

this traditional date.

Shortly after arriving, they heard gunfire

in the general direction of the beach.

This was described as mixed

nutomatic fire and single shots.

There was much shouting and confusion

in the streets of the town near the park, and

AMHINT-40.*

"After recognition and eschange of explanations,

family were departing Cuba and had their home prepared

confirming their safe arrival.

They slept in his house that night and

departed early Monday morning for Havana."

precautions were made for travel in which the two-man team traveled

"Prior to departure Varadero, however,

had to visit the

Militia Post to turn over the keys to his house and process his de

parture.

During a forty-minute walt there,

he overheard conversatlong

among

the officers. From these conversations, it was apparent that

the Militia patrol encountering the beach operation reported the clash

as "escapees": that two or mor, were killed and the bodies taken with

the other escapees: that there vere no militia casaulties: that there

was no inkling that an infiltration operation had taken place prior

to the patrol encounter."

"When queried as to militia casualties since the DRE had reported

that at lenst tro had been

"dropped" on the beach, subject comnented

whole town would have known about it by norning."

was very vague and lacked details concerning his knowledge

of propaganda in Cuba.

He recalled that the radio program with Juan

AMADOR Rodiiguez on lougwave at midday was popular and heard by many

of the townfolk.

He remarked that they listen to a 5:00 AN and 12:00

noon shortwave program coming from Key lest, and finally, that the

Voice of America shortwave brosdcasts were very effective in his

region. He never tuned in to Radio Las Americas and instantly associated

it with the forser "Radio

Swan" repcating the usual hearsay that "it

was discredited".

He described a place known as loras Finns,"

located between Cardonas and Calisco (10 miles South) pointed out on

the map to be

about 22565-5118.

There is a Nilitin Post there with

bout 500 land 600 starloned there for short periods.. He observed some

tank movement, about sit to eight tanka trascling in and out of this

ared at a time, but could

not describe them as to type or size. He'

described the militia personnel in thie reglon as a

"Very low type"

of Cuban which was disgusting do the local countrg people and there

was continuous friction..

He commented that it was just such camps or

post. as this that turned the general population into oppositionists.

About 17 or 18 May, subject observed a large freighter unload-

ing cargo in Matanzas harbor.

The local people described it as Russian

and subject could not confirm or deny this.

The shipment was large,

and in various size crates that were trucked out of the dock

area in large convoys.

Near a village known as Palmillas (2238N-8045W) about 10 miles

Southeast of Colon,, Province

of Matanzas, subject reports that there.

are two guerrilla bands

of twelve to twenty men each.

During 15 to 17

these bands attasted farms occupied

by militia, killing one

militlaman and running the others off the farm. They burned the house,

destroyed the fare equiprent.

Again on the 18th of May,

one of these bands attacked another

militia post and killed one militia.

the reason for United States failure to take direct

in Cuba.

He said the people understand thnt

CASTRO is their own doing and that the United Stutes cannot be held

responsible for his presence.

He described the grenter part of the

populace as sick and tired,

undernourlshed, disgusted with blatant

propaganda lies, terrorized by

repression but ultimately disposed to

resist at all costs.

That 1f arms were generally available among the

populace,

especially rifles and ammunition for them,

CASTRO would have

been overthrown by now, althout a bit of outside help.

That the farmers

and some city folk,.

in desperation, leave their homes to join the
