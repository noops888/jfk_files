OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

1. This report will cover the period 30 July 1963 through
15 September 1963 and is a follow-up report to reference 4.

EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXFILTRATE AMLEO-3 FAMILY FHM CUBA

2. Since transmission of reference A to Headquarters soveral
developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternate
solutions to the problem of the AMLEO-3 family in Cuba. The
alternate solutions that. were eliminated, as found in paragraph
3 of reference A, were (a) "Maintain Status Quo as a Family
attempting Leave Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy as Part of the
American Repatriation Program"; (b) "Have AMLEO-3 Family
Withdraw Papers From the Swiss Embassy and American Repatriation
Program and Attempt Leave Cuba-as Normal Refugees via Mexico
Or Spain"; and (e) "Have the AMLEG3 Family Case Taken up With the
GOC Through the ‘Donovan’ Channel for Possible Legal Exfiltration".
Elimination of the above alternates left only two solutions
that were at all feasible; (c) "Have the AMLEO-3 Family Take
Asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mextan Embassies in Havana",
or (d)."Have the AMLEO-3 Family Exfiltrated black in o Maritime
Operation by either a KUBARK or Independent Maritime Team."
Because of the inherent risk involved in a black oxfiltration,
it was decided that the AMLEO-3 family should be put into
asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican embassies with all
possible speed.

7, jLater during the conversation AMTHUG-] asked .

Mrs. AMLEO<3 if her husband still had the presentation Soviet
pistol that he had given him in 1961, and Mra. AMLEO-3

informed him that her husband had taken it with him when he
defected and asked ANTHUG-1 if he wanted it returned to him,
ANTHUG-1 did not reply to the question. Later on, while
discussing her conversation with AMTHUG-1 with Identity B,
Identity B suggested to Mre, AMLEO-3 that she request AMLEO-3
to send the pistol back to AMTHUG-1 via Ambassador LECHUGA

at the United Hations, NYC. Identity B added that the return
of the pistol might help matters since the loss of the pistol had
been one of the things that bothered AMTHUG-1 most when

AMLEO-3 defected. (i.e. AMLEO-3 has noted that these special
presentation Soviet pistols were given by AMTHUG-1 to probably
less. than ten people in Cuba, and their presentation had a very
special meaning for AMTHUG-1 since the recipients were supposed
to be his very personal and close friends. AMLEO-3 clains

that not even AMLOUT-1 had received one of these special
presentation pistols from AMTHUG-1.) Consideration is being
given to AMTHUG-1's request, if it would assist Hrs. AMLEO-3
in. her efforts to leave Cuba, but for the time being the pistol
will be held by KUBARK.

8... AMTHUG-1 also told Mrs. AMLEOQ-3 that her husband had
teien a light plane when he fled and implied (although she
does not so state directly) that he would like to see it
returned, The balance of ire. AMLEO-3's letter concerned her
desire to leave Cuba, mentioned the necessity for almness by both
she and her husband with no rach actions, and without giving
any additional facts stated that her conversation with AMTHUG-1
fad been a long one but that she could not get him to make
any promises re her departure, ;

DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONAL LEADS TO DISRFFECTED CUBANS

9. During the operational period one of AMLEO-3's
operational leads, whom he had written a report on for the
AMTRUNK PM operation, was recruited via the recently successful
AMTRUNK infiltration operation and given the crypt of AMTRUNK~10./}
AMLEO-3 also screened additional AMTRUNK leads and KUTUBE
military leads during the period and was abie to submit
reports on some four individuals for these operations. All such
leads were fed to him mixed in with many other Cuban names.
AMLEO-3 is presently preparing reports on PHS target studies
Major Felipe | GUERRA Matos and Hajor Jorge SEGUERA, Cuban .
Ambasaador to Algeria.

10, AMLEO-3 also assisted in the handling of AMLEO-5's

wife during the period when she established direct telephonic
communication with her husband in Cuba, and tried to cdémvince
him that she wanted to return to Cuba with her children,
but stipulated to A-5 that he would have to meet her in a third
country first and resolve their personal family problems.
AMLEO=3 baby sat for the wife during these calls, since we
only knew. what day the calls would be coming in and never the
hour, He also assisted Mrs, AMLEO-5 in recording the last telephone
conversation she had with her husband. In this same operation ,
AMLEO-3 also assisted the Case Officer in the conversations i
held with the mother of AMLEO-5 while she was in the United i
States, although he was. never allowed to establish direct 4
contact with the mother, We had hoped that the mother of \
‘AULEO-5 would attempt to establiah contact onher own with
AMLEO-3, but to WAVE Station knowledge she never attempted to dco

- go, If she had, we would have allowed AMLEO-3 to respond to her
contact efforta (maintaining his cover as being disassociated
with ODYOKE).

3, To this end steps were initiated in on 24 July 1963.

to put tie AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum in the Mexican
Embassy in Havana, The AMLEQ-3 family and AMLEO-2 were advised

via the AWMEH=3 OWVL channel on 4 August 1963 to prepare

themselves for asylum and to avait further orders via the same
channel. KUBARK Station in Kexico City, meanwhile, took urgent
action through its Mexican $M@iisan channels to have the Mexican
Foreign Ministry obtain visas for the AMLEO-3 family and

AMLEO-2; ond then send word to the Mexican Embassy in Havana,

Cuba that the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 should be granted asylum
when they appeared at the Mexican Consulate under cover of

obtaining their visas. The visa portion of the operation was
antisfactorily completed and notification of same was sent into

the Mexican Embassy in Havana; but word re asylum for the \
AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 was not sent to the Mexican embassy \
due to insecure commo channels and lack of trusted couriers, and '
to date no secure method has yet been found to notify the Mexican {
Embassy in Havana that asylum should be granted to tho AMLEOs.

via OWL on-11 September requesting he detemine whether or not
Identity A’would be willing to act as intermediary to receive
the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum at a specific tine
and date at the Mexican consulate. AMWEB=2 asked for |
clarification on the manner of approaching Identity A on the case
on 13 September via pouch, and more detailed guidance on the
matter was sent to him via OWVL on 14 September, A final reply
re possibilities for action via this channel is expected from
momentarily. If the SHWEE=1 reply is favorable, then
he will be told to arrange the meeting at the Mexican consulate
between the AMLEOs and Identity A so that they can be taken into
asylum by tho Mexicans.

4. As a’result of the above, word was sent to @MWEEED~ |
|

5. As noted in reference B, if the AMMREED report is a
negative one, then consideration will be given to having the
AMLEOs take asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy in Havana, The
test case utilizing AMCANOE~3, mentioned in paragraph 5 A of
reference B, is to be attempted on or about 21 August 1963, and
if this attempt at asylum is successful then arrangements will
be made to have the ANLEOs enter the Uruguayan Embassy in the
same manner.

6, As noted in paragraph 1 of reference B, the wife
of AMLEO-3 finally made a direct contact with AMTHUG-1 on 7
September 1963, while he was at his Santa Maria beach house,
and appealed too him for permission to leave Cuba with her
childrei and rejoin her husband AMLEO-3 in the United States.
On 14 September 1963 AMLEO-3 received a letter from his wife
giving more details on the above mecting, The wife of AMLEO-3
had been visiting the beach home of a family friend, situated
next to that of AMTHUG-1 on Santa Maria beach, on a daily basis
hoping to see AMTHUG-1. Finally, on 7 September 1963, she saw
him swimming alone in the ocean and promptly went into the water, |
introduced herself , and requested prmission to talk to hin.

1 granted this permission, and during their conversation
ANTHUG-1 made it clear he would not grant Mrs. AMLEO-3 permission
to depart Cuba at ‘this time, stating that the tinc was not
propitious due to the attacks and raids being carried out
against Cuba, and that Mrs, AMLEO-3 would just have to wait.

Mrs, AMLEO-3’then told him she did not soo why he was holding her pf
and her children responsible for what her husband did; that she Ng
feared her husband might forget her and their children completely

Af the separation continued, and that if AMLEO-3 was left much
longer alone he would find a woman to replace her, ANTHUG-1_
replied by asking her "Do you consider yourself a burden to y6ur |
husband?" The wife replied "It is possible", and ANTHUG-1 then
asked "But he calls you every day.”

code phrases for individuals) indicating that Identity B

has continued to be very helpful to her by supplying 5
her with binckmarket food, loaning her her automobile, cnd other-
wise assisting her with her problems. Identity B may be
carrying out such actions on a genuine friendship basis,

(she has even been denounced by the neighborhood defense
committee "ag assisting gusanos") or she may be buying insurance
for the future, The possibility also exists that she is reaaining
a confidant of Mrs. AMLEO-3 on orders of AMTHUG-1 and is
reporting on all developments to AMTHUG-1. In early September
1963 Raul PRIMRLLES (201-327902) arrived at Identity B's

home for a visit while Mra. AMLEQ-3 was present. Mr and Mrs.
PRIMELLES ignored the presence of Mra. A-3 and did not speak

to herewhile greeting Identity B. Because of this Identity B
promptly turned her back on her visitors and did not answer

them, continuing her conversation with Mrs, AMLEO-3, lr. and
Mrs. PRIMSLLES were thrown into some confusion by this reception
and departed from the arer,

12. Mrs. AMLEQ-3 has also mentioned that GMSNAFU-12
was most kind to her during her recent home leave in Cuba,
and made it quite clear she was anxious to get in touch with
AMLEO-3, During the latter part of August Mrs. A-3 again
mentioned to her husband that GWSNAFU-12 had written Identity
B from Paris stating she was surprised at not having heard

from-AMLEO-3. —
ATTITUDE, MORALE, AND PERFORMANCE OF AMLEO-3 Cc

13, During the reporting period AMLEO-3 has consistently

towards his work. During the latter part of Agust 1963 AMLEO-3
began to lose his patience with the slow progress in getting

his wife into asylum, and began requesting permission to return
to Cuba himself in order to exfiltrate his wife black, AMLEO-3
became quite demanding in this regard and claimed that KUBARK's
time had run out, and since he had waited patiently for nino
months he now felt it was his turn to try his luck. AMNLEO-3

is extremely confident of his own ability in action situations
and operations and extensive argumentation was necded to
persuade him that such a course of action would be suicidal

for his wife and children and that his wisest course of action
would be to give us additional time to bring the asylum operation
to a successful conclusion, Because of AMLEOQ-3's faith in
higher authority, COS JMWAVE, Andrew KB, REUTKMAN visited AMLEO-2
on 8 September 1963 for the purpose of convincing him that any ¢
unilateral action on his part would only be counterproductive
and playing right into AMTHUG-l's hands. KUBARK's limited
commitments to AMLEO-3 were also reviewed along with the history
of our actions to help his wife and children leave Cuba legalay.
After some frank exchanges of facts AMLEO-3 was finally convinced
that the only productive course of action left to him was to
continue to sweat out the asylum proposition and hope for the
best. Absolutely no further commitments were made to AMLIO-3
during these discussions and alternate courses of action if

the asylum attempts fail were not discussed but instead left in
abeyance.

In regard to points a and b in paragraph 2 of reference C,
the _KURIOT representative in WAVE Station states that the Florida
drivers license issued to Joseph A, Reese is a valid, backstopped
drivers license for actual use by the Subject and the address
a legitimate safehouse with backstopped rental cover. Subject's
cover story was that he recently moved to the Miami area from
New Orleans, Louisiana (which city the Subject lived m for
several years and has relatives residing there). The Subjct's

costs

16. AMLEO-3 continues to receive a flat salary of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per month, and also is paid approximately
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for purchase of foodstuffs
Since he is encouraged to eat his meals in the KUBARK
gsafehouse and stay out of public places. We have also continued
to pay the wife of AMLEO-5 the amount of one hundred and twenty five
dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance for herself and her
two children to supplement the $120.00 per month she receives
from the Cuban Refugee Center, The C/O has continued his efforts

- to find part-time employment for Mra. AMLEO-5 so that KUBARK
“could be relieved Gf the necessity to support her, but to date
we have been unsuccessful in our efforts primarily because Mrs.
AMLEO=5 has never worked in her life and has no work skills
whatsoever. No other financial expenditures of note were made
duribg the period, and no financial assistance is presently
contemplated for any other AMLEOs.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

17. During the reporting period no positive intelligence
reports were disseminated by the AMLEO group since none of the
active agents are located in the target area, nor do they
circulate in Cuban exile circles.

18, We are continuing to utilize AMLEO-3 as @ consultant
on the MHAPRON program, and to this end are planning to have
hin expand his reporting of personality information on selected
individuals and to utilize him to explain interconnections
between various individuals and groups as they take shape i
MHAPRON research,
