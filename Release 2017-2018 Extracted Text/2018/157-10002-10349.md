From: Bill ae

Date: May 8, 1975 ~
Subj: Request for Studies from the CIA Historical
Offices -- the May 8 Washington Post article.

In today's Washington Post there is a story concerning
the Committee's requests for documentation, which includes
the charge that the staff, in asking for studies from the
cIA historical office, had "asked only for reports of opera-
tions that originated in either the Eisenhower or Nixon
administrations." This is clearly and demonstrably not
the case. I attach a copy of the 15 studies we put on our

@ priority list. Furthermore, using a rough breakdown into
categories of the some 50 studies we have requested. shows
the following pattern: o
(1) Studies dealing with the Kennedy/Johnson era -- il
(2) Studies dealing with the Eisenhower/Nixon period - 4

(3) Studies covering the period roughly 1950 through
1965 ----18

(4) Histories prior to 1952 -- 4
(5) Organizational histories (Office of Training,etc.)10

(6) No dates given on the study - 1
