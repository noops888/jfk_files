2. According toa Bender source (AMCLATTER-1) who talked

5. AMCLATTER-1 also reported that, Tony Varona said he wi

6 AMCLATTER-1 commented that when Rasco found out about
6 ‘proposed trip he.called the. MDC representative, name unknown,
York.and 'told"him-to see. that the movement was stopped since
it.-was not-FRD-sponsored, Eduardo Gonzales called Varona to:try to,.
get the MDC representative to lay off, which Tony did, assuring Rasco
that this was his own personal operation.

7..- Mr, Stanulis suggested that Mr, Barnes should make it quite
clear in any conversations at the White House that wo seriously doubt
that at this etage Varona or anyone else can exert very much control
if the delegation comes to Washington, ‘Thia seems obvious, since’ b
now not only does it asem that several groups in addition to Varona'é,
wore initially involved in the organization of the cavalcade but others

may well try to got into the act.

8, We havé been prorhiséd through the-Béndor channel more
precise information on when the cavalcade will arrive but given the
somewhat confused picture one cannot count on receiving advance

word,
