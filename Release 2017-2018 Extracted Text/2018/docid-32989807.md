Senator Tower. What criteria do you use in the selection

of informants?

Mr. Wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. fin |

our cases relating to extremist matters, surely inorder to get
an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged in a
criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set
of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist
principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating
in the same area, and in various established sources such as
local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type
who has credibility, can be depended upon to be reliable, we
would interview the individual in order to make a determination
as to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI
in discharging its responsibilities in. that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we
would conduct a rather in depth investigation for. the. purpose
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator. Tower. .How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between
the. use of informants for law enforcement as opposed to
intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best adel
the use of informants on criminal matters sincé he is over
the operational division on that.

Mr. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the fact
that a criminal, informant in a law enforcement ‘function, you
are trying to develop evidencé which will be admissible in
court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant
alone, your purpose could either be prosecution or it could be
just for purposes of pure intelligence.

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality
of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,
through ee of the informant, obtain evidence which could be
used independently of the testimony of the informant so that
he can continue operating as a criminal informant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to
function as provocateurs?

Mr. Adams, No, sir, they're not. We have strict regula-
tions against using informants as provocateurs. This gets
into that delicate area of entrapment which has been addressed
by the courts on many occasions and has been concluded by the
courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage j
in an activity, the government has the right to provide him the |
opportunity. This does not mean, of course, that mistakes don't
occur in this area, but we take whatever steps we can to

avoid this, Even the law has recognized that informants can

especially the Supreme Court in the Newark County Case, that:
the very difficulty of penetrating an ongoing operation, that

ah informant himself cah engage in.criminal activity, but

because there is lacking this criminal intent to violate a
law, we stay away from that. Our regulations fall short of that.

If we have a’ situation where we felt that an informant

or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United

States Attorney or to the Attorney General to try to make sure

we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our
iiformants.

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do
instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that
they are informing on, do you not?

Mr. Adams. We did when we had the COINTELPRO programs,
which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably
one of the best’ examples of a situation where’ the'law was:
in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used
much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little
Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending
in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law
enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the
troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

to preserve the respective roles in law enforcerient. You have
historical problems with the ‘Klan coming along. We had
situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost
powerless to act. We ‘had local law enforcement officers in
“some areas participating in Klan violence.

The instances mentioned by Mr. Rowe, every one of those,
he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't
see what action.was taken with that information, as he pointed
out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance. We
also knew that in certain instances the information, upon being
received, was not being acted upon. We also disseminated
simultaneously through letterhead eH nea to the Department
of Justice the problem, and here, here we were, the FBI, ina
position where we had no authority in the absence of instruction
from, the Department of Justice, to make an arrest. ,

Sections 241 and 242 don't cover it because you don't have
evidence of a conspiracy, and it ultimately resulted in
a situation where the Department called in United States
Marshals who do have authority similar to local law enforcement
officials. ;

’ So, historically, in those days, we were just as frus-
trated as anyone else was, and when we got information. from
someone like Mr. Rowe, good information, reliable information,

and it was passed on to those who had the responsibility to

do something about it, it was not always acted upon, as he
indicated, : ;

Senator Tower. None of these cases, then, there was
adequate evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to
act? a

Mr. Adams. The Departmental plies at that time, and still
require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.
Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together, . you
can have a mob scene, and you can have blacks and whites
belting each other, but unless you can show that those that
initiated the action acted in concert in a conspiracy, you have.
no violation.

Congress recognized this, and-it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the civil rights
statute, which added punitive measures against an individual
that didn't have to be a conspiracy. But this was a problem
that the whole country was grappling with: the President of
the United States, Attorney General. We were ina situation
where we had rank lawlessness taking place, as you know from
a omoeanaum we sent you that we sent to the Attorney General.
The accomplishments we were able to obtain in preventing
violence, and in neutralizing the Klan ~- and that was one.
of the reasons.
Senator Tower. What was the Bureau's purpose in con-

tinuing or urging the continued surveillance of the Vietnam

Veterans Against the War?

Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the
intent to halter political expression?

Mr. Adams, We had information on the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War that indicated that there were subversive
groups involved. They were going to North Vietnam and meeting.
with the Communist forces. They were going to Paris, attending
meetings paid for and sponsored by the Communist Party, the
International Communist Party. We feel that we-had a very valid
basis to direct our attention to the VVAW.

It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was
head of the Communist Party, USA, and the comments he made,

and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it
split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost
group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point
factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and they closed
those chapters because there was no longer any intent to follow|
the national organization.

But we had a valid basis for investigating it, and we
‘\nvestigatea chapters to determine if there was affiliation
and subservience to the national office. ;

Senator Tower. Mr. Hart?

Senator Hart of Michigan. But in the process of chasing
after the Veterans Against the War, you got a ‘et of information

that clearly has no relationship to any Federal ‘criminal

Mr. Adams. Tf agree, Senator.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Why. don't you try to shut that
stuff off. by simply telling the ‘agent, or pate informant?

Pe Adams; Here is thé! problem that ‘you have with that. i
When you're looking’ at an organization, do you report only the
violent statements made by the group or do you also show that
you may have one or two violent individuals, but you have
some of these church groups that were mentioned, and others,
that the whole intent of the group is not in violation of the
statutes, You have to report the good, the favorable along
with the unfavorable, and this is a problem. We wind up with
information in our files. We are accused of being vacuum
cleaners, and you are a vacuum cleaner.’ If you want to know the
real purpose of an organization, do you only report the
violent statements made and the fact that it is by a small
minority, ox do you also-show the broad base of the organization
and what it really is?

And within that ‘is where we have to have the guidelines

we recognize that we do wind up with too much information in
our files. i

Senator Hart of Michigan. But in that vacuuming process,
you are feeding into Departmental files the names of people

Senator Hart of Michigan. this is what should require
us to rethink this whole business. ‘

Mr. Adams. Absolutely.

And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well
as the congressional input sr going to address themselves to.

Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked about a wide Pe
of SEoupa which the Bureau can and has had informant penetration
and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's definition
of when an extremist or security investigation-:may be under-
taken refers to groups whose activity either involves Violation
of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation
of such law, and when such an investigation is opened, then’
informants may be used.

Another guideline says that domestic intelligence
investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations.
The agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation
relevant to 7 potential violation. Even now, with an improved,
upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back
again in a world of possible violations or activities which
may result in illegal acts.

Now, any constitutionally protected exercise of the
right to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest, to petition,
conceivably may result in viclonee or disrupticn of a lecal
town meeting, when a controversial social issue might result

in disruption. It might be by hecklers rather than those holdin

Does this mean that the Bureau should investigate all

groups organizing or participating in such a meeting because

Me. Adams. No, sir.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Isn't that how you justify
spying on almost every aspect ofthe peace movement?

Mr. Adams. No, Sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we i
monitor demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored ‘by a group that we have an
investigative interest in, a valid investigative intérest in,
or where members of one of these groups are participating where}
there is a potential that they might change the peaceful
nature of the demonstration.

But this is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing on the
Pirst amendment rights of people, yet at the same time being
aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers in the.
past than we do at the present time, But we have had periods
where the demonstrations have been rather severe, and the
courts have said that the FBI has‘a right, and indeed a duty,
to keep itself informed with respect i the possible commission
of crime. It is not obliged to wear blinders until it may be
too late for prevention.

And that's a good statement if applied in a clearcut

Senator Hart of Michigan. Let's assume that the a
for opening an investigation on a group is narrowly drawn. ‘The
Bureau manual states that ‘informants investigating a subversive
organization should hot ohly réport on what that group is
doing but should look at and report on activities in which:
the group is participating.

There is: a Section 87B3 dealing with reporting. on
connections with other groups. That section says that the
field office shall -"determine and report on any, significant
connection or cooperation with non-subversive groups." ‘Any
significant connection or cooperation with non-subversive
groups.

Now let's look at this in practice. In the spring of
1969 there was a rather heated national debate over the
installation of the anti-ballistic missile system. Some of us
remember that. ‘An FBI informant and two FBI confidential
Boures reported on the plan's participants and activities |
of the aehangton Area Citizens Coalition Against the ABM,
particularly in open public debate in’a high ‘school auditorium,
which included speakers from the Defense Department for the
ABM and a scientist and defense analyst against the ABM.

The informants reported on the planning for the meeting,
participation by local clergy, plans to seek resolution on i»

ABM from nearby town councils. There was also informat’:. on

Plans for the meeting and apparently atténded and reported on

the conference. The Bureau's: own reports described the

participants as having, represented diverse’ perspectives -on

the issue of amnesty, including civil Liberties and human
rights groups, Gut. rights spokesmen, parents of.men killed
in Vietnam, wives of ex-patriates in Canada, experts on draft
counselling, religious groups interested in peace issues,

delegates from student organizations, and aides of House and

. Senate inembers, drafting legislation on amnesty.

The informant apparently was attending in his role as
a member of a group under investigation as allegedly subversive
and it described the topics of the workshop.

Ironically, the Bureau office report before them noted
that in view of the location of the conference at a theological
seminary, the FBI would use restraint and limit: its coverage aa
to informant reports.

Now this isn't five or ten years ago. This is last
fall.: And this is‘a conference of people who have the point

Mr. Adams. I'll let Mr. Wannall address himself to this.

‘He is particular knowledgeable as to this operation.

Mr. Wannall. Sénator Hart, that was a case that was
opened on November 14. and closed November 20, and the informati

which caused us to be interested in it were really.two particul

items. One was that’ a member of the steering committee there

was a three man steering committee, and oné of those members
of the national conference was in fact a national officer
of the VVAW in whom we had suggested before we did have a

legitimate investigative interest,

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I would almost say so whht

at that point.
Mr. Wannall. The second report we had was that the
VVAW would actively participate in an attempt to pack the
conference to take it over. And the third report we had -~
Senator Hart of Michigan. And incidentally, all of the
information that your Buffalo informant had given you with
respect to the goals and aims of the VVAW gave you i list of
goals which were completely within Constitutionally protected
objectives. There wasn't a single item out of that VVAW that
jeopardizes the .security of this country at all.
: Mr. Wannall. Well, of-course, we did not rély entixely

on the Buffalo informant, but even ‘there we did. reces*-

from that informant information which I considered to be
significant.

The Buffalo chapter of the VVAW was the regional office .
covering New York and northern New Jersey. It was one ‘of the
five most active VVAW chapters’ in the country and ata
national conference, or at the regional conference, this
informant reported information back to us that an attendee
at the conference announced that he had run guns into Cuba
prior to the Castro take-over. He himself said that he during

the Cuban crisis had been under 24 hour suveillance. There

-was also discussion at the conference of subjugating the

VVAW to the revolutionary union. There were some individuals
in the chapter or the regional conference who were not in

agreement with us, but Mr. Adams has addressed himself to the

. interest of the revolutionary union.

So all of the information that we had on the vvaw did
not come from that source but even that particular source did
vive us information which we considered to be of some
significance in our appraisal of the need for continuing the
investigation of that particular chapter of the VAN.

Senator Hart of Michigan. _ But does it give you the
right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even
if it is a conference that might be taken over by the VVAW
when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we

seek to achieve unconditional’ amnesty? What threat?

Mr. Wannall. Our interest, of course, was the vvAW

Senator Hart of Michigan. Would the same logic follow?

Mr. Wannall. I think that if we found that if, the
Communist Party USA was going ‘to takeover the meeting and
use it as a front for its own purposes, there would be a logic.
in doing that. You have a whole’ scope here “ana it's a matter.

In fact, only one individual attended and reported to us,
and that was .the person who had, who was not developed for
this reason; an informant who had been reporting on other

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, my time has expired
but even this brief exchange, I think, indicates that if we
really want to control the dangers to our society of using
informants to dathen domestic political intelligence, we have
to restrict, sharply domestic intelligence investigations, And
that gets us into what I would like to raise with you when
my turn comes around again, and that's the use of warrants,
obliging the Bureau to obtain a warrant before’a full-fledged
informant can be directed by the Bureau against a group or
individuals.

I know you have objections to that and I would like to
review that: with you.

Senator Mondale, pursue that question.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an
obligation to obtain a warrant before you turn jloose a full-
fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run
into you ox you run into, or who walk in as information sources
whe Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the

Committee. The Bureau argues that such a warrant requirement

Amendment rights of FBI informants ta communicate with their

But why would that. vary, why would a warrant requirement
raise a serious constitutional question?

Mr. Adams. Well, for one thing it's the practicability

of it ov ‘thé inpacticability ‘of‘getting a warrant’ which:
ordinarily involves probable ‘cause “to: show that a crime has
been or is about to be committed.

In the intelligence field we are ioe dealing necessarily
with an imminent criminal action. We're dealing with activities
such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have
discussed before, where they say publicly we're not. to engage
‘in any violent activity today, but we guarantee you we still
subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time
is ripe, we're going to rise up and help overthrow the United
States.

Well, now, you can't show probable cause if they're about
to do it because they're telling you they're nok going to do it
and you know they're not going to do it at this particular
moment.

It's just: the mixture somewhat of trying to mix ina
criminal procedure with an intelligence gathering function, and
we can't find any practical way of doing it. We have a particular
organization. We may have an informant that not only belongs
to the Communist Party, but belongs to several other organization:

and as part of his function he may be sent out by the Communist

Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.

It's just from our standpoint the possibility of informants,
the Supreme Court has held ‘that informants per se do not
violate the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendments. They have
recognized the eral ‘that the government has to have
individuals who will assist them in carrying out their
governmental duties.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I'm not sure I've heard anything
yet in response to the constitutional question, the very
practical question that you addressed.

Quickly, you are right that the court has said that the
use of the informant per se is not a violation of Shniafbeniniisitiies
rights of the subject under investigation. But Congress
can prescribe some safeguards, some rules and some standards,

just as we have with respect to your use of electronic

Senator Tower. Senator Schweiker.

Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much,

Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential
security informant and a security informant? :

Mr. Wannall, I mentioned earlier, Senator Schweiker,

‘that in developing an informant we do a preliminary check on

him before talking with him and then we do a further in-depth
background check.

A potential security informant is someone who is under
consideration before he is approved by headquarters for use as’

:
an informant. He is someone who is under current consideration.

activities to furnish the information to ‘the “local police, =
who had an obligation to, act. We furnished it to the beparttlien
of Justice.

In those areas where the local police did not act, it.
resulted finally in the Attorney General sending 500 United
States marshalls down to guarantee the safety of people who
were trying to march in protest of theiz civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came ata
time of civil righs versus federal rights, and yet there was
a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the country.

This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement agencies
_in itself at the time either because many of them aia act
upon the information that was furnished to them. But we
have no authority to make an arrest on the spot because we
would not have had evidence that there was a-conspiracy
available. We can do absolutely nothing in that regard.

In Little Rock, the decision was made, for instance, that

Senator Schweiker, “What would be wrong, just following

up your point there, Mr..Adams, with setting up a program

since it's obvious-to me that a lot of informers are going to
have pre-knowledge of.violence of using U.S. marshalls on some
kind of a long-range basis to. prevent violence?

Mr. Adams. We do. We have them in Boston in connection
with the busing incident. We are investigating the violations
under the ‘Civil Rights Act. But the marshalls are in Boston,
they are in Louisville, I believe at the same time, and this
is the approach, that the Federal government finally recognized
was the solution to the problem where you had to have added
Federal import.

Mr. Adams, Well, fortunately, we "re atua tine where

and the '70s and periods -+ or '50s and "608.3 We.report to ‘the |
Department of Justice on potential troublespots around the :
country as we learn of them so that the Department will be
aware of them. the planning for'Boston, for instance, took
place a year in advance with Seite officials, city officials,
the Department of Justice and the FBI sitting.down together
saying, how are we going to protect the situation in Boston?

I think we've learned a lot from the days back in ‘the
early '60s., But the government had no mechanics which protected
people at that time.

Senator Schweiker. I'd like to go, if I may, to the
Robert: Hardy case. I know he- is not a witness but he
was a witness before the House. But since this affects my
state, I'd like to ask Mr. Wannall. Mr. Hardy, of course, was

the FBI informer who ultimately led and planned and organized

a raid on the Camden draft board. An! according to Mr. Hardy's

that they had all the information they needed to clamp down

on the conspiracy and could arrest people at that point in time,

and yet no arrests were made.

Why, Mr. Wannall, was this true?

Mr. Wannall. Well, I can answer that based only on ‘the
material that I have reviewed, Senator Schweiker. It: was not
a case handled in my division but I think I can answer your
question.

There was, in fact, a representative of the Department
of Justice on the spot counselling and advising continuously
as that case progressed as to what spoint fhe eecese should be
made and we were being guided by ‘those to our mentors, the
ones who are responsible for making decisions of that sort..

So I. think that Mr. Iardy's statement to the effect that
there was someone in the Department there is perfectly true.

Senator Schweiker, That responsibility rests with who
under your procedures?

Mr. Wannall. We investigate decisions on making arrests,
when they should be made, and decisions with regard to
prosecutions are made either. by the United States attorneys
lor by Federals in the Department.

Mr. Adams. At this time that particular case did have

ae in the commission of the crime as further proof,
rather than relying on. one informant and some circumstantial
evidence to prove the violation.

Senator Schweiker. Well,.in this case, though, they
even had a dry run. : They could have arrested them on the
dry run. ;

that's getting pretty Close to conspiracy, it seems to
me. “They had a dry run and they could have arrested them on
the dry run.

I'd like to know why they didn't arrest them on the dry
run. Who was this Department of Justice official who made
that decision?

Mr. Adams. Guy Goodwin was the Department official.

Senator Schweiker. Next I'd like to ask back in 1965,
during the height of the effort to destroy the Klan, as you
put it a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released
figures that we had ‘something like 2,000 informers of some
kind or another infiltrating the’ Klan out of roughly 10,000
estimated membership.

I believe these are either FBI figures or estimates.
That would mean that one out of every five members of the Klan
at that point was an informant paid by the government.

And I believe the figure goes ene indicate that 70
percent of the new members of ‘the Kla:. that year were FBI

informants. !

For example, today we supposedly have only 1594 ‘total:

Mr. Adams. Well, this number 2,000 did include all

number of Klan informants in relation to Klan members was aroun
6 percent, I think, after we had read some of the: testimony.
Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan had a
group called the Action Group. ‘This was the group that you
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony, that he was left af-
ter the meeting. He attended the open meetings and heard
all of the hurrahs and this type of thing from information,
but he never knew what was going on because each one had an

Senator Schweiker. _ acknowledge that.

Mr. Adams. our only approach was through informants
and through-the use of informants we solved these cases, the
ones that were solved. Some of the bombing cases we have
never solved, They are extremely difficult. ”

These informants, as we told the Attorney General, and
as we told the President, that we had moved informants like
Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the bodyguard to the
head man. He was in a position where he could forewarn us
of violence, could help us on cases that had transpired, and
yet we knew and conceived that this could continue forever
unless we can create enough disruption that these members will
realize that if I go out and murder three civil rights workers,
even though the sheriff and other law enforcement officers are
in on it, if that were the case and with some of them it was
the case, that I would be caught. And that's what we did and
that's why violence stopped, was because the Klan was insecure
and just like you say, 20 percent, they thought 50 percent of
their members ultimately were Klan members and they didn't

dare engage in these acts of violence because they knew they

couldn't control the conspiracy any longer.

in the field of political ideas, it has bungled its job, it
has interfered with the civil liberties, and finally, in the
last month or two, through its public disclosures, heaped
shame upon itself and really led toward an undermining of

the crucial public confidence in’ an essential: law enforcement
agency of this country.

In a real sense, history has repeated itself because it
was precisely that problem that led to the creation of the FBI

In World War I, the Bureau of Investigation strayed from
its law enforcement functions and became an arbiter and
protector of political ideas. And through the interference
of civil liberties and Palmer Raids and’ the vest, the public

became so offended that later through Mr. Justice Stone and-

get involved in political ideas.

Mr. Adams. That's right, but how do you find out which
of the 20/000 Bund members might have been a saboteur, You
don't have probable cause to investigate anyone, but you can
direct an intelligence operation against the German-American
Bund , the same thing we did after Congress said --

Senator Mondale. Couldn't you get a warrant for that?
Why did you object to'going to court for authority for that?

Mr. Adams. Because we don't have probable cause to
go against an individual and the law doesn't provide for
probable cause to investigate an organization.

There were activities which did take place, like one time
they outlined the Communist Party -- ,

Senator Mondale, What I don't understand is why it

wouldn't be better for the FBI for us to define authority

that you could use in the kind of Bonn situation where under
court authority you can investigate where there is probable
cause or reasonable cause to suspect sabotage and the rest.

in this area. But I won't agree with you, Senator, that we'
have bungled the intelligence operations in the United States.
I agree with you that we have made some mistakes. Mr. Kelley.
has set a pattern of being as forthright as any Director of the
FBI in acknowledging mistakes that. had been made, but I think
that as you said, and I believe Senator Tower said, and
Senator Church, that we have to watch these hearings because
of the necessity that we mast concentrate on these areas of
abuse. We must not lose sight of the

overall law enforcement and intelligence community, and I
still feel that this is the freest country in the world.

I've travelled much, as I'm sure you have, and I know we have

are by the fact that there are 20,000 murders a year in the

Senator Mondale. I don't want to argue over terms, but
I think I sense an agreement that the FBI has gotten into trouble
over it in the political idea trouble, and that that's where we
need to have new legal standards.

Mr. Adams. yes, I agreé with that.

Senator Tower. Senator Huddleston.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr, Adams, these two instances we have studied at: some
length seems to have been an inclination on the part of
the Bureau to establish, a notion about an individual or a group
which seems to be very hard to ever change or dislodge. In
the case of Dr. King, where the supposition was that he was
being influenced by Communist individuals, extensive investi-~
gation was made, surveillance, reports came back indicating thak
this in fact was untrue, and directions continued to go out
to intensify the investigation. There never seemed to be a
willingness on the part of the Bureau to accept its own facts.

Ms. Cook testified this morning that something similar
to that happened with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, that
every piece of information that she supplied to the Bureau
seemed to indicate that the Bureau was. not correct in its
assumption that this organization planned to commit violence,
or that it was being manipulated, and yet you seemed to insist

« :
that this investigation go on, and t!..s information was used

against the individuals.

Now, are there instances where the Bureau has admitted that

its first assumptions were wrong and they have changed their

|, course?

Mr. Adams. We have admitted that. We have also shown
from one of the cases that Sénator Hart brought up, that after
five days we closed the case. We were told something by an
individual that there was a concern of an adverse influence
in it, and we looked into it. On the Martin Luther King
situation there was no testimony to the effect that we just
dragged on and on, or admitted that we dragged cA and on and
on, ad infinitum. The wiretaps on Martin Luther King were
all approved by the attorney General. Microphones on Martin
Luther King were approved by another Attorney General. This
wasn't the FBI, and the reason they were approved was that
there aera basis to continue the investigation up to a point.

What I testified to was that we were improper in discredit
Dr. King, but it's just like -- i

Senator Huddleston. The committee has before it memoranda
written by high officials of the Bureau indicating that the
information they were receiving from the field, oon these
surveillance methods, did not confirm what their supposition
was.

But the young lady,appearing this morning making the

the investigation. They don't agree with these principles

Senator Huddleston. That report was the basis of your

information against members who certainly had not been involved
in violence, and apparently to get them fired from their job

Mr. Adams. rt all gets back to the fact that even in the
criminal law field, you have to detect crime, and you have to

prevent crime, and you can't wait un something happens. . The

Attorney General has clearly spoken :: that area, and even our

statutory jurisdiction. provides that we don't --

crime, when you had information that it uae going to occur.

Mr. Adams. We disseminated every single item which he
reported to us.

Senator Huddleston. To a police department which you
knew was an accomplice to the crime. :

Mr. Adams. Not necessarily.

Senator Huddleston. Your informant had told you that,
hadn't he?

Mr. Adams. Well, the informant is on one level. We have
other informants, and we have other information.

Senator Huddleston. Yes, but you were aware that he
had worked with certain members of the Birmingham police “in
order to --

Mr. Adams. i He furnished many other instances also.

Senator Huddleston. So you weren't really doing a whole
lot to prevent that incident by telling the people who were
already part of it.

Mr. Adams. We were doing everything we could lawfully
do at the time, and finally the situation was corrected, so tha
when the Department, agreeing that we had no further. juris-
diction, could sent the United States Marshal down to perform:

certain law enforcement functions.

Senator Huddleston. Now, the Committee. has received
documents which indicated that in one situation the FBI assiste
an informant who had been established in a white hate group ]
to establish a rival white hate Groupe and that the Bureau paid
his expenses in setting ug this rival organization.

Now, does this not put the Bureau in a position of ‘being
responsible for what actions the rival white hate group might
have undertaken? aa

Mr. Adams. I'd like to see if one of the other gentlemen
knows that specific case, because I don't think we set up a
specific group.

This is Joe Deegan.

Mr. Deegan. Senatcr, it's my understanding that the
informant we're talking about decided to break off from the
group he was with, He was with the Macon Klan group of °
the United Klans of America, and he decided “to break off. This
was in compliance with our regulations. His breaking off,
we did not pay him to set up the Deans etalon He did it
on his own. .We paid him for the information he furnished
us concerning the operation. We did not sponsor the ‘organiza-
tion.

Senator Huddleston. Concerning the new organization that
he set up, he continued to advise you of the activities of that

organization?

Mr. Deegan. No, it did ‘not, -and it did not last that

Senator Huddleston, ‘There's also evidence of an FBI

responsibility within the Party with the knowledge of his
FBI contact of supplying members with weapons and instructing
them in how to use those weapons. Presumably ‘this was in the -

How does this square with your enforcement and crime
prevention responsibilities.

Mr. Deegan.. Senator, I'm not familiar with that particulay
case. - Tt does not square with our policy in all respects, and
I would have to look at that particular case you're talking
about to give you an answer.

Senator Huddleston. I don't have the documentation on that

So we not only have a policy, I feel that we do follow

Senator Huddleston. Well, Mr. Rowe's statement is
substantiated to some extent with the acknowledgement by the
agent in charge that if you're going to be a Klansman and you
happen to be with someone and they decide to.do something, that
he couldn't be an angel. These were the words of the agent,.
and be a good informant. .He wouldn't take the lead; but the
implication is that he would have to go along and would have
to be involved if he was going to maintain his credibility.

times. will have to be present. during demonstrations, riots,

fistfights that take place, but I believe his statement was

Senator Tower. Senator Mathias.

‘Senator. Mathias. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to come back very briefly to the Fourth
anoodnene considerations in connection with the use of informants
and in posing these questions we're not thinking of the one
time volunteer who walks in to an FBI office and says I have
a. story I want to tell you and that's the only time that you
may see him, I'm thinking of the kind of situations in which

there is a more extended relationship which could be of varying

will have some usefulness in a number of situations. But when

the FBI orders a regular agent to engage in a search, the first

test is a judicial warrant, and what I would Like! to explore
with you is the difference between a one time search which
requires a warrant, and which you get when you make that
search, and a continuous search which uses an informant, or.
the case of a continuous search which uses a regular undercover
agent, someone who is totally under your control, and is ina

slightly different category than an informant.

“Mr. Adams. Well, we get there into the fact that the

Supreme Court has still held that the use of informants does

not invade any of these constitutionally protected areas, ,and

if a person wants to tell an informant something that isn't
protected by the Supreme Court.

An actual search for legal evidence, that is a protected
item, but information and the use of informants have been
consistently held as not posing any constitutional problems.

Senator Mathias. JI would agree, if you're talking about
the fellow who walks in off the street, as I said earlier,
but is it true that under existing Veseeauees informants are
given background checks?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. And they are subject to a testing period

Mr. Adams. That's right, to verify and make sure they
are providing to us reliable information. |

Senator Mathias. And during the period that the relation-
ship continues, ‘they are rather closely controlled by the
handling agents.

“Mr. Adams. That's true.

Senator Mathias. So in effect they can come in a very

practical way agents themselves to the FBI.-

Mr. Adams.. They can do nothing --

Senator Mathias. Certainly agents in the common law use
of the word.

glean all the information that he wants, and that’ is not in the
Constitution as a protected area. But we do have this problem.

Senator Mathias. But if a regular agent who is a member
of the FBI attempted to enter these premises, he would require
a warrant?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, if a regular -- it depends on the
purpose for which he is entering. If a regular agent by
concealing his identity, by "-- was admitted as.a member of the

Communist Party, he can attend Communist Party meetings, and he

‘can enter the premises, he can enter the building, and there's

no constitutionally invaded area there.
Senator Mathias. And so you feel that anyone who has
a less formal relationship with the Bureau than.a.regular
agent, who can undertake a continuous surveillance operation

Mr. Adams. As long as he commits no illegal acts.

Mr, Adams. The main difficulty is the particularity
which has to be shown in obtaining a search warrant. You
have to go after particular evidence. You have to specify
what you're going after, and an informant operates in an
area that you just cannot eT He doesn't know what's
- going, to be discussed at ‘that meeting. It may be a plot to
blow up the Capitol Saat or it may be a plot to blow up the
State Department building. .

Senator Mathias. If it were a criminal investigation,
you would have little ‘difficulty with probable cause, wouldn't
you?

Mr. Adams. We would have difficulty in a warrant to
use uoneane as.an informant in that area because the same
difficulty of particularity exists. We can't specify.

Senator Hathias. ‘r understand the problem because it's
very similar to ons that we discussed earlier in connection
say wiretaps on a national security problem.

Mr. Adams. That's it, and there we face the problem of
where the Soviet, an individual identified as a Soviet spy
in a friendly country and they tell us he's been a Soviet spy
there and now he's coming to the United States, and if a can't
show mee a probable cause warrant, if we couldn't show that
; he was actually engaging in espionage in the United States,
we couldn't get a wiretap under the probable cause requirements

which have been discussed, If the good fairy didn't drop the

kind of a warrant requirement it we could agree on the language}

Mr. Adams. If we can work out problems and the Attorney
General is personaly interested in that also.

*” senator Mathias. Do you think that this agreement, might -
extend to some of those other areas, that we talked about?

Mr. Adams. I think that that would be a much greater
difficulty in an area of domestic intelligence informant who
reports on many different operations and different types of
activities that might come up rather than say in a Soviet
“ espionage or.a foreign espionage a where you do have a little
more degree of specificity to deal with.

j “Senator Mathias. I suggest that we arrange to get
together and try out some drafts with each other, but in the
meantime, of course, there's another alternative and that
- would be the use of wiretap procedure by which the Attorney
General must approve a wiretap before it is placed, “and the
same general process could be used for informants, since
you pues to headquarters any way.

Mr. Adams. That could be an alte guitive. I think it

would be a very burdensome alternative +d I think at some

major abuses of Congress and get over this hurdle, I think
we're still going to have to recognize that heads of agencies
have to accept the responsibility for managing that agency
and we can't just keep pushing every operational problem up
to the top because there just aren't enough hours in the’ day.

Senator Mathias. But the reason that parallel suggests
itsels is of course the fact that.the wiretap deals generally |
with one level of information in one sense of gathering
information. You hear what you hear from the tap.

Mr. Adams, But you're dealing in a much smaller number
also.

Senator Mathias. Smaller number, but that's all .the
more reason. When an informant goes in, he has all of his
senses. He's gathering all of the information a human being
can acquire from a situation and has access to more information
than the ote wiretap.

And it would seem to me that for that reason a. parallel
process might be useful ‘and in order.

“Mr . Adams, Mr. Mintz pointed out one other main
distinction. to me which I had overlooked from our prior
discussions, which is the fact that with an informant he is
more in.the position of being a concentral monitor in that one
of the two parties to the conversation agrees, such as like
concentral monitoring of telephones and microphones and

anything else versus the wiretap itself where the individual

whose telephone is being tapped is not Grete and there is, -
and neither of the two parties talking had agreed that their

Senator Mathias. I find that one difficult to accept.
I£ I'm the third party overhearing a conversation that is takind
place in a room where I am, and my true character isn't perceived
by the two people who are talking, “in effect they haven't :
consented to my overhearing my conversation. Then they consent
if they believe that I am their friend or their, a partisan
of theirs.

But if they knew in fact that I was an informant for
someone else, they wouldn't be consenting.

Mr. Adams. Well, that's like I believe Senator, Hart
raised earlier, that the courts thus far have made this
distinction with no difficulty, but that doesn't mean that

_ there may not be some legislative compromise which might be

addressed.

Senator Mathias. Well, I particularly appreciate your
attitude in being willing to work on these problems because
I think that's the most important thing that can evolve from
these hearings, so that we can actually look at the Fourth

Amendment as the standard that we-have ts achieve. But the

way we, get there is obviously going to i “a lot easier if we

can work toward them together.

cause that a crime has been committed as a means of ‘controlling

_ the use of informants and the kind of information that they

collect.

Do you feel that‘this would be too restrictive?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir, I do.

When I look at informants and I see that each year
informants provide us, locate 5000 dangerous fugitives, they
provide subjects in 2000 more cases, they ei $86 million
in stolen property and contraband, and that's irrespective
of what we give the lcecal law enforcement and other Federal
agencies, which is almost a comparable figure, we have almost

reached a point in the criminal law where we'don't have much

left. And in the intelligence field we still, I think when

we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure
that we have the means to gather information which will permit
us to be aware of the ddentity of individuals and organizations
that are acting to overthrow the government of the United
States. And I think we still: have some areas to look hard

at as we have discussed, but I think informants are here to.
stay. They are absolutely essential to law enforcement.

the Honorable Clarence M..Kelley, the Director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquély qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importance
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather
than on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light

in our hearings occurred years and even decades before Directoy

Kelley took charge.

The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli-4
gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.

The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in

developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-}|
lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certain
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance technique
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.

_ The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

recommendations that will strengthen the American people's

espionage.

Director Kelley, we are pleased to welcome you, and if
you would have a prepared statement you would like to lead off

with, please proceed.

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY,

DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and
gentlemen.

I welcome the interest which this Committee has shown in
the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli 4
gence and internal security fields.

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis4
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.

This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other. than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as
possible in responding to your questions and complying with your

requests.

I believe we have lived up to those promises.

The members and staff of this Committee have had unprece-
dented access to FBI information.

You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-type|
investigations and who are personally involved in every facet
of our day-to-day intelligence operations. ,

You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who
have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with
all major areas of our activities and operations in the national
security and intelligence fields,

In brief, you have had firsthand examination of these
matters that is unmatched at any time in the history of the
Congress.

As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of
necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I
credit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's
record of performance.

It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus
on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
organization.

The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the
lion's share of public attention and critical comment constituted
an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

A Justice Department Committee which was formed last year

to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's Counterintelligence
Programs has. reported that in the five basic ones it- found
3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI
Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,

less than three fourths, were approved.

I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were
being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era
when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative
matters per year.

Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed
regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate
and understandable.

The question might well be asked what I had in mind when
I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it
did under the circumstances then existing would have been an
abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..

What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is

that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what they

felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney General,

the Congress, and the people of the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and
buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige
to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and
killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such

acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,
and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights. :

There were many calls for action from Members of Congress
and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and other
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to countér conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may welll
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet

an imminent threat-to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing’ is to be carried
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by investigatin
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the
ability to prevent? I refer to those instances where there is
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to
human life.

Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt,
the Congress must consider the question of whether or not such
preventive action should be available to the FBI.

These matters are currently being addressed by a task
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI,
and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls a
= developed in cooperation with pertinent Committees of Congress
to insure that such measures are used in an entirely responsible
manner.

Probably the most important: question here today is what
cere I can give that the errors and abuses which arose
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub-
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as
Director on July 9, 1973.

Today we place a high premium on openness, openness
both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion

in the decision-making process which insures that no future
program or major policy decision will ever be adopted without a
full and critical review of its propriety.

Participatory management has become a fact in the FBI.

I have made it known throughout our Headquarters and
Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, regardless of
position or degree of experience, to contribute their thoughts
and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms or

reservations they may have concerning any area of our. operations

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. “My goal is to achieve maximum
eritical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure.

The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, “as a 'lightning rod' to deflect improper requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,

considering the context of the request, I believed presented

the appearances of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I have to the
Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years a
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no
one has approached me or made overtures, directly or otherwise,
to use the FBI for partisan political or other improper
purposes.

I can assure you that I would not for a moment consider

honoring any such request.

I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI
I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney General and
the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including
those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and|
practices, These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the. FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means...

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the
character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

I am proud of the 19,000 men and women with whom it is

my honor to serve today. Their dedication, their professionali

their standards, and the self-discipline which they personally |}

demand of themselves and expect of their associates are the
nation's ultimate assurance of proper and responsible conduct
at all times by the FBI.

The Congress and the members of this Committee in
particular have gained a great insight into. the. problems
confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields,
problems which all too often we have left to resolve without
sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or the Congress
itself.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment have been
made. But no one who is looking for the cause of our
failures should confine his search solely to the FBI, or even
to the Executive Branch.

fhe Congress itself has long possessed the mechanism for
FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been exercised.

An initial step was taken in the Senate in 1973 when the
Committee on the Judiciary established a Subcommittee on FBI
Oversight. Hearings had been commenced, and we were fully
committed to maximum participation with the members of that
Subcommittee.

I laud their efforts. However, those efforts are of very
recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.

One of the greatest benefits of the study this Committee
has made is the expert knowledge you have gained of the complex

problems confronting the FBI. But I respectfully submit that

those benefits are wasted if they do not lead ‘to the next step,
a step that I believe is absolutely essential ,a legislative
charter, expressing Congressional determination of intelligence.
jurisdiction for the FBI.

Action to resolve the problems confronting us in the
security, and intelligence fields is urgently needed; and it
must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither the Cangress
nor the public can afford to look the other way, leaving it to
the FBI to do what must be done, as too often has occurred in
the past.

This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of|
our performance.

I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative
process and, thereby, would take over what historically have
been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast
them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con-
gressional oversight or Executive decision.

The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable determination

when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.

It must be sufficiently flexible that it does alle stifle
the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly address the demonstrated problems of the past;
yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times change -and
so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive
‘challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced
the formulation of operational guidelines governing our
intelligence activities does not in any manner diminish the nee
for legislation. The responsibility for conferring juris-
diction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals which

question the need for intelligence gathering, suggesting that
information needed for the prevention of Digiece can be
acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations.

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations
that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective
and in the time of initiation. In the usual criminal case, a
crime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence

for prosecution. Since the investigation normally follows

the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well be
not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government: has enough information to meet any future crisis
or emergency. The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also whethe
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on

our anticipation of those criminal acts. Anticipation,

in turn, is dependent on advance information, that is, intelli-
gence.

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues,
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need
for intelligence work can be documented to the full satisfaction
of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is not
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful,
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee or
its successors in this important task.

In any event, you have my unqualified assurance as
Director that we will carry out both the letter and the spirit
of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

That is the substance of my prepared statement.

- I would also like to say extemporaneously that I note
that on this panel are some gentlemen who were on the Judiciary
Committee Which heard my testimony at the time I was presented
to them for candidacy as Director of the FBI. At that time

I took very seriously the charge which may possibly result

in the deliberation of this Committee and of the full Senate.
I have been well aware of the problems of the FBI since that
time. I have also been well aware of the capabilities of

the FBI to discharge those responsibilities. I don't take

them lightly. I am of sufficient experience and age that I
have pledged myself to do what is good and proper. I say this
not as a self-serving statement but in order that we might
place in context my position within the FBI. I could seek
Sanctuary and perhaps a safe sanctuary by saying during the
period these things occurred I was with the local police -
department in Kansas City, Missouri. Prior to that time,
however, I was in the FBI.

During the time I was with the FBI, during the time I
was with the police department, I continued Sao wanone that
period a close acquaintance with and a strong affection for
the FBI.

I only want to point out that based on those years, based
on those observations, we have here a very fine and very
sensitive and a very capable organization. I feel that there
is much that can still be done. I know that we are not without
fault. I know that from those experiences I have had. .We
will not be completely without fault in the future. But I
assure you that we look upon this inquiry, we look upon any
mandate which you may feel you have, that you should look at --
this is good and proper, and we do not intend -~ I only want
to place in your thinking the fact that you have here a

not motivated in some of these instances, and in most of

them, and I cannot justify some, that the motivation was of a

only putting in your thinking my objective observations as

organization. It is too precious for us to have it in
a condition of jeopardy.

Thank you very much.

I want to turn first to Senator Hart who won't be able
to remain through the whole morning. I think he has one

qpestion he would like to ask.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Mathias and I have Judiciary Committee hearings at 10:30.
Gaon several questions, and I'm sure they'll be
covered by others, but the ones that I have is a result of
reading your testimony and listening to it this morning, and
it relates to your comment at the foot of cagee and at the
top of ll.

There you are indicating that you caution us about
extending the court's role in the early stages of investigations
suggesting that this might take us beyound the role comtemplatefl
for the courts under the Constutution.

Now as you have said, aside from the so-called national
security wiretap problem, the main focus of our discussions
and concern has been on the possibility requiring court
approval for the use of informants, informants directed to
penetrate and report on some group.

And one of the witnesses yesterday, Professor Dorsen,
pointed our that really those informants are the most pervasivel
type of an eavesdropping device. It is a human device. It's
really, an informant is really more intrusive on my privacy
than a bug or a tap because he can follow me anywhere. He
can ask me questions to get information the government would
like to have.

Now we certainly involve the courts in approval of the

wiretaps for physical searches with the intent of the drafters

of the Constitution to have a: neutral third party magistrate
screen use of certain investigative techniques. And the
informant is such a technique. He functions sort of like a
general warrant, and I don't see why requiring court approval
would violate the role envisaged for the courts.

And as I leave, I would like to get vel reactions ae
my feelings.

Mr. Kelley. I do not feel that there is any use of the
informant in intrusion, which is to this extent objectionable.
It has of course been approved, the concept of the informant,
by numerous court decisions.

Let us go down not to the moral connotation of the use
of the informant.

I think, as in many cases, that is a matter of balance.
You have only very few ways of solving crimes. You have
basically in the use of the informant, I think, the protectian
of the right of the victim to be victimized. You have within
the Constitution certain grants that are under ordinary
circumstances abrogation of rights. The right of search and
seizure, which, of course, can't be unreasonable, but none-
theless, you have the right.

I think that were we to lose the right of the informant,
we would lose to a great measure our capability of doing our
job.

Now I'm not arguing with you, Senator, that it is not an

unusual procedure. I'm not even going to say that it is not
an intrusion, because it is. But it has to be one. I think
that is by virtue of the benefits must be counted.

We don't like to use it. We don't like the problems that
are attendant. We take great care.

Now you say about the court having possibility taking
jurisdiction over them and guiding. I think that possibly we
could present the matter to the court but what are they going
to do insofar as monitoring their effort? Are they going to
have to follow it all the way through?

Also, there is; of Soiree: urgency in the other contacts.
Must the court be contacted for each and approval of the court
given for each contact?

There are a great many problems insofar as administration
of it.

I frankly feel, and again, all I can do is give you my
idea -- I frankly feel that there is a eed control ovey
the informants as we now exercise it today. Yes, there are
going to be some who will get beyond our control, but this
is going to happen no matter what you do.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I appreciate your
reaction.

I was not suggesting that there is consideration here -to
prohibit informants. I was reflecting a view that I felt and

hold that the use of an informant does require some balance, as

you yourself said, and I would be more comfortable with a :
third party making a judgment as to whether the intrusion is

warranted by the particular circumstance. But I do understand

‘your position.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hart.

(Senator Hart leaves the hearing room.)

The Chairman. Senator Baker, do you have questions?

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

Mr. Kelley, I have a great respect.for you and your
organization and I personally regret that the organization is
in political distress, but we've both got to recognize that
it is, along with other agencies and departments of the
government.

I think you probably would agree with me that even though
that is extraordinarily unpleasant and in many respects
unfortunate, that it also has a plus side. That is, it gives
us an indication of our future direction and the opportunity,
at least, to improve the level of competency and service of
the government itself.

With that hopeful note, would you be agreeable then to
volunteering for me any suggestions you have on how to improve
the responsiveness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or
indeed, for any other law enforcement agencies of the Eleni aegen

to the Congress, to the Attorney General, to the President, and

beyond that, would you give me any suggestions you have on
how you would provide the methods, the access, the documents,
the records, the authority, for the Congress to perform its
essential, I believe, essential oversight responsibility to
see that these functions, these delicate functions are being
undertaken properly?

And before you answer, let me tell you two or three thing:
I am concerned about.

It hasn't been long ago that the FBI Director was not
even confirmed by the Senate of the United States. I believe
you are the first one to be confirmed hy the Senate of the
United States. I think that is a movement in the right
direction. I think the FBI has taken on a stature that, an
additional importance that requires it to have closer supervisipn
and scrutiny by us.

At the same time I rather doubt that we can become
involved in the daily relationship between you and the Attorney}
General.

Therefore, I tend to believe that the Attorney General
needs to be more directly involved in the operations of the
FBI.

I would appreciate any comments on that.

Second, I rather believe that major decisions of the
intelligence community and the FBI ought to be in writing, so

that the Congress can, if it needs to in the future, take a

look at these decisions and the process by which they were
made to decide that you are or you are not pee eoenang your
services diligently.

I don't think you can have oversight unless you have
access to records, and in many cases records don't exist
and in some cases the people who made those decisions are now
departed and in other cases you have conflicts.

How would you suggest: then that you improve the quality
of service of your agency? How would you propose that you
increase the opportunity for oversight of the Congress of the
United States? What other suggestions do you have for improvin:
the level of law enforcement in the essential activity that
is required?

Mr. Kelley. I would possibly be repetitious in answering
this Senator, but I get a great deal of pleasure from telling
what I think is necessary and what I hope that I have followed,
one which is beyond my control, but which I think is very
important is that the position of Director, the one to which
great attention should be paid in choosing the man who will
properly acquit himself.

I feel that the Judiciary Committee, at least in going
over me, did a pretty good job. I feel that it is most
necessary that care be taken that his philosophy, his means
of management, his facility to adapt to change, his tendency

toward consulting with other members of the official family,

that he be willing to, for example, go through oversight with
no reticence, and that I think that he should be chosen very
carefully.

I think further that he should be responsible for those
matters which indicate impropriety or illegality.

Senator Baker. Could you stop for just a second? Who
does he work for? Does the Director, in your view, work for
the President of. the United States, for the Attorney General,
for the Justice Department, for the Executive Branch?

Who does the executive of the FBI, the Director of the
FBI, be responsible to, who should he be responsible to?

Mr. Kelley. Jurisdictionally, to the Attorney General,
but I think this is such an important field of influence that
it is not’at all unlikely that we can expand it to the
judiciary, the legislative, and of course, we are under the
Attorney General.

Senator Baker. Do you have any problems with the idea
of the President of the United States calling the Director of
the FBI and asking for performance of a particular task?

Does that give you any difficulty? Or do you think that
the relationship between the FBI Director and the President
is such that that is desirable, or should it he conduited
through the Attorney General?

Mr. Kelley. I think it should be in the great majority

of the cases conduited through the Attorney General. There

has been traditionally some acceptance of the fact that if
the President wants to see and talk with the Director, he
may do so, call him directly.
It has been my practice in such an event to thereafter
report to the Attorney General, whoever it might be, that I

have been called over and I discussed and was told. And this

was revealed in full to them,

Senator Baker. I suppose we could pass a statute that
says the President has to go through the Attorney General,
although I rather “suspect it would be a little presumptuous,

But to go the next step, do you think it is necessary
for the pursuit of effective oversight on the part of the
Congress, to have some sort of document written, sul at least
some sort of account of a Presidential order or an order of
the Attorney General given to a Director of the FBI?

Do you think that these things need to be handled in
a-more formal way?

Mr. Kelley. Personally, it would be my ee in
the event I receive such an order, to request that it be
documented. This is a protection as well as a clarification
as to whether or not it should be placed as part of legislation
I frankly would like to reserve that for some nea considera~
tion.

I don't know whether it would be, but I think that it

can be worked very easily.

Senator Baker, Mr. Kelley, Attorney General Levi, I
believe, has already established some sort of agency or
function within the Department that is serving as the equivalent,
I suppose, of an Inspector General of the Justice Department,
including the FBI.

Are you familiar with the steps that Mr. Levi has
taken in that respect? I think he calls it the Office of
Professional Responsibility.

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir, I'm familiar with it.

Senator Baker. Do you have any comment on that? Will
you give us any observations as to whether you think that
will be useful, helpful, ox whether it will not be useful or
helpful, how it affects the FBI, how you visualize your
relationship to it in the future?

Mr. Kelley. I don't object to this, which is to some
extent an oversight within the Department of Justice under the
Attorney General.

Frankly, it just came out. I have not considered it
completely, but to the general concept, yes, I very definitely
subscribe,

Senator Baker. How would you feel about extending that

Mr. Kelley. I will..

Senator Baker. All right. Mr. Chairman, thank you very
much.

The Chairman. Senator Huddleston.

- Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Kelley, you describe on pagé 4 the conditions that
existed when much of the abuse that we have talked about during
this inquiry occurred, indicating that the people within the
Bureau felt like they were doing what was expected of them
by the President, by the Attorney General, the Congress and
the people of the United States.

Does not this suggest that there has pee a reaction
there to prevailing attitudes that might have existed in the
country because of certain circumstances rather than any
clear and specific direct instructions that might have been
received from proper authorities? And if that is the case,
is it possible in developing this charter, this guideline,
to provide for that kind of specific instruction?

Mr. Kelley. I think so, yes. I think that they can
logically be incorporated and that -~-

danger if any agency is left to simply react to whatever the
attitudes may be.at a specific time in this country because ~--

Mr. Kelley. Senator; I don't contemplate it might be
a continuing danger, but it certainly would be. a very acceptab]
guidepost whereby we can, in the event such a need seems
to arise, know what we can do.

Genator Huddleston. Well, in pursuing the area which
Senator Hart was discussing, that is whether or not we can
provide sufficient guidelines would replace a decision by the

court in determining what action might he proper and specific -

provide the restrictions and guidelines and the various
techniques that might be used?

For instance, supposing we do establish the fact, as
has already been done, that informants are necessary and
desirable. How do we keep that informant operating within the
proper limits so that he in fact is not violating individual
rights?

Mr. Kalley. Well, of course, much of the reliance must
be placed on the agent and.the supervision of the FBI to assure
that there is no infringement of rights.

Senator Huddleston. But this is an aware we've gotten
into some difficulty in the past. We have assumed that the
particular action was necessary, that there was a present

threat that some intelligence programs should be initiated, but

in,many cases it has gone beyond what would appear to have been
necessary to have addressed the original threat.

How do ue: keep within the proper balance there?

Mr. Kelley. Well,.actually, it's just about like any
other offense. It is an invasion of the other individual's
right and it is by an officer and an FBI agent is an officer.
There's the possibility of criminal prosecution against him.

This is one which I think might flow if He counsels”
the informant.

Now insofar as his inability to control the informant,

I don't suppose that would warrant prosecution, but there is
still supervisory control over that agent and over that
informant by insisting that control is exercised on a continuing
basis.

Senator Huddleston, It brings up an interesting point
as to whether or not a law enforcement agency ought to be
very alert to any law violations of its own members or anyone
else.

If a White House official asks the FBI or someone to do
something unlawful, the question seems to me to occur as to
whether or not that is not a violation that should be reported
by the FBI.

Mr. Kelley. I think that any violation which comes to
our attention should either be handled by us or the proper

authority.

Senator Huddleston. But that hasn't been the case in the
past. ,

Mr. Kelley. Well, I don't know what you're referring
to but I would think your statement is eral

Senator Huddleston. Well, we certainly have evidence
of unlawful activity taking place in various projects that
have been undertaken, which certainly were not brought to
light willingly by the FBI or by other law enforcement agencies

The question that I'm really concerned about is as
we attempt to draw a guideline and charters that would give
the Agency the best flexibility that they may need, a wide
range of threats, how do we control what happens within each
of those actions to keep them from going beyond eeu

was intended to begin with?

Mr. Kelley. You're still speaking of informants.

Senator Huddleston. Not only informants but: the agents
themselves as they go into surveillance, wiretaps, or whatever
intelligence gathering techniques.

The original thrust of my question was, even though we
may be able to provide guidelines of a broad Satu: how do
we control the techniques that might be used, that ini themselves
might be used, that in themselves might be a serious violation
of the rights.

Mr. Kelley. Well, first, I don't know whether it's
germane to your question but I do feel that it should be pointed
out that the association to, the relationship between the
informant and his agent handler is a very confidential one,
and I doubt very seriously whether we could have any guide-
lines, where there might be an extension of any monitors here
because thereby you do have a destruction of that relationship4
Insofar as thé activities of agents, informants or others
which may_be illegal, we have on many occasions learned of
violations of the law on the part of informants, and either
prosecuted ourselves, through the reporting of it to the
United States Attorney, or turned it over to the local authority.
We have done this on many a time, many occasions. Insofar
as our own personnel, we have an internal organization, the
Inspection Division, which reviews this type of activity, and

if there be any violation, yes, no question about it, we would

smn 2 e ® 2479
i 1 pursue it to the point of prosecution.
: 2 Senator Huddleston. But it could be helped by periodic
j 3 review.
4 Mr. Kelley. We ao on an annual basis, review the
5 activities of our 59 offices through that same Inspection
6 Division, and they have a clear charge to go over this as well
” as other matters.
8 Senator Huddleston. Mr. Kelley, you pointed. out the
9 difference in the approaches when gathering intelligence, in
10 gathering evidence after a crime has been committed.
1 : Would there be any advantage, or would it be feasible to
| H 12 attempt to separate these functions within the ee in the
8 : ‘
| g 13 departments, for instance, with not having a mixing of
f 14 gathéring intelligence and gathering evidence? Are the techniques
15 definable and different?:
16 Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think they are compatible. I
17 see no objection to the way that they are now being handled

18 on a management basis. I think, as a matter of fatt, it is

19 a very fine association whereby the intelligence, stemming as

20 it does from a substantive violation, is a natural complement.
| 21 Senator Huddleston. Now, another area, the FBI furnishes

22 information to numerous government agencies.

23 Is this properly restricted and controlled at the present

who might also be inclined to call the Director and ask him
to do specific things?

Could there be some clearcut understanding as to whether
or not the Director would be obligated to undertake any such
project, that just anybody at the White House might suggest?

Mr. Kelley. It's very clear to me that any request must
come from Mr. Buchen's office, and that it be, in any case,
wherein it is a request for action, that it be followed with
a letter so requesting. ‘

This has come up before during the Watergate hearings, as
I think it has been placed very vividly in our minds, in
take care that you just don't follow the request of some
underling who does not truly reflect.the desire of the Presiden

Senator Huddleston. Just one more question about
techniques, aside from the guidelines of authority on broad
projects undertaken.

Would it be feasible from time to time in a Congressional
oversight committee, would be able to discuss with the pepartnd
with the Bureau various techniques so that they could have
some input as to whether or not these actions are consistent .
with the overall guidelines, to start with, and consistent
with the very protections?

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I have already said.to.the
oversight committee of the Senate that so far as I can now

see, the only thing that would be withheld is the identity of

probably even more importantly, what restrictions can be put
on the use of that information once it has been supplied by
the FBI? cee

Mr. Kelley. I think so, Senator.

Senator Huddleston. You think there are proper restrictiqns

now?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know that we can ourselves judge
in all cases whether or not there is good and sufficient reason
for an Agency to inquiry. I think that there should be a
very close delineation by the agencies as to what they're
going to ask for, but I think that we do have sufficient rules
that at least to us we are satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. You're confident that the information
your agency supplies is not being misused, to the detriment
of the rights of any individuals.

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I'm only confident in what I
do myself. I would say that I am satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. I was wondering whether some
inclusion ought to be made in whatever charter is made as to
who specifically can request, what limits ought to be ‘placed
on what the request, and what they can do with it after they
get it.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Senator Huddleston. I have some concern about the fact

that in intelligence gathering, you gather, you are just

bound to gather a great deal of information about some
individual that is useless as far as the’ intent of the intelli-
gence gathering is concerned, but might be in some way embarras'
sing or harmful to the individual, whether or not there's any
effort to separate this kind of information out of a person's
file that is really initiated for a purpose, for a specific
purpose unrelated to this information.

Is there any effort, or could any direction be given to
doing that?

Mr. Kelley. We would be very happy to work under the
guidelines or rules or anything else to purge material which
is extraneous, irrelevant, or for any other reason objection-
able.

Senator Huddleston. And how about the length of time
that these files are kept in the agency?

Mr. Kelley. We are willing to work within that framework,
too.

Senator Huddleston. I think that might be done.

Now, I think in developing the chain of command, so to
speak, it certainly would be very difficult to prevent the
President of the United States from calling up the head of
the FBI or anyone else and discussing any law enforcement
problem he might so desire, and perhaps even give direction
to the agency.

But how about that? What about White House personnel

informants. We'll discuss techniques, we'll discuss our
present activities. I think this is the only pili that we can
exchange our opinions and get accomplished what you want to
accomplish and what I want to accomplish.

Senator Huddleston. I feel that is an important aspect
of it because even though you have a charter which gives broad
direction for all the guidelines and to the types of projects
that enter into it, if we don't get down to specifics, such
things as how intelligence is to be collected, how evidence

is to be collected, what is done after it is collected, this

again for the Bureau to assume that it has total instruction
and total permission to move in a certain direction and go
beyond what is intended or what was authorized.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Director.

The Chairman. Senator Goldwater?

Senator Goldwater. Mr. Kelley, as part of the FBI
electronic surveillance of Dr. King, several tapes of
specific conversations, and later a composite King tape were
produced.

Are these tapes still in the possession of the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by you?

Mr. Kelley. No, sir.

staff, to your knowledge?

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think ence they have been reviewed}
I know that at least some have reviewed it within the area of
this particular section. There has been no review of them
since I came to the FBI, I can tell you that.

Senator Goldwater. Would these tapes be available to
the Committee if the Committee felt they would like to hear
them?

Mr. Kelley. This, Senator Goldwater, is a matter which igs
of, as I said before, some delicacy, and there would have to :
be a discussion of this in an executive session.

The Chairman. I might say in that connection that the
Committee staff gave some consideration to this matter and
decided that it would compound the original error for the
staff to review the tapes, because that would be a still
further invasion of privacy, and so the staff refrained from
insisting on obtaining the tapes, believing that it was
unnecessary, and quite possibly improper, in order to get at
what.we needed to know about the King case.

So the staff did refrain, and for that reason the issue
never came to a head. I just wanted to lay that information
before the Senator.

Senator Goldwater. I realize that's a prerogative of
the staff, but it's also the prerogative of the Committee if,

and I'm not advocating it, if we wanted to hear them to

ourselves whether Mr. Hoover was off on a wild goose chase
or whether there was, in effect, some reason. Again, I am
not advocating it, I am merely asking a question. They would
be available if the Committee took a vote to hear them and
decided on it.

Mr. Kelley. I don't think it would be within my ‘juris-
diction to respond to this, Senator. It would have to be the
Attorney General.

Senator Goldwater. I see.

Now, are these tapes and other products of surveillance
routinely retained even after an individual ceased to be a
target of inquiry?

Mr. Kelley. "they are retained usually for ten years.

Senator Goldwater. Ten years.

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. What is the future value, if any,
to the Bureau of retaining such information?

Mr. Kelley. If there be guidelines that set out a
destruction or erasure,we will abide by it. We will, on those
occasions where we think that matters might come up within
that period of time which may need the reténtion of them, we
will express our opinion at that time, but other than that
we would be guided by guidelines.

Senator Goldwater. Is it your view that legitimate

law enforcement needs should outweigh privacy considerations

with respect to retention of such information, or do we need
the clear guidelines on the destruction of these materials
when the investigation purposes for which they were collected
have been served?

Mr. Kelley. We feel that there should be a good close
look at the retention of material, and we would of course like
to have an input. But we welcome consideration of this.

Senator Goldwater. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Tha
you very much.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

Senator Mondale?

Senator Mondale. Mr. Director, it seems to me that the
most crucial question before the Congress is to eecet the
invitation of the FBI to draw Congressionally imposed lines,
limits of authority so the FBI will know clearly what you can
and cannot do, so you will not be subject to later judgments,
and the question is, where should that line be drawn?

As you know, in 1924 when the FBI was created, and
Mr. Stone later became the Chief Justice, he drew the line at
criminal law enforcement. He said that never again will we

go beyond the authority-imposed upon us to get into political

_ideas. We will stay in the area of law enforcement.

Would you not think it makes a good deal of sense to
draw the guidelines in a way that your activities are

restricted to the enfoncement of the law, investigations of

crime, investigations of conspiracies to commit erime rather
than to leave this very difficult to define aa control area
of political ideas?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know whether I understand your last
statement of involving the area of political ideas. I-+say that
I feel that certainly we should be vested eat nada continue
in the field of criminal investigations as an investigatory
objective. These are conclusions, of course, which are based
on statutes in the so-called security field, national. or
foreign.

These are criminal violations. I feel that they should
be in tandem. I feel, having worked many years in this
atmosphere, that you have more ears and eyes and you have
more personnel working together, covering the same fields..

I do not think there should be a separation of the intelligence
matters, because it is a concomitant. It naturally flows

from the investigation of the security matters and the
criminal.

Senator Mondale. Mr. Kelley, what:Mr. Stone said was
this, that the Bureau of investigation is not concerned
with political or other’ opinions of individuals. It is
concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws
of the United States. When the police system goes beyond
these limits, it is dangerous to proper administration of

justice and human liberty.

Do.you object to that definition?

Mr. Kelley. I think that life has become much more
sophisticated and we have added to the so-called policeman's
area of concern some matters which were probably not as importa
at that time. I think that the fact that the FBI has been in
touch with the security investigations and the gathering of
intelligence is something which has proved to be at times
troublesome and given us great concern, but it is a viable,
productive procedure.

I don't know what Mr. Stone was thinking of entirely
of this course, but I can tell you about the procedure today.

Senator Mondale. You see, I think you recognize, if
that further step is taken, as you're recommending here, that
at that point it becomes so difficult to guarantee, and in
fact, in my Opinion, impossible to guarantee that we won't
see a recurrence of some of the abuses that we've seen in
the past, and I don't know how you establish any kind of
meaningful oversight on a function as nebulous as the one
you've just defined.

If the FBI possesses the authority.to investigate
ideas that they consider to be threats to.this nation's
security, particularly in the light of the record that we have
seen how that definition can be stretched to include practi-

cally everybody, including moderate civil rights leaders,

war dissenters and so on, how on earth can standards be developed

that would provide any basis for oversight?

How can you, from among other things, be Beseaeena from
criticism later on that you exceeded your authority or didn't
do something that some politician tried to pressure you into
doing?

Mr. Kelley. It might well be, Senator, that ten years
from now a Director of the FBI will be seated here and will be
eriticized for doing that which today is construed as very
acceptable.

Senator Mondale. Correct. And I have great sympathy
for the predicament the FBI finds itself in.

Mr. Kelley. And the Director.

Senator Mondale. And the Director especially, and that is
why I think it's in the interest of the FBI to get these lines
as sharply defined as possible, so that when you are pressured
to do things, or when, after the fact, people with good 20/20
hindsight can criticize you or the Bureau, that you can say
well, here are the standards that you gave us, and they specifi¢-
ally say this, and that is your answer. We have to live by
the law. If we don't define it specifically,it seems to me
that these excesses could reoccur, because I don't think it's
possible to define them, and the FBI is inevitably going to
be kicked back and forth, depending on personal notions of what
you should have done.

Don't you fear that?

Mr. Kelley. Not too much, Senator. I think we learned a
great lesson by virtue of Watergate, the revelations that have
come up as a result of this Committee's inquiries, the fact
that I think that we have a different type of spirit today
in the Bureau, the fact that, as I said before, you came in,
that I think the Bureau is a matchless organization, and they
are eager to do that which is vital and proper, and the fact
that we are getting a number of very fine young people in the

organization, people of the other ethnic backgrounds than we

had years ago. I think there is a greater understanding in
the Bureau today of what is the proper type of conduct.

We may not be able to project this on all occasions,
because we must equate this with the need and with our
experience, but if the precise guidelines be the goal, you're
going to have trouble. If, on the other hand, there be a
flexibility, I think that we can work very well within those
guidelines.

Senator Mondale. I think, as you know, I don't think
there is a better trained or higher professionally qualified
law enforcement organization in the world than the FBI. I
think we all agree it is superb. But the problem has been,
from time to time, that when you go beyond the area of
enforcing the law into the area of political ideas, that you
are subject to and in fact you leave the criminal field, you

get into politics. And that is where, it seems to me, that the

: 2 going to be subjected to fierce criticism in the future, no

j 3 matter how you do it. Once you get into politics, you get
4 into trouble.
5 Mr. Kelley. I agree to that, and I point out that in almost
6 every branch of the government and in every part, as a matter
9 of fact, every segment of our society, there are some who deviate
8 from the normal course. I feel that within the Bureau there is
9 less likelihood of this to happen, and I think that working
10 || with you we can at least make some achievements that will be

2 12 Now, whether it be lasting, I don't think so, but I

: 14 Senator Mondale. In your speech in Montreal on August
15 9th, you said we must be willing to surrender a small measure

17 Which liberties did you have in mind?

protection. It's a matter of balance. Even in the Fourth

Amendment, for example, which protects the right of privacy, it

does not prohibit searches and seizures. I mention, it only

I came from the police fiedd. What is more restrictive
to more people than traffic regulation? But what would be
more chaotic is of you did not have traffic regulation. We
do have to , in order to love in the complexities and
intricacies of today's life, have to give up some of our
rights.

mean -- let me ask, Let me scratch. that and ask again, you
have to give up some tights. Which rights would you have us
give up?

have the right for search and seizure.

Senator Mondale. There's no such right in the Consti-
tution. You can have such seizures, but they must be reasonable
under court warrant.

Did you mean to go beyond that?

Mr. Kelley. That's right.

Senator Mondale. That you should be able to go beyond
that?

Mr. Kelley. No, no. I do not mean’ that we should ever
go beyond a Constitutional right guarantee.

Senator Mondale. Well, would you say, Mr. Kelley, that
that sentence might have been inartful in your speech?

Mr. Kelley. I said that if it was misunderstood, I
made a mistake, because I should never make a statement which 4-
yes, it was inartful. ,

Senator Mondale. I think I know about your record in
law enforcement well enough to tell you that I think you were
saying something different, that it was taken to mean something
different than I think you intended:

What you are saying is that in the exercise of your law
enforcement powers, the rights of individuals is determined
by the laws and the courts, but the courts, in the handling
of those issues, have to balance rights and other values.

That's what you're essentially saying, is that correct?

speeches so that I don't have any misunderstandings. I didn't

I have to admit that maybe I made a mistake.

Senator Mondale. What you are saying in effect is that

not by the Director of the FBI but by the courts and by the
law. : :

You meant that.

The Chairman. Senator Hart.

Senator of Colorado. Mr. Kelley, in a to
a question by Senaotr Mondale, one.of his first questions about
laying down guidelines, it seems to me what you were saying was
we could work together. That is to say the Bureau and the
Congress, lay down guidelines that would not foe sonably
hamper you from investigations of crime control in the
country.

But I think implicit in his question was also an area
that you didn't respond to, and that is how do see what kind
of guidelines do you lay down to protect you and the Bureau
from political pressure, the misuse of the Bureau by political
figures, particularly in the White House?

And we've had indications that at least two of your
predecessors, if not more, obviously were corrupted and Mr.
Gray was under great pressure from the White House to use
the facilities af the Bureau and their'capabilities to accomplijsh
some plititcal end.

Well, it seems to me you were arguing in favor of fewer
restrictions so you could get on with your job, but that is
not what Senator Mondale and the rest of us are interested in.

What .Kindof restrictions can we lay down to protect you
from political pressures? I'd be interested in that sign of the

coin, if you would.

Mr. Kelley. I would welcome any guidelines which would

protect me or any successor from this type of thing. I think
that would be splendid. I have not reviewed the guidelines
as prepared to the present date by the Department. It might
be that they are well defined in there. But I welcome any
consideration of such directives.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Do you think this is a problemP

Mr. Kelley. Wo, sir, not with me.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Do you think that it has been
a problem for the people that preceded you?

Mr. Kelley. JI think so.

Senator Hart of Colorado. And that's a problem the
Congress ought to address?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Senator Hart of Colorado. The Committee received a
letter from the Department of Justice a couple of days, the
Assistant Attorney General asking our cooperation in carrying
out the investigation or their efforts to review the investi-
gation conducted by the FBI into the death of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in order to determine whether that investigation
should be re-opened. They asked our cooperation, they asked
for our transcripts, the testimony before the Committee, all
material provided to the Committee by the FBI which relates
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

I guess my question is this: Why is the Justice Depart-

ment asking this Committee for FBI files?

Mr. Kelley. I don't think they're asking for files.

I think they're asking for what testimony was given by
witnesses whose testimony has not been given up. I don't know.
Senator Hart of Colorado. I'll quote it, "And all

material provided to the Committee by the FBI which relates
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference."

I repeat the question. Why is the Justice Department
asking this Committee for material provided to us by the
FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Frankly, I don't know. Do you mind if I
just ask --

(Pause)

Mr. Kelley. I am informed, and I knew this one.
Everything that was sent to you was sent through them. Did
they have a copy also? Yes, they had a retained copy. I
don't know why.

Senator Hart of Colorado. So there's nothing you
provided us that's not available to the Justice pele Nip |

Mr. Kelley. That's right.

Senator Hart of Colorado. And you can't account for why
an official of the Justice Department would ask this Committee
for your records?

Mr. Kelley. No, sir.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You released a statement on

November the 18th of '74 regarding the FBI's. counter-intelligent

program and you said you made a detailed study of COINTELPRO
activities me reached the following conclusions, and I quote:

"The purpose of these counter-intelligence programs was
to prevent dangerously and potentially deadly acts against
individuals, organizations and institutions both public
and private across the United States."

Now we had an FBI informant in the other day before this
Committee and he stated he told the FBI on a number of
occasions he planned violent acts against black people in
groups. And yet, he said few, if any, taetances! in which the
FBI actually prevented violence from taking place.

How does his testimony square with your statement that
I have quoted? °

Mr. Kelley. It doesn't, and I don't know if any of
his statements contrary to what we have said is the truth.

We don't subscribe to what he said. We have checked into it
and we know of no instances where, for example, 15 minutes
and that type of thing has been substantiated.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You're saying the testimony
he gave us under oath was not accurate?

Mr. Kelley. Right.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You also said in that statemen
and I quote: "I want to assure you that Director Hoover did
not conceal from superior authorities the fact that the FBI

was engaged in neutralizing and disruptive tactics against

Now the Committee has received testimony that the New
Left COINTELPRO programs was not in fact told to higher
authorities, the Attorney Gereral and Congress.

Do you have any information in this regard?

I know in that statement you cite onw or two instances,
but in terms of the bulk of COINTEL programs, the record
seems to date at least to be clear that there was not systematilc
information flowing upward through the chain of command to
Director Hoover's superiors?

Mr. Kelley: May I ask that I be given the opportunity
to substantiate that with documentation?

Senator Hart of Colorado. ‘sure.

Mr.. Kelley: Or respond to it.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Dorector Kelley, just in
passing, do you agree with the statement made by President
Ford that those responsible for harassing and trying to destroy
Dr. King should be brought to justice.

Mr. Kelley. Those who directly responsible and upon whcse orders
the activities were taken responsible. I don't know if he intended to say
that, but if he did not, I would say that it would be more proper. ‘Insofar
as my own opinion is concerned, that it be centered on those who said

Senator Hart of Colorado. But you agree that the people

The Chairman. Not quite?

Mr. Kelley. Not quite.

Senator Hart of Colorado. That's all, Nr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

Director Kelley, in the Committee's review of the
COINTELPRO program and other political involvements of the
FBI, it seems to me that we have encountered two or three
basic questions.

Since the investigation is over insofar as the Committee
is concerned, we're now turning our attention to remedies for
the future, what I would think would be our constructive
legislative work, it is very important that we focus on what
we learned in that investigation.

and one thing that we have learned is that Presidents of

the United States have from time to time ordered the FBI to

necessary surveillance to obtain .and to have a purely
political Piles that they simply wanted to have for their
own personal purposes.

I think that you would agree that that is not a proper
function of the FBI,,and you agree.

Yet it's awfflly difficult for anyone in the FBI,
including the Director, to turn down a President of the United
States if he receives a direct order from the President. It
is always possible, of course, to say no, and if you insist,

I will resign. But that puts a very hard burden on any man
serving in your position, particularly if the President puts
a good face on the request and makes it sound plausible or
even invents some excuse. It is alwavs easy for him to say,
you know, I am considering Senator White for an important
position in my administration, and I need to know more about
his activities, particularly of late. I've had some cause
for concern and I want to be certain that there is nothing in
his record that would later embarrass me, and I just want you
to keep careful track of him and report to me on what he's
been doing lately.

It's difficult for you to say back to the President, ir.
President, that's a very questionable activity for the FSI,
and I frankly don't believe that you've given me the real

reason why you want this man followed. I think his opposition

I mean, you know, the Director can hardly talk back that
way, and I'm wondering what we cauld do in the way of protectin
your office and the FBI from political exploitation in this
basic charter that we write. ,

Now, I want your suggestions, but let's begin with one
or two of mine. I would like your response.

If we were to write into the law that any order.given you
either by the President or by the Attorney General should be
transmitted in writing and should clearly state the objective
and purpose of the request and that the FBI would maintain
those written orders and that furthermore ‘they would be
available to any oversight committee of the Congress, If the
joint committee on intelligence is established, that committee
would have access to such a file.

So that the committee itself would be satisfied that
orders were not being given to the FBt that were improper or
unlawful.

What would you think of writing a provision of that kind
into a charter for the FBI? ,

Hr. Kelley. I would say writing into the law any order
issued by, the President that is a request for action by the
Attorney General should be in writing, is certainly, in my

opinion, is a very plausible solution. I'm sure that in

contemplation of this there would be some that will Say yes
or some that will say no, but I think we could define an
area where you are trying to cure the abuses and we could
do that.

Now as to the availability to any oversight committee
of Congress, I would say generally that I certainly would have
no objection to this, but I again, there may be some request
for something ce high confidentiality that the President might
put in writing such as some national or foreign security
Matter.

I would like to have such a consideration be given a
great deal of thought and that the oversight committee review
be conditioned with that possibility. I don't think it would
present a problem.

I have said previously that I feel I can discuss every-
thing except the identity of the informants to the oversight
committee. I welcome that.

The Chairman. Well, that has been of course the way we
proceeded with this Committee. It has worked pretty well,

I think.

Now Senator Goldwater brought up a question on the
Martin Luther King tapes. I would like to pursue that question

If these tapes do not contain any evidence that needs
to be preserved for ongoing criminal investigations, and since

Dr. King has long since been violently removed from the scene,

why are they preserved? Why aren't they simply destroyed?

Is there a problem that we can help through new law to enable
the FBI to remove from its files so much Of this information
that is has collected that it is no longer needed or may never
have connected the person with any criminal activity?’ And
yet, all of that information just stays there in the files
year after year.

What can we do? How can a law be changed? If that's
not the problem, then what is? Why are these tapes still down
there at the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Well, of course, we do have the rule that
they are maintained ten years. Now why the rule is your
question and why right now are they maintained? Since we
do maintain everything since the inquiry has started and until
that's lifted, we can't destroy anything.

I would say that this is a proper area for guidelines
or legislation and again, as I have said, there should he
some flexibility and I know that's a broad statement but there
might be some areas wherein that the subject of the ni
himself may want them retained because it shows his innocence.

I think you have to deliberate this very carefully, but
it can be done and we are willing to be guided by those
rules.

The Chairman, Let ie ask you this. The FBI is conducting

thousands of investigations every year on possible appointees

to Federal positions. As a matter of fact, the aan time I
ever see an FBI agent is when he comes around and flashes his
badge and asks me a question or two about what I know of Mr.
so and so, who's being considered for an executive office.

And we have a very brief conversation in which I tell him that
as far as I know, he's a loyal and patriotic citizen, and that
is about the extent of it.

Then when this file is completed and the person involved
is either appointed or not appointed, what happens to that
file? I know it's full of all kinds of gossip because it is
in the nature of the investigation to go out to his old
neighborhoods and talk to everybody who might have known him.

What happens to the file? Is that just retained forever?

Mr. Kelley. We have some capability of destroying some
files and they are rather lengthy insofar as retention. We
have some archival rules which govern the retention of mateial
and is developed in cases involving certain members of the
Executive Branch of the government.

I see no reason why this would not be a proper area
for consideration of legislation, ,

The Chairman. Can-you give me any idea of how much --
do you have records that would tell us how much time and money
is being spent by the FBI just in conducting these thousands
of routine investigations on possible Presidential appointments

to Federal offices?

Mr. Kelley. I feel confident we can get it. I do not
have it now, but if you would like to have the annual cost
for the investigation of Federal appointees --

The Chairman. Yes. Plus, you know, plus any other
information that would indicate to us what proportion of the
time and effort of the FBI was absorbed in this kind of
activity.

Mr. Kelley. I can tell you it is relatively small, hut
“I can get you, I think, the exact amount of time and the
approximate expense.

The Chairman. I wish you would do that because this is
a matter we need nore information about. And when you supply
that data to the Committee, would you also supply the number
of such investigations each year?

You know, I don't expect you to go back 20 or 25 years,
but give us a good idea of the last few years. For example,
enough to give us an idea of how much time and how broad the
reach of these investigations may be.

Mr. Kelley. Through '70?

fhe Chairman. That would be sufficient, I would think.

cone other matter that is connected to this same subject
that I would like your best judgment on is whether these
investigations could not be limited to offices of sensitivity.
That is to say where legitimate national security interest might}

be involved so that there is a reason to make a close check on

past associations, attitudes and expressions of belief.

I have often wondered whether we couldn't eliminate
routine Federal offices that are not particularly sensitive
in the national security sense from the reach of these FBI
checks.

And so when you respond to the series of questions, I
wish you would include the offices that are now covered by
such checks and give us an idea of how far down into the
Federal bureaucracy this extends.

Could you do that?

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

fhe Chairman. Fine.

Now there is a vote. The vote always comes just at
the wrong time, but Mr. Schwarz wants to ask you some additional]
questions for the record, and there may be other questions,
too that would be posed by the staff, after which I will ask
Mr. Schwarz to adjourn the hearings. It looks like we're going
to be tied up on the floor with votes,

But before I leave I want to thank you for your testimony,
lir. Kelley, and to express my appreciation to. you for the
way you have cooperated with the Committee in the course of
its investigation during the past months.

Mr. Kelley. Thank you.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Kelley, I'll try to be very brief.
On page 5 of your statement --
Mr. Kelley. What?
Mr. Schwarz. On page 5 of your statement, the third
full paragraph, you said the following, and I would like then
to question about what you said. "We must recognize that
situations have occurred in the past and will arise in the
future where the Government may well be expected to depart from
its traditional role, in the FBI's case, as an investigative
and intelligence-gathering agency, and take affirmative steps
which are needed to meet an imminent threat to human life or
property."

Now, by that you mean to take what kind of steps in what
kind of situation?

And can you give some concrete examples under your general
principles statement?

Mr. Kelley. I think that Mr. Adams addressed himself to
that the other day, where you have an extremist who is an
employee at the waterworks, and he makes a statement that he's
going to do something which is devastating to the city, and you
have no way to attack this under the ordinary procedures, and
so therefore you must take some steps to meet that imminent
threat to human life or property.

Mr. Schwarz. So let us take that case as a test of the

principle. You are saying the extremist has said he is going

to do something to the waterworks, poison it or something, and
hhe is on the way down there with the poison in his car.

Is that the presumption?

Mr. Kelley. We hadn't gone that far, but all right, you
can extent it.

Mr. Schwarz. All right, now, in that case you have the
traditional law enforcement tool, which is the power of arrest.
Mr. Kelley. Not under probable cause where he has not
gone down there. The hypothetical we gave was one where he had

not taken any overt acts in perpetration of this.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, if he hasn't taken any overt acts,
are you then in what you would call in imminent threat of
human life or property?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Schwarz. How so? Unless he has taken an overt act:
to buy the poison or to get in the car with the poison, there
is not by definition any threat to life or property.

Mr. Kelley. Mr. Schwarz, I've-been around in this a
a long time. I've-heard a number of threats which were issued,
and they thereafter materialized into actions. I don't think -+
take these threats as being empty ones, because so many times
they have been acted upon.

I was criticized one time when there was a threat made to
kill me, and it was said later on, it's not rhetoric, it's

not rhetoric to me, because when they say they're going to

kill me, that just means one thing.
Mr. Schwarz. But I'm not disagreeing with ‘you.
Mr. Kelley. But you are disagre@ing with me. You're sayand

on the basis of experience that you cannot detect a possible
threat. That's the whole area of concern that we have here, whe
we don't lose the capability of doing something. We don't
say we should initiate ourselves. We say that we should go to
the Attorney General. We do not subscribe to the idea that
we should act independently because maybe we don't have the
judicial review, the capability of determining, but we do
think that we should report it and thereafter see what can
be done.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, have you changed in the course of
our discussion the standard on page 5.

On page 5 you're talking about an imminent threat.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And I hear you now as saying a possible
threat.

Mr. Kelley. An imminent possible threat.

Mr. Schwarz. An imminent possible threat. All right.

Now, would a fair standard for either action, other than
arrest, I don't know what you have in mind, but something to
prevent the person from carrying out his activities, other
than arrest, for instance, what is an example of what you have

in mind?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know what it would be.

Mr. Schwarz. Isolate him in some fashion.

Mr. Kelley. In some fashion perhaps.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, for such activity and for opening
an investigation into a domestic group, could you live with
a standard which said you would have to have an immediate
threat that someone was likely to commit a serious federal
crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. I think that this thing could be worked out
so that there could be an adequate basis for an evaluation.

Mr. Schwarz. So those words, without trying to commit
you entirely to them, do not seem to you to depart far from
what you think would be an acceptable standard.

Mr. Kelley. Well, an imminent, immediate threat might
be, by virtue of the word "immediate" that he's going to
do it the next minute. In that case it may be necessary for
you to, not with the presence or the possibility, not able
to do anything except put him under arrest or anything.

Mr. Schwarz. Of course, of course.

And nobody would at all disagree with that kind of action.

Mr. Kelley. I don't think they would either.

Mr. Schwarz. But on the question, let's take the opening
of an investigation into a domestic group. :

Is it basically consistent with practicality to make the
test immediate threat of a serious Federal crime involving
violence? ‘s

Mr.Kelley. To open a domestic security case.

Mr. Schwarz. Yes.

Mr. Kelley. It appears to me that this is a terrorist
activity, in effect. We certainly have terrorist activities
under our jurisdiction as a threat against the United States.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, are there other circumstances where
it is justifiable to open an investigation of the domestic
group where you do not have an immediate threat of serious
federal crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. Oh, I think there are other criteria, and
they have been well defined as to what is the possible
opening, the basis for a possible opening. We haven't been
discussing that, we have been discussing particular instances,
but there are other criteria that are used, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. What would the other criteria be?

Mr. Kelley. Well, the possible statutory violations
over which we have jurisdiction are, generally speaking, the
most used of thebasis, and then you have, of course, some
intelligence investigations which should, of course, be of

short duration. If there is no showing of this into action

or a viable intent.

Mr. Schwarz. So that's what you're atthe for in the
intelligence investigation?

Mr. Kelley... By intelligence investigation, yes, you
are looking to prevent. oa

Mr. Schwarz. And what you are looking eo cat and
what you're looking to find is a likelihood of action combined
with an intent to take an issue?

Mr. Kelley. And the capability.

Mr. Schwarz. And the capability.

All right. I just have two other lines, Mr. Kelley, and
I appreciate very much your time.

Mr. Kelley. That's all right.

Mr. Schwarz. Assuming a legitimate investigation has -
been started into a domestic intelligence matter, is it legiti-
mate for the FBI, in addition to obtaining information that
relates to what we've just been talking about, the likelihood
of violent action, is it also legitimate for the FBI to
collect, A, retain, B, disseminate, C, information concerning
let's say the sex life of a person on the one hand, and the
political views of a person on the other?

Mr. Kelley. I think, Mr. Schwarz, that this is just what
many of our problems and perhaps the guidelines can define
this type of thing. I think probably you will agree that

within the determination of the deviations possibly of sex

as a determination by guidelines that might be prepared later,
I think that we can certainly deliberate on this to see whether
or not this is something we should retain, and we would not
object to anything reasonable in that regard.

Mr. Schwarz. I just have one final question.

faking the current manual and trying to understand its
applicability laid against the facts in the Martin Luther King
case, under Section 87 there is a -~ permission is granted to
open investigations of the infiltration of non-subversive
groups, and the first sentence reads: "When information is
received indicating that a eee group is seeking to
systematically infiltrate and control a non-subversive. group
or organization, an investigation can be opened." !

Now, .I take it that is the same standard that was used
in opening the investigation of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in the 1960s, so that invéstigation could still be
open today under the FBI manual, the current FBI manual.

Mr. Kelley. We are interested in the infiltration of
clearly subversive groups into non-subversive groups inasmuch
as this is a ploy that is used many times, and having infil-
trated, they then get control, and they have a self-laundered
organization which they can use, and not, certainly, to the
benefit of the country.

Mr. Schwarz. But is the answer to my question yes, that

under that standard, the SCLC investigation could still be

opened today?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Schwarz. All right, then, just one final question.

Do you agree that special care needs to be taken not only
of the standards for initially opening an investigation of a
group, but perhaps extra care needs to be taken when the investil
gation goes beyond the initial target group to individuals
or people who come into contact with it?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know if I agree with that entirely. J]
you mean that we go into the non-subversive group, that we

then investigate people in that non-subversive group, not the

infiltrators, but the non, that we conduct a lengthy investigatijon

of them without any basis for doing so other than that they
are in an infiltrated group, I would likely have said -- but
off the top of my head I would say probably that's not necessary

Mr. Schwarz. Thank you very much,

Mr. Smothers. Just a couple of very brief lines of
inqhiry, Mr.- Kelley.

I think that the questions of the Chief Counsel. was
raising is one that goes further into your statement, when you
talk about the difficulty of setting out the line between

intelligence gathering and law enforcement kinds of functions..

Nevertheless, though, I think that you have made an effort,

indeed, the Bureau's organizational scheme reflects sc: i% 1

to distinguish some of this has been made.

Putting aside for one moment the counterespionage
effort, and looking strictly at what we have ‘been calling the
Domestic Intelligence, is it your view that the retention of
this function in the Bureau is critical to the Bureau's
law enforcement position?

Mr. Kelley. My personal opinion is that the Bureau does

a splendid job in this area. I feel further that the background
of criminal investigatory activities and experiences which ,
all counterintelligence people have is very helpful. It is hel,
ful not only in gathering knowledge and experience, it also
enters into this field, a person with a broad understanding

of the rights and privileges, and you don't have so much that
spy type, that cloak and dagger, that very, very secret type

of an operation.

I subscribe to the present system heartily.

Mr. Smothers. Would it be of assistance to your mission
if within the Bureau guidelines were established that
effectively limited access or controlled dissemination of
the intelligence product? In other words, if we had a
situation where the intelligence product is critical to assist
the law enforcement effort, I don't think there's any question
that there should be access to it.

Isn't our problem one of controlling the use of that
intelligence product and preventing the kind of murky crossing

of lines there with the information legitimately needed for

law enforcement?

Mr. Kelley. There is always a problem when there is wide
dissemination, because that just numerically increases the
possibility of misuse, abuse or Cigaal ganas or anything
of that matter, and I think that it would be well worthwhile
to review the dissemination rules to make them subject to
close guidance in the guidelines that we're speaking of.

Mr. Smothers. Let me just raise one final area with you.

We talked a little bit about, or a question was raised abo
the investigation now being conducted by the Justice Department
regarding the improper actions on the COINTELPRO, and the
King case in particular.

oe we look at allegations of impropriety by your personnel
I think it would be helpful for our record here to have some
insight into the procedure the Bureau would normally follow.

What does the Bureau do when you get an allegation that
an agent or adninistrative official in the Bureau has behaved
improperly?

Is an investigation conducted internally, or is it
routinely referred to the Justice Department?

Mr. Kelley. There may be a revision in this type of
procedure as a result of the establishment of the Council for
Professional Responsibility. At present it would be in the
great majority of the cases turned over to our Investigative

Division for investigation. There might, on some unusual

occasion, be a designation of a special task force made up;
perhaps, of division heads. That is most unlikely, but it is
handled internally at present.

Mr. Smothers. Would these internal determinations be
reviewed by Justice, or do you think that is a necessary
step? :

I guess what we are searching for here is, first of all,

I think you answered that, well, to what extent does the
Bureau police itself, and then secondly, is the Department of
Justice involved in the police determinations?

For instance, what if the Attorney General disagreed with
the assertion that only the higher up officials who ordered
the action against King should be the subject of Gece cdgueion
and maybe prosecution?

How does the interplay work there between you and Justice?

Mr. Kelley. We do report to the Attorney General those
activities which we construe as improper or possibly. illegal.
There is a possibility that the Department, having been advised
of the situation, might take it on their own to do their own
investigating, and this is something that we feel is a
decision to be made only rather rarely, because we feel we
have within our own organization sufficient capability to
handle that. But we do not protest it. It is handled
independently of us.

Mr. Smothers. Thank you.

BY CLARENCE M. KELLEY, DIRECTOR, FBI
BEFORE SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERNAL SECURITY,
SENATE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY , NOVEMBER 19, 1975

An explosion rocked historic Fraunces Tavern in New York City
this January 24; four innocent persons died. Responsibility was claimed by
the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican Liberation, or FALN. This group also claimed
a coordinated series of bombings against Government buildings and corporate
offices in three cities on October 27, 1975.

"This is the face of the terrorist in the United States today--the
twisted rationale of the revolutionary and the urban guerrilla, joined to the
expertise and will to build and explode bombs. "

When we speak of terrorism by various self-proclaimed urban
guerrillas, revolutionaries , and extremist nationalists in this country, we
are talking about violence.

Violence against the Government, against police officers, against
the "system," as some label our society, violence against innocent victims--the
four in New York--violence intended to demonstrate the power of the terrorist,

-in an attempt to show that a free society cannot protect itself and preserve
its freedom at the same time.

The problem of terrorism is, of course, worldwide. Arab

_ terrorists make what amounts to war in their battle for the Middle East.


Kidnappings, bombings, murders, and robberies by urban guerrillas
strained the West German judicial system. In Northern Ireland, terrorism
has become a way of life--and death.

Because there are a number of small terrorist groups spread
across our large Nation, some of them operating in a limited area, we some-
times miss the total impact of their activity. How many Americans have
heard of the New World Liberation Front? This group has claimed at least
fourteen terrorist bombings in California this year alone.

What is the Continental Revolutionary Army? This is the name
used by those who took credit for three bombings in Denver this year--a
Government office, a bank, and the home of a Government official were the
targets.

Other terrorist groups 7 because of their spectacular activities
or their longer presence on the scene, are better known. The SLA, or
Symbionese Liberation Army , received massive publicity after the. kidnapping
of Patricia Hearst--much more attention with this so-called political kidnapping
than with their earlier claim of the murder of the Oakland school superintendent.

The Weather Underground, which started with the name Weatherman,
is still an active terrorist group, claiming the September 5 bombing of the
Kennecott Copper building in Salt Lake City. The Weather Underground,

which recently described itself as a guerrilla organization of communist

‘ : @ @

women and men underground in the United States, claimed four bombings
of Government and corporate targets last year. This group makes no secret
of its intent to wage war, in its words, and then to seize power.

This Subcommittee performed a valuable public service in
publishing its report on the Weather Underground this January.

Your report notes the use of guerrilla manuals by the Weather
Underground. We have found that most terrorist groups use handbooks,
such as the "Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla," that were written abroad,
usually by Marxists.

There is yet a third type of political terrorist in this country.
Besides the extremist nationalists, such as the FALN, and the New Left-
type revolutionaries--the Weather Underground and the New World
Liberation Front--there are the self-described urban guerrillas of the
Black Liberation Army.

Known as the BLA, this group grew out of the Black Panther
Party, after the Panthers split into two factions in 1971. The 1966 formation
of the Black Panther Party itself came at the height of the riots that wracked
our Nation's cities in the 1960's.

This paralleled the development of the New Left on college
campuses, and the escalation of campus disorders to acts of terrorism by the

hard core of this New Left.

NW 55224 DocId:32989807 Page 162

ary .

As early as 1968, the Panthers proclaimed that they would not
dissent from the U. S. Government, they would overthrow it. The armed
Panther invasion of the California legislature gained the group nationwide
notoriety. The Panther antipolice slogan, "off the pig," became reality
when officers were killed in confrontations with Panthers.

Police officers have been the primary target of the urban
guerrilla. Since 1971, the deaths of 43 officers, and the wounding of 152
more, have been linked to these terrorists. The very first communique from
the BLA boasted that the group had "no hangups about dealing with fascist
pig cops."

Letters to the news media claimed credit for two ambush attacks
on police in New York City in May, 1971. Two officers were killed and two
others were wounded in these ambushes.

Attacks on police--12 ambushes, 27 snipings, and 50 other
shooting confrontations--were epidemic in 1971. The police killings in
New York City were the catalyst of a White House Conference on this
emergency. A Presidential order that the FBI render assistance in police-
killing cases, if requested by local authorities, resulted.

At the same time, the FBI was intensively investigating the
BLA. At the end of the year, Frank Fields, a BLA member sought for bank
robbery, fired on FBI Agents seeking to arrest him in Florida. He was

fatally wounded in the shoot-out.

NW 55224 DoclId:32989807 Page 163



The investigation of the 1971 police killings by New York City
police and the FBI was an excellent example of cooperation between local
and Federal authorities in a case that had nationwide ramifications. It
resulted in the conviction of three BLA members this April.

The FBI response to terrorism has included investigations,
training of local police, and research.

Under new bombing laws enacted by Congress, we received
authority to investigate terrorist bombings. We operate the FBI Bomb Data
Program to correlate all bombing matters reported and then inform local
police of tactics and trends in this area.

In 1970, the wave of Weather Underground bombings broke.
The group claimed the bombings of a military facility in May, of the
New York City Police Department headquarters in June, of a bank in New York,
and another military facility in San Francisco, in July.

In response to this violence, we set up nationwide law enforce-
ment training on bombings in the Fall of 1970; some 277 training sessions
were held, attended by thousands of police officers.

While Weatherman-type bombings continued in 1971, these
attacks on property were exceeded in dangerousness by the attacks on the
lives of police officers in 1971 and 1972. The FBI response to these attacks
on police included extensive work on the handling of snipers and nationwide

law enforcement training on this subject.

NW 55224 DocId:32989807 Page i164

In 1973, there was a decline in terrorist-type attacks on police.
There was also a slackening in terrorist bombings--the Weather Underground
claimed only three in 1972 and 1973 together.

We have statistics on terrorist activity in the United States which
I would like to offer for the record at this time. These show some 634 reported
incidents--bombings, fire bombings, ambushes, and other shootings of police,
and other terrorist-type activity--from 1971 through 1974.

We knew, though, that the lull might be only temporary. We
continued assistance to police agencies with symposiums at Quantico and
law enforcement training around the country--almost 25,000 officers attended
the 1973 training sessions. We also began disseminating a periodic summary
of terrorist activity and tactics to police departments.

The decline in attacks on police by members of the Black
Liberation Army has continued. Most of this group's recent activities
have been attempted jailbreaks, in an effort to free some of the BLA leaders
now behind bars.

But bombings by New Left revolutionaries are now on the increase.
In 1973, there were 24 bombings claimed by or attributed to terrorist groups.
Last year, the number of terrorist bombings increased to 45. The first six

months of this year, there were 46 of these bombings, 1 more than all of 1974.

| sw 55224 Docld:32989807 Page 165



New terrorist groups have now appeared. This country has
experienced its first so-called political kidnapping. The activities of the
Symbionese Liberation Army, the self-proclaimed revolutionaries who
recruited among prison inmates, are well known.

Diehard anti-Castro Cuban exiles have, in some cases, turned
to terrorist-type bombings in Miami, other parts of the country, and abroad.
These activities increase with reports of normalization of relations with Cuba.

Law enforcement faces new challenges in combating terrorism.
Terrorists in this country have adopted the cell system to prevent infiltration.
The fanaticism of many of these urban guerrillas and revolutionaries makes
intelligence penetration difficult.

Many terrorists are expert in the use of false identification, and
are able to melt into a whole subculture of communes that extends across the
Nation.

There is also an element of support for today's terrorists, both
moral and material support, from some segments of the American public.
This, to me, is the most difficult aspect of the problem to understand: the
approbation of terrorist activity by otherwise law-abiding citizens, given
apparently because of the so-called idealism of the terrorists.

How does today's terrorism differ from the murderous Ku Klux
Klan violence of a decade ago? While the motives of the terrorists may differ,

motive is of no moment to a murder victim.

NW 55224 DocId:32989807 Page 166

Decent Americans were outraged over Klan bombings, beatings,
and killings. Where is that outrage today?

In spite of this attitude on the part of some people, I still feel
that terrorism is criminal violence, not so-called protest, and must be dealt

with as such.

QUESTION: ++.-You do use informants and do instruct them to
spread dissention among certain groups that they are
informing on, do you not?

MR. ADAMS: We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were
discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably one
of the best examples of a situation where the law was
ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights
used much more than we hear today. We saw with the
Little Rock situation the President of the United States
sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use
local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement
use the troops only as a last resort. When you have a
situation like this where you do try to preserve the
respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical
problems.

With the Klan coming along, we had situations where
the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless
to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some
areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents
mentioned by Mr. Rowe--everyone of those he saw them from the
lowest level--the informant. He didn't see what action
was taken with that information as he pointed out during
his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance.

We also know that in certain instances the infor-
mation upon being received was not being acted upon. We

also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead

memorandum to the Department of Justice the problem.

And here we were--the FBI--in a position where we had no
authority in the absence of an instruction from the
Department of Justice to make an arrest. Section 241
and 242 don't cover it because you don't have evidence
of a conspiracy. It ultimately resulted in a situation
where the Department called in U. S. Marshals who do have
authority similar to local law enforcement officials.

So historically, in those days, we were just as
frustrated as anyone else was, that when we got information
from someone like Mr. Rowe--good information, reliable
information--and it was passed on to those who had the
responsibility to do something about it, it was not always
acted upon as he indicated.

QUESTION: In none of these cases, then, there was adequate
evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to act.

MR. ADAMS: The Departmental rules at that time, and still do,
require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.
Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together.
You can have a mob scene and you can have blacks and whites
belting each other, but unless you can show that those that
initiated the action acted in concert, in a conspiracy, you
have no violation.

Congress recognized this and it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the Civil

Rights Statute which added punitive measures against an

individual. There didn't have to be a conspiracy. This
was a problem that the whole country was grappling with--
the President of the United States, Attorneys General--we
were in a situation where we had rank lawlessness taking
place. As you know from the memorandum we sent you that
we sent to the Attorney General the accomplishments we were
able to obtain in preventing violence and in neutralizing
the Klan and that was one of the reasons.

«---A local town meeting on a controversial social
issue might result in disruption. It might be by hecklers
rather than by those holding the meeting. Does this
mean that the Bureau should investigate all groups
organizing or participating in such meetings because
they may result in violent government disruption?

No sir, and we don't....

Isn't that how you justify spying on almost every
aspect of the peace movement?

No sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we monitor

demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have
an investigative interest in, a valid investigative
interest in, or where members of one of these groups are
participating where there is a potential that they might
change the peaceful nature of the demonstration.

This is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing

on the 1st Amendment right, yet at the same time, being

NW 55224 Docld:32989807 Page 172



- : @ r)
aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers
in the past than we do at the present time. We have had
periods where the demonstrations have been rather severe
and the courts have said that the FBI has the right,
and indeed the duty, to keep itself informed with respect
to the possible commission of crime. It is not obliged
to wear blinders until it may be too late for prevention.
Now that's a good statement if applied in a clear-cut
case.

Our problem is where we have a demonstration and
we have to make a judgment call as to whether it is one
that clearly fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor
the activities. That's where I think most of our disagree-
ments fall.

QUESTION: In the Rowe Case, in the Rowe testimony that we just
heard, what was the rationale again for not intervening when
violence was known about. I know we have asked this several
times--I'm still having trouble understanding what the
rationale, Mr. Wannall, was in not intervening in the Rowe
situation when violence was known.

MR. WANNALL: Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address himself to
that and if you have no objections, I'll ask that he be
the one to answer the question.

MR. ADAMS: The problem we had at the time, and it is the problem
today, we are an investigative agency; we do not have

police powers even like the U. S. Marshals do. The Marshals

NW 55224 DocId:32989807 Page 173



since about 1795 I guess, or some period like that, had
authorities that almost border on what a sheriff has. We
are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice,
and during these times the Department of Justice had us
maintain the role of an investigative agency.

We were to report on activities. We furnished the
information to the local police who had an obligation to
act. We furnished it to the Department of Justice in those
areas where the local police did not act. It resulted
finally in the Attorney General sending 500 U. S. Marshals
down to guarantee the safety of people who were trying to
march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at
a time of Civil Rights versus Federal Rights and yet there
was a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the
country. This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement
agencies in the South at the time either, because many of
them did act upon the information that was furnished to
them. But we have no authority to make an arrest on the
Spot because we would not have had evidence that was a
conspiracy available. We could do absolutely nothing in
that regard. In Little Rock the decision was made, for
instance, that if any arrests need to be made, the Army
should make them. And next to the Army, the U. S. Marshals
should make them--not the FBI, even though we developed

the violations. We have over the years as you know at the

-~-5-

NW 55224 DociId:32989807 Page 174



Time there were many questions raised. Why doesn't the
FBI stop this? Why don't you do something about it? Well,
we took the other route and effectively destroyed the Klan
as far as committing acts of violence and, of course, we

exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

QUESTION: What would be wrong, just following up on your point

there, Mr. Adams, with setting up a program since it is
obvious to me that a lot of our informers are going to
have preknowledge of violence of using U. S. Marshals on

some kind of long-range basis to prevent violence?

MR. ADAMS: We do. We have them in Boston in connection with

the busing incident. We are investigating the violations
under the Civil Rights Act, but the Marshals are in
Boston. They are in Louisville, I believe, at the same
time and this is the approach that the Federal Government

finally recognized.

QUESTION: On an immediate and fairly contemporary basis that

kind of help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting
till it gets to a Boston state. I realize a departure from
the past and not saying it isn't, but it seems to me we need

a better remedy than we have.

MR ADAMS: Well, fortunately we are at a time where conditions have

NW 55224

subsided in the country even from the 60's and the 70's, or
50's and 60's. We report to the Department of Justice on
potential trouble spots around the country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be aware of them. The planning

for Boston, for instance, took’ place a year in advance, with
state officials, city officials, the Department of Justice

and the FBI sitting down together saying "How are we going to
protect the situation in Boston"? I think we have learned a
lot from the days back in the early 60's. But, the Government
had no mechanics which protected people at that. time.

Next I would like to ask, back in 1965, I guess during
the height of the effort to destroy the Klans as you put it
a few omens ago, I believe the FBI has released figures that
we had something like 2,000 informers of some kind or another
infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10,000 estimated member-
ship.

That's right.

I believe these are FBI figures or estimates. - That would
mean that 1 out of every 5 members of the Klan at that point
was an informant paid by the Government and I believe the
figure goes on to indicate that 70 percent of the new members
in the Klan that year were FBI informants. Isn't that an
awful overwhelming quantity of people to put in an effort such
as that? I'm not criticizing that we shouldn't have informants
in the Klan and know what is going on to revert violence but it
just seems to me that the tail is sort of wagging the dog. For
example today we supposedly have only 1594 total informants,
both domestic informants and potential informants. Yet, here
we have 2,000 in just the Klan alone.

Well, this number of 2,000 did include all racial matters

and informants at that particular time and I think the figures

NW 55224 Docld:32989807 Page 176 -7-


we tried to reconstruct as to ‘the actual number of Klan
informants in relaton to Klan members was around 6 percent, I
think after we had read some of the testimony on it. Isn't that
right, Bill? Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan
had a group called the Action Group. This was the group if you
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony that he was left out of in
the beginning. He attended the open meetings and heard all the
hoorahs and this type of information but he never knew what was
going on because each one had an Action Group that went out and
considered themselves in the missionary field. Theirs was the
violence. In order to penetrate those you have to direct as
many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in mind
that I think the newspapers, the President, Congress, everyone,
was concerned about the murder of the three civil rights
workers, the Lemul Penn case, the Violet Liuzzo case, the
bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one
tremendous problem at that time.

QUESTION: I acknowledge that.

MR. ADAMS: Our only approach was through informants. Through the
use of informants we solved these cases. The ones that were
solved. There were some of the bombing cases we never solved.
They're extremely difficult, but, these informants as we told
the Attorney General and as we told the President, we moved
informants like Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the
bodyguard to the head man. He was in a position where he

could see that this could continue forever unless we could

NW 55224 DocId:32989807 “Page 177 -8-



create enough disruption that these members will realize that
if I go out and murder three civil rights, even though the
Sheriff and other law enforcement officers are in on it, if
that were the case, and in some of that was the case, that I
will be caught, and that's what we did, and that's why violence
stopped because the Klan was insecure and just like you say

20 percent, they thought 50 percent of their members ultimately
were Klan members, and they didn't dare engage in these acts of
violence because they knew they couldn't control the conspiracy
any longer.

QUESTION: I just have one quick question. Is it correct that in
1971 we were using around 6500 informers for a black ghetto
situation?

MR ADAMS: I'm not sure if that's the year. We did have a year
where we had a number like that of around 6000 and that was
the time when the cities were being burned. Detroit, Washington,
areas like this, we were given a mandate to know what the
situation is, where is violence going to break out next. They
weren't informants like an individual that is penetrating an
organization. They were listening posts in the community that
would help tell us that we have another group here that is
getting ready to start another fire fight or something.

QUESTION: +.. Without going into that subject further of course we
have had considerable evidence this morning where no attempt
was made to prevent crime when you had information that it
was going to occur. I am sure there were instances where
you have,

We disseminated every single item which he reported to us.

To a police department which you knew was an accomplice to

Not necessarily knew.

Your informant told you that, hadn't he?

The informant is on one level. We have other informants
and we have other information.

You were aware that he had worked with certain members of
the Birmingham Police in order...

That's right. He furnished many other instances also.

So you really weren't doing a whole lot to prevent that
incident by telling the people who were already a part of it.

We were doing everything we could lawfully do at the
time and finally the situation was corrected when the Department
agreeing that we had no further jurisdiction, sent the U.S.
Marshals down to perform certain law enforcement functions.

.-.-This brings up the point as to what kind of control
you can exercise over this kind of informant and to this
kind of organization and to what extent an effort is made to
prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing
that you were supposedly trying to prevent. ;

A good example of this was Mr. Rowe who became active in
an Action Group and we told him to get out or we were no longer
using him as an informant in spite of the information he had
furnished in the past. We have cases, Senator where we have had

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We did not tell him to, participate in violent activities.

That's what he said. ,

I know that's what he says, but that's what lawsuits
are all about is that there are two sides to issues and our
Agent handlers have advised us, and I believe have advised your
staff members, that at no time did they advise him to engage
in violence.

Just to do what was necessary to get the information.

I do not think they made any such statement to him
along that line either and we have informants who have gotten
involved in the violation of a law and we have immediately
converted their status from an informant to the subject and
have prosecuted I would say off hand, I can think of around
20 informants that we have prosecuted for violating the laws
once it came to our attention and even to show you our policy
of disseminating information on violence in this case during
the review of the matter the Agents have told me that they
found one case where an Agent had been working 24 hours a
day and he was a little late in disseminating the information
to the police department. No violence occurred but it showed
up in a file review and he was censured for his delay in
properly notifying local authorities. So we not only
have a policy, I feel that we do follow reasonable safeguards
in order to carry it out, including periodic review of all
informant files.

Mr. Rowe's statement is substantiated to some extent with

an acknowledgment by the Agent in Charge that if he were going

to be a Klansman and he happened to be with someone and they
decided to do something, he couldn't be an angel. These are
words of the Agent. And be a good informant. He wouldn't
take the lead but the implication is that he would have

to go along or would have to be involved if he was going

to maintain his liability as a ---

MR. ADAMS: There is no question that an informant at times will

have to be present during demonstrations, riots, fistfights
that take place but I believe his statement was to the

effect that, and I was sitting in the back of the room and I do
not recall it exactly, but that some of them were beat with
chains and I did not hear whether he said he beat someone with
a chain or not but I rather doubt that he did, because it is
one thing being present, it is another thing taking an

active part in a criminal action.

QUESTION: It's true. He was close enought to get his throat cut
apparently.
QUESTION: How does the collection of information about an

individual's personal life, social, sex life and becoming
involved in that sex life or social life is a requirement for

law enforcement or crime prevention.

MR. ADAMS: Our Agent handlers have advised us on Mr. Rowe that

NW 55224

they gave him no such instruction, they had no such knowledge
concerning it and I can't see where it would be of any

value whatsoever.

_Mr. Church’

-: By William Safire

WASHINGON, Noy. 18—On Oct. 10,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put his personal signa-
ture on a document that launched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-
_ dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century. :

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-

mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in.
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.
, With great care, the committee has
focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when*
the committee counsel first set forth
the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-}
partment had existed in 1962; today,
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robert Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed
-their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.”

But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nedy root of this precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask therm some
questions that have gone unasked for
thirteen years,

For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wiretap Dr, King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.. know the ;
President was consulted or informed?

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-!
fice, and the wiretapping continued, ;
he was told by angry newsmen that
the F.B.L was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr. King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis«
‘continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony -
would erode Senator Church’s political
base. That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha
(Deke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnson's
personai contact with the F.B.I. in the
witness chair. What did President
Johnson know about the character-
assassination plot and when did he
know it? What conversations took
place hetween Mr. Deloach and Presi-
dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.
King, or about the use of the F.B.i. in
auy other intrusions into the lives of

S gover-Up

: —

The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are ‘readily available. A. couple of
weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.B.l. man inadvertently started to
biurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 wit
the apparent knowleage of Attorne:
General Kennedy, The too-willing wit!
ness was promptly shooshed into si

lence, and told that such informatio:
would be developed only in executive

+ session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern of containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and. Democratic con-

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson, Such invasions of politi-
cai headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, sirice
they involved the use of the “F.B.I.,
but the Church investigators seem to
be determinetl not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.1. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com:
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.I. to spy on political
opponents, who can be’ brought for.
ward to tell us all about it?

But that_ would cause embarrass: _
ment to Democrats, and Senator *
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee’s hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes 2 or

ly—and nobody demands to know
which network executive made what
decision under what pressure. i

Y have been haranguing patient’
readers for years about the double
standard applied to Democratic and~*
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would be laid
before the public in damning detail.

Obviously, Democrat Frank Church
is not the man to do it. His. jow!-
shaking indignation is all too selec-
tive; the trail of high-level respon
bility for the crimes committed against
Dr. King and others is evidently going
to be allowed to cool,

Pity, You'd think that after all the
nation has been through in the past
few years, our political leaders would
have learned that the one. thing that
brings you down is the act of covery
