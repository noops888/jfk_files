room for much improvement. Chief ALLEN has held several

police schools during the past three years and the FBI

participated In each of these schools.

ALLEN 1s interested

in promoting police efficiency, but lacks organizational

ability and does not hold full

respect of his men. There

trying to get their own man in a key position,
