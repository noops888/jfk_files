Investigation and contacts with informants and
sources of information have failed to give any indication
that there are any organized gangs in Broward County at the
present time,

On November 15, 1956, MM 322-C advised that neither
MEYER LANSKY, FBI No. 791783, nor VINCENT ALO have been in
Hollywood, Florida, during the past six months, He indicated
that ALO has become more alligned with activities in New York
since the deportation of JOE ADONIS to Italy. Informant ~~

the local press reported a raid on th/ferae caw, Orlando,
Florida and from this raid 1t was indicated the football
pool had links to the Daytona io area,

MM 572C advised JOHN IARDUCCI, Ormond Beach,
Florida 1s handling football bets and horse bets. NARDUCCI
assists in the operation offMalph's Cocktail Lounge,
Ormond Beach, Florida.

C, POLITICAL TIE-UPS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME rhe

MM 572C reports Constable JAME: INCHEN is
being paid off by JACK BUTLER in order for BUTLER to operate
in the colored section of town.

.D, POLICE EFFICIENCY

kur

. . H.~ LEROY ALLEN is Chief of Police and his department
Gonsists of some fifty-five men, The Detective Bureau has

been headed in the past by ALVA G, LAYNE, but LAYNE

retired as of November 1, 1956 and a ‘successor has not

yet been appointed, -

Public reaction to the efforts of the police has
become more favorable, but all seem to agree that there is
room for much improvement. Chief ALLEN has held several
police schools during the past three years and the FBI
participated in each of these schools. ALLEN is interested
in promoting police efficiency, but lacks organizational
ability and does not hold full respect of his men. ‘There
are several different factions within the department, each
trying to get their own man in a key position,

The Daytona Beach Police Department and the
Volusia County Sheriff's Office and the troopers of the ~
Florida Highway Patrol in this area are most cooperative fe
with FBI and go all out to aid or assist the Bureau in
its work. . .

1 E. GAMBLING
MM 316C, MM 618¢C, MM 572C, MM 431C, MM 437¢ and
MM 316C report there no open gambling houses in Volusia

County, Florida. There are sneak games held at the Moose
Club and the Elks Club, but the tain type of gambling here
