UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Chicago, Illinois

February

19, 1964

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA;

DOMINICK EDWARD BARTONE;

ET AL.

Robert Comeissner, 312-

Binsdale,

Illinois.

appeared "at

"the Chicago Office of

Princeton the Federal

Bureau of Investigation on february 1& 7964 shortly

after he had a brief meeting with Joseph Verhelle, in

911.

Chicago, and furnished the following intormation:

Terari

He has been talking

to Verhelle by telephone

on an average of two or three

times a week for the past

month or so.

During these conversations, Verhelle

mentioned that four people would probably testify for the

defense at the Chattanooga trial of Hoffa and if these

people testified he, Verhelle, would also probably

have to testify.

The testimony was believed to introduce

in the Hoffa trial that the Justice Department would

stop at nothing to get Hoffa,

refer to the situation at the Public Bank of Detroit

which was ruined by the fact that a horde of examiners

came into the bank which caused Verhelle to leave the

2322e

and as an example, would

bank with the result that the inefficient new management

caused the bank's downfall. Verhelle blames the Justice,

Department for ruining the Public Bank.

Verhelle mentioned today that a State of Michigan

Banking Commissioner went to Washington, possibly recently,

and visited the Justice Department and talked to the

Attorney General and let it be known that he believed

the

Justice Department was carrying on a vendetta against

Hoffa which, in turn, caused the persecution of the

Public Bank

of Detroit.

No identities of new potential defense witnesses

were mentioned by Verhelle, however, Verhelle stated that

it was decided that he now would not testify in Chattanooga.

Re:

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; Etc.

Meissner got the impression, however, that someone will

probably testify as to the Public Bank of Detroit situation

to show that the government is going all out against Hoffa

and it could be possible the above mentioned

Banking

Commissioner will be the person to testify.

Chicago F

He and Verhelle met with Robert in Colers oftice,

realty firm of Hogan and farwel,

today, regarding the possible purchase of the Sinclair

Building in Chicago.

Cole told them that the New York

Life Insurance Company could not take a parellel

mortgage on this building, therefore, it appears there

will be no further action

on the purchase of the

building by Verhelle or himself. Cole also mentioned

a New York City building which he did not identify in

which Verhelle expressed

an interest and Verhelle is'to

recontact Cole in the next week or two. Verhelle also

mentioned to Cole that if other properties having a good

yield were located, that he, Verhelle, would buy them.
