Niarchos' ship captains named Katopodes brought a libel action

I believe it was, against Onassis for some letter he had written

about some activities of Katapodes, I can't remember the

details now.

We didn't know where this was leading. So this was in

the Supreme Court of New York State, and so I went to a fellow

I knew in the U.S. Attorney's office and asked him if he

could keep track of how this suite was developing to see if

it was leading into some of the connections we had, par-

ticularly with Niarchos.

And he got some of the pleadings and some of the pre-

trial evidence --

Mr. Wides. But you don't recall any contacts between

the Agency and the Justice Department resulting in MI. Yeagley

going up to try and halt some aspects of the grand jury

proceedings in New York growing out --

Mr. Houston. : It strikes no valve.

Mr. Wides. Let me ask just one more question in this

area and then we will move on to the document I asked you to

look at before we started.

Mr. Maxwell.

Mr. Wides

I have just one other question.

The SEC, as a result has raised some questions with Justice

between our justice and our statutory problems. This is

before Justice now.

Mr. Wides. Is there a file in the OGC office generally

regarding, not necessarily every one, but many of your --

which would contain many or most of OGC contacts with

Administrative agencies over the years?

MI. Houston. No, because they weren't -- there probably

is a substantial file on relations with Internal Revenue.

But those were to a large part either working out our own

tax equations on our own personnel with cover problems which

you probably know about, or the CAT situation, or Southern

Air Iransport, and not interferring with IRS prosecutions,

although several times we were involved -- here is the type of

case I guess you are talking about.

What is the fellow out in the Philippines -- I think his

name is

— who had one of the biggest tax assess-

ments made against an individual made against him, I think,

$2 million?

And I

very definitely tried to involve

us in his defense.

There was some connection with

in the Philippines, you couldn't be in the Philippines without

some connection with them. And yet gave IRS the full in-

formation, and said, don't bother with us, we are not

concerned.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr.

Houston.

To go back to the start -- it may have

already been

the OGC office

told -- back in the last fifties we found in

that the hardest thing to cope with

were bene-

fits for death

disability insured under covert

circumstan-

ces, particularly

when, as so often happened, no

prior planning

had been made for this.

Even the prior planning is diffi-

cult, because if you are going to put an agent into certain

circumstances, and say you will get him

insurance through

Mutual of Omaha, if the circumstances

ox the Department are

later known to Mutual of Omaha,

they might say, well, that

is not a risky cover, and continually you wouldn't have

your insurance.

So, we came to the conclusion that we needed our own in-

surance business, and we started by buying two very small

off-shore insurance companies, and started writing death and

health policies. Now,

the business grew quitel capialy to

cover all sorts of covert operations. And we went to two

large outside insurence companies and asked if they would

• cooperate and take

some of the policies either on a

fully

pro-

tected basis

from us, or if they saw fit, for their own account.

And both of

them did both. They would take some risks for

their own account, and the only thing we would ask is that

they

protect the investigation in case it got into sensitive

fields.

to bring up their ideas for investments, particularly in the

stock field, until more recent years. But mainly we were

they could

give on basic invest-

there was income from funds and

dividends - until the stock

market broke there were some capital

gains registered. Then

the investment policy went more and

more, particularly as

the interest rate went up,

the Eurobonds and certificates

of deposit, where for a while you were

getting -- I think we

got a weighted average of over l1 percent.

And then those

would go back into the fund against the insurance loss account-

The most

difficult thing we had was trying to

decide what was enough, because there was no actuarial exper-
