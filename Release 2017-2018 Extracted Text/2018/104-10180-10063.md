1. For your information, I am Filiberto Rivero. I an a citizen

of Cuba by birth; born 29 Aug 1913, and a permanent resident of the US

since 1949. I au mrried to an American, have an Aberican daughter, sad

I've lived in California practically since I arrived in the US, except

for two or three short visita to Cuba prior to 1959. Al present I have

no political artiliations elther in 0ibe or elserbere, and I du not belong

to any organizations whatsoever.

For a time, bowever, I vas President of

the Cuban Catholic Center in Los Angeles, an archdiocesan orgunization

created to provide Cuban refugees with a place to meet, and help each

other find jobs, ete.

About four gears ago I started & lecture tour, prompted by

people like the Kivanio, Chambers of Comnerce, etc., to try to explain

the Cuban situation.

For the last two yeare I have bad a radio program

on Station MAW, Pasadena, Sundays, 1900-1930.

It's a sort of nevacant

of Latin America called "Nuestra America al Dia", or "Our America to

Unte". In that program I do a kind of resume of the important evente

of the week in latin America, concentrating on Cuba.

headlines wich of the time, legitimately in important neva and is the

source of Important news; also I'm extremely interested in the problema

I should also say that I am a strong believer in the

American system of government and wish that my little country could

have done as well, l.e., had a two-party aystem with elections every

four years, after which

they would bury the political hatchets and go

to work.

But it hasn't worked out like that.

I have strong views on

some points of Averican politics.

a Republican I would be a

Liberal Republican; If I was a Democrat I would be a Conservative

Democrat.

That's as close as I can describe my political thinking.

One final thing, I have never been in jail and I've never been in

any trouble.

3. Now with that little background I should add that I have been

the only radio or TV voice in los Angeles attempting to explain the upa

and downs of latin Arerican politics and this has fiven me a bit of

recognition. Also since October 1964 on Monday nights, fro 2100 to

3400, I have had a program With A Mexican, Roberto Iglesias, who 18

an American citizen by convenience, in my opinion, that is, and not

by conviction, although we are friends. We started a program of

telephone conversations in which people would call and comment on

any subject on polities - national, local, or latin American -- as

they plessed.

This program, which is also on MitH, has enjoyed &

l'antastic and unexpected success, and it brought me to some additional

prominence in the latin community of Los Angeles. I might say 1t

bas also unde me a center of controveray. I've taken done strong

swipes at the Mexican Government because it did not go along with

the reat of America in breaking relntions with Castro. By the same

token, I have also taken some rather strong avipea at certain areas.

Of the American Government for things done in Latin Averica that I

feel vere grave mistakes.

4. I consulted beforehand, hovever, vith a number or people

on a personal basis to know 1f I had the riebt to discuss American

politics, since I am not an Anerican citizen. I vas told that this

was a free country, and that as long as I dida't violate any lava

of the country I could speak on anything I pleased, and that 1t

would be judged in regard to good taste, or bad taste; but not that

I was doing anything illegal.

So, being respectful of American laws,

I've taken advantage of the fact that I live in a free country, one

I like very much, because I think I'm doing some good.

5.

With reference to the Mexican community, in general, It's a

matter of orienting a million and a half people who were born with

a hatred of the us.

Hoot of those that come here from Mexico have

been brought up with a deep-seated resentment against the Yankee.

Our program has shown thie to be tremendously strong and I make a

special effort to tell them that the cause of their woes is not the

Yankee; 1t'g their own lack of education because their sovernment

for many years has kept them in a kind of an intellectual serfdom.

So, I'm not popular with many Mexicans, who accept whatever their

government says is good for them.

I argue that you do not accept

the word of the goverment as the word of God; that you discuss

and argue with your governuent if you don't agree, and that is what

keepa the administration on

its toes.

This to not the way it works

in Mexico which 18 not a denocracy, but a kind of & civilian monarchy

In which the monarch or the king changes every six years, but the

monarchy reigas on, that 18, the Partido Revolucionairo Institucional,

the PRI. So much for Mexico.

Now, regarding Cuba.

The reason I wanted to have a chat with

you 1s because there is somsthing imminent as far as Los Angeles 18

concerned, and due to our f'ricndly relations I vant to intorm you

beforehand so that you would know from me and not from the press.

I refer to the fact that we're trying to create what will amount to

a Cuban Government in exile.

This is aot news because it has been

going on for about three or four months, but what is laportant 1s

that I have jumped the gun on the leaders in Miant, and am scheduling

down the second and third waves that were origiually scheduled.

The

Information I beard from other sources is that there vas a very heated

argument between Adlal Stevenson and President Kennedy.

Stevenson had

gone on record that the firet wave of bombers that hit Cuba prior to

the Invasion vere flown by defectore from the Cuban Air Force.

Apparently he did not know that this was part of the overall CIA

operation. When be learned of this, I'a told, he got very, very

upset, being a san of great pride, and that in his rather strong

argument vito President Kennedy about the point, be threatened to

reveal the whole piot 1n Iront of me vorld and lesian as Anbassador

to the United Nationg 1º tbere were any dore such bombings. I under

stand President Kennedy feared a scandal, and gave the orders that

resulted in the Bay of Piga disaster. 'I don't know if this 1a true

or not but I put it here because 1t makes a lot of sense and tenda

to relieve the American Intelligence groups of the blame they"re been

carrying on their sboulders since the Bay of Pigs invasion, but that's

beside the point.

8.

The next big soment of Cuban hope of liberation was the

October 1962 missile crisis.

We all know what happened there, and

many of us Cubans feel that the aduinistration made another frave

aistake because rany very important people in the adainistiation

do not understand tbe mechanics of the Communist mind. At the time

in which

the so-ralled eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation came about

the Soviets pronised to take the missiles out, and to permit some

interrational organization to inspect the island, etc.

Of course,

the question 1s -- why did the Averican lovernment retreat or lift

the blockade when the moment of danger had already passed? I under-

stand that many people in Hachington and the administration felt

that Khrushcher had behaved like a good boy, had promised he would

take his missiles out impediately, and disarntle them, and that be

should not be pushed into a corner.

It was felt that if he was pubed

into a cornes, possibly the Stalinist group in the USSR, prodded by

the Chinese, would overthrow Khrushchey, and then the US would have

to deal with a much tougher man and not good old Nikita who wasn't

too hard to get along with. All he had done vas point a fev atomic

missiles at our beads.

In any event, ve Cubans felt that if the

blockade had been kept on for another few weeks, or until the inspec

tion bad been made, this vould have been ao brutally shamcfui to the

Castro regime that right then and there, chances were good for an

Internas uprising while the United Nations or the OAS or the Red

Cross was there making ite inspection. At any rate, this vas a

fantastic upportunity that ma migard is sennons which perbaps

history may be able to take care of. So, that was second insug

that talled In the Cuben problem.

9.

Toen, of course,

we can also mention the disaster of Miro

Cardona and his group which failed in the opinion of uny people

because they were practically appointed by the State Departuent.

At least, at that time, the State Tonertment scewed to want some

left-wing lesders to take over Cuba.

There Is no doubt that Cardona

could be clesalfied as a Socialist of sorto, or left-winger of sorts.

The disaster of Cardona was a result of the Bay of Pigs situation and

was & very unpleasant thing.

I think personally that Cardon conducted

bimself wrong.

If be had been brought into President Kennedy's confi-

dence, he should have respected that confidence and made a discreet

exit,

but not the big to-do he made which didn't accomplish anything

except to kill the hopes of other Cubans and to make President Kennedy

and Robert Kennedy very angry.

Anyway, Cardona's group had the original

oin of not being a legitimate

Cuban organization. Moreover, there 10

another thing about his group which many Cubans have never forgiven

that is tiat at the moment of the invasion they were practically locked

up by American authorities someplace in Florida. They vere supposed

to be allies but vere kept prisoners. I suspect the truth of the

matter is that the Americans who were running the show feared these

Cubans would talk too much and that their veing put away for a few

hours was just a roughshod way of protecting them against themselves.

But this left a bad taste because it proved that the croup was nothing

but a puppet of the State Department, and Cubans proud of their

sovereigrts and their nationalism didn't like 1t at all.

10.

The next point on the things that have gone wrong in the

process of Cuban liberation 16 lie fantestin "operetta", and I say

operetta because we could call :: a tracic conedy, of Manolo Ray

and his meanderings around te Caribbean.

I had been In Washington

In March 1964 and in Miani In awary or Febrary 19% and I had

done a lot. of talking, and Interrewine, and investlgnting. When I

returned to los Angeles, abors April 19th, I gave a meeting of Cubana

• full report of my three-mon. trip on the referendum preparationa

doing on

1n Miant, aod my conversations In Washington with some State

Departuent people, With-Cuban ex ambassadors who still live In Washing

ton and a tremendous assortsent of personalities.

During my report,

Los Angeles, one of the Cuban

cold hiu uithout any hesitation (and I have a tape of that meting)

that there was nothing to be concerned about or hoped for with Ray

because he was

going to be on sose convenient little island in the

Caribbean with a photographer and a few Iriends and that would be the

end of hio promioe to invade Cuba.

But I was promptly abused by a

member of the Junta (JURE) because be thoupht I was desecrating his

hero.

I told him I didn't have anything against Ray but that I had

enough incormation to warrant so sajing mat.

Of course, when this

actually happened just a few weeks later when Ray was discovered on

Cay Angulla,

a British possessics, I was looked on with great respect

by the people at that meeting.

My reasoning that Ray was going to be

found on an 1sland was juat the result of putting a low bits of inforca

tion together and aoking mysels shy Ray had made the rash promise in

1903 that he vould be fighting in Cuba or be killed in the fighting.

This was because of his famous, or Infanuus, scheme known as the

Judas plan.

The Judas plan to

refrest you vas one whereby the American

Governuent (when I say governbeat I mean precisely Robert Kernedy and

perhape his brother) was to oversarov Castro just before the elctions

of 1954.

It came to be called ice Judas plan because actually it was

not meant to change the casie type of governuent, juot to replace

Fidel Custro With Manolo Ray.

Frose of' us who studied Ray wondered

how much diiference there would be in the basic polltical philosophy

of Castro and Ray. I think thai ve can sa, without miesing the mack

too far that Ray would find a lot of support for this kind of thinking

1n soDe circles of the State Departoent and the American Governuent.

Then I had another reason to trini toat this Judas plan was real because

during my stay in Miami I learned toat severai top officials of the

first nine months oi the Casiro soverspect, by then returees themselves,

had been contacted by people connected in sont way with others supposed

This whole operation 1s very involved, vould require bours so

explain.

It was dubbed by many the Judas plan because Judas was tbe

apostle who betrayed his lord.

So, let'a go on to the next polat.

• Britten to let

Ilo Ray floundered and was caught on Cay Anguila, In the Babanas,

a British possession, and as ve all know he was fined for sowething

or other and let loose. Since that time we haven't heard much exceyt

In los Angelec, Jose Estever, the JURE delegate, took an onth that Ray

was already in Cube. Later, when Ray was discovered in Cay Anguila,

Estever told his own executive group he had lied so that they wouid

not lose their enthusiass. The people who had been with Ray in Los

Angeles told Estevez that If lying was a way of life for JURs they

would back out, that they had left Cuba because Castro had led to

them, and that they were not soing to take any vore lles fros any-

body.

This was the end of JRs and I have their document which 15

He's fed,

the lack of besitation in the Vietnan situation. It

may interest you to know that a group of Cubans from RECS recently in

Washington were told by imporzant people in no uncertain terns that

the Cuban problem is certainly not top draver right now, but second,

third or fourth.

The top draser is Vietnam and that once Vietnon 1s

solved one way or another, per.aps the Cuban situstion would be moved

up to the forefront, 1f no other area of the world flares up.

19.

So, this 1s the situstion that brings us right down to

the point which I wanted to discuss with you in detail • le formation

o1 a Cuban Government In Exile as the only possible solution to nove

the Cuban situstion off dead center, whether the US Governsen: 1s

willing at this tibe to help or not.

We feel that the creaston of a.

Cuban Government in Exile, 1f done

right and has the soral authority

and the solld backing of the Cuban exiles, could possibly creste a

situation where, without having to riok any American lives, the Cuban

problem and the Communist thres: in Cuba could be eliainated without

danger of World War III, or escalation, or anybody dropping the fabous

bomb in New York or Washington.

I sn going to tell you vay a group

of people, including mysell, tellere very strongly tat this govern..

ment in exile should be made as soon as possible, and an vell ag

possible. And the fact that if it vere a lait accompli it rould

create some drastic changes in so thinking of the State Dejerement

regarding a Cuban Government in äxile.

2U.. The beginning of the idea of a government in exile started

at an OAS meeting in lashington in July 1yó4 when Dr. Prio ard Dr.

Marque: Sterling capitalized on tieir personal, old friends.ipa

with the present Secretary oi State of Brazil, Vasco Leftao Da Cunha,

and 8l80 the ex-ambassador of Argentina, Jullo Aboedo, to further

these ideas. Both the latter had been ambassadors to Cuba during

the Prio regine and tbere vere strong tles between thea.

At tho

time of this conference in duly 1964, apparently Prio convinced

Leitao and Anoedo lost the idea of a Cubun Governent in Exile

would be a solution to the Cuban problem. Bra:il still had fresh

1n 1ts mind the borrible scare of going Communist, and Lestao 18

He offered Prio a place to gatier in

Brazil for most of the Cuban leaders (and he knew them al1). The

List of people to be invited to Brazil contained all the top leadera

• In exile. I can give you their names but I think 1t vould be just

academic because the gathering did not take place.

This proposal

created tremendous excitement among the Cuban exiles and of course

Pilo mentioned it as the basis for his enthusiasm in creating a

government in exile. Dr. Prio felt that 1f Brazil, shich 18 tbe

largest nation in Latin America, and the most popular with the US,

especially now that it has a friendly government, would recognize

the Cuban Governent in Exile and give it a temporary bone toere

that this vould persuade the US to cooperate in some say or another.

The fact 1s that recently the Brazilian authorities turned down Dr.

Prio, much to his sorrow.

The information I have 1s that there were

soDe very strong pressured exerted by the State Departmeat on the

Brazilian Government against the idea of cooperating with Dr. Prio

or any of his friends, in creating a Cuban Governuent in Exile.

Just a feu daya ago in Miami, Mi, Leiteo told Dr. Prio, and tale

18 very reliable inside intoration, that If' he had gone shead with

the original plans of inviting Prio and other Cubana to 8raz1l, he

might have lost his job.

21. Incidentally, yesterday I had a very interesting tidult

which I don't know is true or not. Perhaps tomorrow it will be all

academle, but I was told that Prio and leiteo would have one last

secret meeting in Houston, Texas, where Mrs. Lestao 18 taking, BoDe

kind of medical treatment. So perhaps this la not cumpletely dead

vet or maybe Leitao wants

to appear as trying to inolat some sore

I don't know, but 1t 1a Interesting.

22. Anyway, after the Brazilian turn-down, the Mieni leadership

vas staggered.

No one knew what to do next or whom to tali to.

Apparently the Cuoar leaders felt that unless they had une support

of a latin American country they would not be able to yo arcad with

their government in exile idea.

23.

As a result of soberbing that happened sore recently, I

have real hopes.

In the isst few days, perhaps you have heard,

there bas an unbelievable plebiscite hold in Miaal first, then in

Los Angeles, and sea li New York and Puerto Rico, in which people

vere just invited ly a comictoe of vomen to come to certain places

and express themselves on a llitle card on whether they vanted a

sovernment in exile to de formed. Well, the reaction vas un-

believable.

I fare out oniy ino small announcerents on my radio

program, and me had aloost 5000 people come to Eullywood and Vine

on a rainy, cold arternoon to deposit their little postcards saying

"tie vant a governent in exile."

Miami had close to 50 thousand

do the same.

New York had over 50 thousand people. Puerto Rico

bad another 10 or 15 chousand.

In other words, it was a spontaneous,

legitimate reaction of the Cuban public in favor of having some kind

of an orsanization to represent them in their exile.

As a result of this informal plebiscite, ve've resolved

In los Angeles to inore the impasse that had come about in the

lesdership in Miami, to igore tbe difficulties and complications

and all the things that people told un would be impossible in

having a government in exile vicbout the support of the US, and go

shead. And this is the main reason for my visit with you tonight.

The idea, incidentally, or a fovernment in exile my mise some

hackles

In the State Departeen: but from a purely legal point of

view, I feel, and I have no resson to believe the contrary,

that the

Cubane 1a extie here are not violating any law of the US - federal,

state or local - because what they are doing at this time is running

an election to determine

the opinion of 200 thousand-300 thousand

people as to whom tiey think sbould take over the leadership of the

exiles.

Until such tine as those elected declare themselves a

government in exile there would be no conflict with US laws.

Pernaps at that tina, once these people are elected and accept

tue election, they can then discuss this point with the state

Department. If the Stato Departsent tells them that if they declara

ciencelves a governaent in exile that thej're going to jall, then

all they have to du is fiod ou: If Costa Rica will take them, or El

salvador, or Brazil, or whatever. Of course, they and we know that

must of these countries are strungly dependent upon US aid and loans,

and so fortn, jor their operation and there 1a no doubt in my mind

trat 1t 18 going to cake 1 littie persuasion to fet a latin American

country to defy the lS and fire shia government in exile a piece of

land and recogaition..

But there is an alternative which ve have

considered and this is that these nen who will be elected in this

proceas do not necessarlly bare to declare tremselves a governaent

1n exile. They could declare themselves, to be some kind of a

leadership junta, or a presaratory committee or wintever, to avoid

any legal problems witb

the State Department of the us.

25. There has been • I belleve I mentioned it before - a

tremendous amount of floundering by the leadere 1n Minmi after tbe

Brazilian denial of a meeting place in Rio de Janeiro and a group

of un in California, and frankly I have been the prive instigator

1n this, have decided not to walt for the people in Miami, but to

go ahead and start an election in California to sce how it vorke

out.

I con assure you that in the planning of thie whole election

¿bere have been no participantà except a number of us Cubans a11

of whom I think are in good faith and who may not be leaders but

are intelligent and well meaning. So, we decided to start here

1n. Callfornia where, incidentally, the passions of politice are not

as vehement.

In Miami, the people are intense in their political

passions and their brains are clouded.

For Instance, about five

or Bix days ago, I called Dr. Eduardo Suarez Grivas, who is the

pover behind Prio's political machinery.

All the meetings are held

1n his bouse

and he is the real brains of this whole thing.

This

man was a Cuban senator for some lU years and one of the most active

Ing sowething

that would be good for Cuba because, if 30, ve wouldn't

do 1t.

could possibly upset sowething else, le would refrain.

lic asked me

to wait a few days because something was going on but I learned from

other sources that the situation down there was alsost chaotic so we're

going ahead.

what are we going, to do?

Well, thie is the atory;

ve call it the California Plan.

We are going,

to hold an election

on April 25th -= that's about four weeke fron now roughly - that

will Eive us plenty of tiac. The vechanice are these: We will

1n'o1te every Cuban in the Los Angeles area to come to one of 15 to

25 predetermined polling places throughout the city and surrounding

Breas where we know that there are a number of Cubans. We think

that we will be able to use the International Institute on Foyle

Street, the CYO bullding in East Los Angeles,

Including the Bleused Sacrubent here 1u Hollywood, & number of

Masonic remples, the Knithts of Columbus hall downtown at Fonnie

In each polling place there will be a looselear regioter

We will meet

They will give us guidance on

After the person identifies himself and

31. To help people's nemories we will provide with each ballot

a separate sheet containing approximately 100 names with a brief

biography of each person, each of whom has taken part in various

activities during the six years of exile. They will be from every

side of the political fence.

If voters want to have soncone who is

not on this list, 1t 1s their privilege. This 10 & free and 1n-

dependent popular expression or election, if you want to call 1t

that. Perhaps in about a week or so we will buy a full-page in

La Opinion (Spanish-Language daily in Los Angeles] and explain

the viole procedure. Also, we're going to keep a barrage of radio

announcement gone explaining to the lie pee me apron

of the election, giving out the names, doing everything possible t

create enthusiasm for these elections.

32. Now, this is going to shock many people in New York and

Miant, but we want to shock them because they don't seem to be

doing anything at all. If, between now and the 25th of April,

they get their heads together and do sometbing similar, fine.

All we want to do is get the ball rolling. Hopefully, they will

do something similar.

33.

Incidentally, I should mention that we are going to try

in the next week, after we get everything straightened out, to

ontact someone in the larger US cities, Mexico City, Puerto Rico,

Caracas, Madrid and Santa Domingo, which are big centers of Cuban

exiles, and all the Central Anerican republics. We're going to try

to encourage elections simultaneously in each of these countries

and in every city of the US.

If we are capable in the next four

weeks to set the ball rolling in all these centers of Cubans, then

we will count the ballots that same day.

If we can only have our

own elections in the Western states on

the 25th of April, then we

will place the sealed ballot boxes in safe-keeping and wait until

the other cities have held their elections and then do the counting

the same day.

Otherwise, we might destroy the whole election if we

Indicated Cellioria's preferences.

34. Now, let's suppose that the elections have come off

beautifully throughout the whole

world, with expressions from

200 to 300 thousand Cubans.

What happens next? Well, those who

have been elected are going so have

to act because they have

received a mandate I am sure they will regard very carefully.

I can tell you now that the people elected who do not accept

this mandate had better forget ahout going back to Cuba.

so to a Central American country, perhape to Panana, who knows? But

the most important thing that I bant you to know is

so subalt to the government of exiles or in exile a master plan for the

liberation of Cuba.

• 35. This master plan i8 simple and ve belleve strongly in 1t.

rais government in exile or of exiles would have such tremendous

suthority with the backing of periaps 320 thousand Cubans that 1t

wuld be strong enough to overcone the fears of the State Department.

we believe that the Averican people vould endorse this exercise of

denocracy right in their own yard by people who want to liberate their

or country. I think that the people of the US, il properly informed,

would probably want their soverument to help. I don't think that the

people of the ls vould tolerate azy opposition from the State Depart

ment unless it could prove that this was bad for the US. Knowing the

influence of American public opinion, we feel that thie step will

actually change the thinking of te people in State who at this time

may be opposed to this idea.

36. Now, If we are able to aller the thinking of the State Depart-

went so that it will not oppose wistever latin American countries may

be disposed to help the exile moverent,

then we come to the final stage

of our thinking and our reason for creating this government of exiles

in exile. The floal stage 1s siaply this, The government of exiles or

in exile, or at least 1te President and its equivalent of Secretary of

State, perhaps,

should visit each of the heads of government of the

followiag republica: Guatemala, conduras, Nicaragus, El Salvador, Costa

Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, and the free

associated state of Puerto Rico.

The exile group should discuss with

the beads of these 10 Caribbean countries a plan for organizing in each

an arzy or a brigade which hoperully would be composed of three elements:

Cubars, local citlzenry and local cilitary men.

The cubans of military age would come from all over to get

military training at bases provided in one of these 10 countries.

We

thiak that the Cuban element would number approximately 50 thousand

Cubans of military age who would be distributed throughout these 10

countries. Then ve would lave the local citizenry, the youth of these

10 countries, who would like to participate in this Army of the Caribbean,

not to fight Castro for the sake oi the Cubans, out for their own safety

and for telt own countries. Castro has proven hinsell a menace to the

38. Now come the big questions - ho is going to pay for all

this?

Who is going to supply the amritiont

ware? Or the armada necessary for an israsion of Cuba by an aruy

that may have between 150 thousand asi äU thousand men. he believe

that the Cuban Government of extles o" in exile can make arrangemente

with each of these countries to provide tases, military facilitles,

training areas, military advisors, food, and bousing for that part

of the

liberation force In that counter. If one or another country

1s not financially able to do this I ar sure that once the army

begins to form, the bases working and he training started, there

would be a nove throughout all of Aserica, north, central and south,

to raise funds for Cuba's liberation. I'm sure that millions would

be available.

39.

The next question is military sardare. I'm afraid Uncle

Sam, directly or indirectly, is the bair source of supply that ve

can look to.

He would like to keep lacie San out of any inter

national Involvement and let this be essentially a movement by

latin Americans for latin American purposes.

Eowever,

there should

be nothing

to keep the US from supplying toese legitinate govern-

ments with

whatever arms they request.

ras later,

In turn, could

make these

aros available to the brigaies being trained in each

country.

I believe

the US Governuent 15 as artious to eradicate

Communism from America as it 1s from Sourceast Asis, and certainly,

it can find

& way to supply hardware to sese 10 inter-Anerican

armies within

corpletely normel inter-goreranent transactions.

There need be no direct contact between se IS Government and the

Cuban exiles.

40. Once this army 1s trained there"s always the possibility

Castro might be assassinated, or other Aberican plans wight be put

In tia: bagpy event, we will dis-

don't think they should be there any longer. Then we'll see

either Castro fly out of Cuba or have his bead blown off by bis

own men, most of whom would rather be heroes of the revolution

but if it doesn't, then the army of liberation will have to invade

Cuba and go all-out. This is the way I see it and this is about

I would like to emphasize that it is of the preatest
