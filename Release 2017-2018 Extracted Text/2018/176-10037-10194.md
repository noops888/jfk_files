Mrs. Kennedy had originally expected to put out nowe quietly

While still andous that thie be put on public record, she now

prefera that it be done from Moroceen end. So hope you can suggent

It come from Moroceans thomselves. It thia can't be arranged, we'd

appreciate it if you could background press in low key yoursell.

Mrs. Kennedy aska that we espress her apologies about putting you to

all this bother.

Theme of any release might be simply that Mre. Keanedy most

and raising her children in US will leave her all too little time make
