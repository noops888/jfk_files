REPS$

(a) HKi=w=1607, 30 karch 1956

(b) HKhi-n-1505, 28 December 1955

DATE 27 April 1256

Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed prosotion

of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires

also at this tine to bring to the attention

of Headquarters the merits

of granting Vaivaja staff status either

concurrently with the promotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasible.

The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status,

for a number of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Vaivada has not been

entitled

to the standard step increases that accrue to regular iS enployees •

Koreover he has not had the benefii of recent legislative increases in basic

salary rates,

such thai his salary, originally set l6 August 1954 at the then

GS-9 levels

is still $5050.00 per animo

Perhaps of more importance than

the foregoing consideracions is the fact that this agent has been and is

losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and other nore long

term advantages availacle to staff personnel. The agent has several tines

expressed to the case officer his concern, as a fanily nan,

over the fact that

he is not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. Vaivadals.

expressed career interests lie in contired employment by KU BARK, nore

especially in the area of

Jassignments in the field, and in

view of nis qualities of character and high level of performance for ki BARK

the Station has no hesitation in recommending to Headcuarters that he be

marded the desired change in status.

In view of the agent's present salary level it is recommended that the

pronotion iron his present graie be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per

anun salary-of-05,915.00. If Headquarters concurs-in-the-recommendation-

that the agent be granted staff officer statis, the agent would move up to

tbe GS-ll Erade at that time.

the monthly pay scale for

his signature on the travel roucher prevously submitted covering his travel

to washington, D. C.

BIRADIAL indicated that the combination of his schooling

in the nornings and his covert training in the afternoons which

also keeps him busy during the weekend, is keeping him fully occupied.

Though he did not press the issue. he wordered wether it would be necessary

to continue his schooling

both decided however that,

should continue iis schooling

irezarcless of the dordship placed on him, he

since any inquiries

could then be properly and legitinately backstopped®

One of the difficulties

involved is the anount of daily travel between the University and his

residences

Inasmuch as the distance involved plus the high rental cost factor

(175.00 per month) present a few difficulties.

This plus the fact that the

plausibility

of a student paying sucn rent is soremat questionable, BiRDlaI

indicated he might nove to a more suitable location.®

On 23 October 1953 he inforned he was movingl
