FROM & Chief Mi Station, Habana
: GENRAL « Operational - W125
part) SUBPST | coscinc = Arthur O. Vaivada

REFS: (a) HK#sW-1607, 30 Harch 1956
(b) HKH-W-1505, 28 December 1955

1. Regarding reference (2) the Station concurs fully with the proposed promotion
of Artiur G. Vaivada and desires also at this time to bring to the atvention
of Headquarters the merits of granting Yaivada stelf status either
concurrently with the cromotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasibles

eee The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such siztus,
| for a mmber of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Veivada has not been
entitled to the standard step increases that accrue to regular GS enployees «
H Koreover he has not iad the benefiv of recent legislative increases in basic
: salary rates, such taai his salary, originally set 16 August 195i et the then
é GS-9 level, is still $5060.CO per enmum. Perhaps of more importance than
i * the foregoing considerations is the fact thet this egent.has been andis  ‘
losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and other nore long-
term advantages availstle to steff personnel. The agent has several tines
‘expressed to the case officer his concern, as a family mén, over the fact that™
_... he ds not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. -Vaivada's
expressed career interests lie in coutimed employment by KUBARK, nore
especially in the area of Jessignments in the field, and in
view of nis qualities of character and high level of performance for KUBARK
the Station has no hesitetion in recommending to Headcuarters that he be
awarded the desired chenge in status.

Be In view of the agent's present salary level it is reconmended’that the
promotion from his present grade be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per
_____anmmm_salary_of_§5,915. If_Headearters_concurs_in_the_recomnendation_
that the agent be gran 2°! iS, the agent would move up to
the-GS-1- grade ‘at-thet-time. -——. --- eee ee

It should be noted, thet Agent over a period of seversl contacts appeared
to be very cooperative end his attitude ws cosendable. nen he first
learned that he had been denied entry ne was saxevhat
chagrined since he appeared to be sct Gi an attempt 0 co a good job in
a "tight" area. He had not given up hope to obtain proper authorization
and was willing to pursue the matter further since he felt over a period
of time he would be ellowed proper entry authority. He suggested several
possibilities. ~

Agent, also expressed a desire to go to Cuba or anywhere else the Agency
felt he could be of bast service to the Agency régerdless of the difficulties
within reason, which pay have been imposed on him and his fa ily.

In view of Agent's pest successful record with tis kgency, in view of his
attitude, his future Dosasbanstses and his comparatively limited saléy

it wes suggested to jthat he might consider a raise in Agent's
salary.
