Subject

Classification of EX 3600

¿Re your request for "a couple sentences. of factual

data asto why this

is documenteds classified here they ares

1. -Exipost facto, since I was not associated

with Operation MHCHAOS during its existence,

I can only

offersthe following reasonable Surmise. As we now know,

tenure MiCHAOs was one of the most

sensitive

operations

conducted under

Dip aegis, repeatedly sanctioned

(in

writing) by the DCI.

The activity was deemed so sensi-

tive:

that it was controlled by/through extremely restricted

handling&

Channels

think it follows logically, at least

in my a

wich, that any

¿document

produced by MAchaos, whether

a formal or informal one, would have been Classified at

least SECRET ®

2. Does the information in this document warrant

classification today®

PAT thinkit does, and I believe the a

current classification of CONFIDENTIAL is proper. Reading
