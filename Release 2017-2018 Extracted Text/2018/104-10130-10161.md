1. on 13 April 1960, I discussed this case with Mr. McCarthy
â€˜of I&NS, who stated that he saw no objection under their present
policy to havingthe subject apply for e visitor's visa at Caracas,
Venezuela to come to the United States. Mr. McCarthy stated,
however, that the subject would not be admitted as a visitor on
the basis of his visa, but he would be paroled into the United
States under the Special Agreement between the Attorney General
and the DCI.

\p-vT 2. Martha Tharp, WH Division, was advised to instruct the
[Station at Caracas] to have the subject obtain a visa if he does
t have one and advise this Office of his ETA in advance.
