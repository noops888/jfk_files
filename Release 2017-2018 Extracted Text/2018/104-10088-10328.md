October 1961, HMMA- 14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18
November 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this ob-
jective. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex-
tensively co follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex-
cellent exampie of this blending of various Station support assets was the
investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both

Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in
this manaer has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related
Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive intelligence
nor has ir been intended that it should do so. The project's sole purpose
d is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information
° in support of cther Station operations.

1968 (through 30 September 1962) expended about $7,000.00, It is
anticipated that about $8, 000, 00 will be expended during the last two

make a ‘otal expenditure during the project year of about $43, 250, or
$5, 250.00 under the budget estimate of $49,500.00.

other Station activities in géneYal. SCANTLING's production, measured

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.,
rent hotei rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances,”
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extreme luable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.

4, he quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile, Pye@tation concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should\be continued.

C. Targets of Opportunity. = The\haNediate availability of independent
assets to perform inveskigagions: photographic assignmenis and other
essential types of support\stivices in connéction with Station targets of
opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers
highly significant, It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be
sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can
be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and activit

5 hough the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year,

PROBLEMS

A, Security - The activities of the I Hp base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result of thempest of three KURIOT
technicians by the CybatGovernment, ‘! One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge ofvthe ‘four LIMUST units (LICALLA. is located in.one
of these units) and the Station consideredsit appropriate to suspend photo-
graphic op. ns pending xesolytion of'the situation, At this time,
there is no indication whén\LICALLA operations will be resumed, The
LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual

inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA

has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a

possibi
other s:

ity will exist until the release of the three technicians, No
urity problems have occurred during he past year,

of these experiments, nigyt\phetography has not yet been attempted,

It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which
all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously
used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all
base phorographs have been increased considerably as a direct result
of this new film,

C, General Comments ~ The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion conternplated at this time, It is

t SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim

for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
