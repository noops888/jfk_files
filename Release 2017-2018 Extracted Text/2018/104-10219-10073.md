Dr. Roscoa Beryl WHITE
Interview 25 Octobar 1965

1. Subject arrived in Moscow during the early part
of November 1963 on a ten month exchange fellowship
arranged between the National Academy of Sclences and
the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Subject was assignod to
the Lebodev Pnysics Institute in Moscow and the aajor
portion of his life while in Moscow revolved around his
work at the Institute or various individuala met through
the Institute, Subject ate lunch in the Institute lunch
room or cafeteria and usually at about the same time each
day, sonetine between 1:00 and 1:30. Approximately two
weeks after he had arrived at the Institute, Supject and
his colleague, Dr. George RENNINGER, who was at the
Institute on a similar ten month exchange fallowship,
ware approached by Vlajimir Anatolovich SOKOLOVUKIY
while waiting in the cafeteria line. SOKOLOVSKIX, who
identified himself as an American, said that he nad heard
that they were in the Institute and wanted to meet them,
During tiis first ccaversation Subject claims that
SOKOLOVSKIY told thea that he was in fact William daailton
MARTIN and went on to axplain soza of the superficial de-
tails surrounding his dafection to the Sovict Union in
1960, MARTIN told them that if they did not consider him
too tainted ha would welcome the opportunity of talking
to some Americans. jc felt that there were many facets
of his experiences-while in the Soviet Union which he would
like to talk about but which he could not discuss with nis
Soviet friends. Zither on this occasion or later, MARTIN
mentioned that Bernon KITCHELL, who had defected with MARTIN,
was living in Leningrad.

2. Approximately a week later, Subject met MARTIN again

in the lunch room, MARTIN reported that following his first

encounter with Subject and Renninger he had been called into
the Party office at the Institute, They apologized to hin
for not having warned him in advance that Subject and
Renninger ware being assigned to the Institute, since they
were certain that Subject would. rave wanted to avoid then.
They told MARTIN that it was perfectly permissible for hin

to talk to them, but that he should definitely not reveal his

true identity to than nor should ne qive then his address in
Moscow since there was the possibility that taey nad Losn
gent to the Soviet Union to assassinate hin. Quite natural-
ly they also wanted to know what Martin had discussed with
Bubject and Renainger. As a gonoral rule, Suvjact sae
MARTIN in the lunch room every week or t#o for the entire
period that be was in Aoscow, On cercain occasions it
appeared that MARTIN would avoid talking to Susject. Sased
on MARTIN's actions, Surject asewsed tais usually depended
on wao was present in the lunch roma, Subjece adied at tnis
podnt that their discussions with MARTIN were always ia
English.

3. ARTIS made it cofinitely clear to Sudject tnat
he was interested in gutting out of the Soviet Unlon, Le
described lifa in the USSA ag a constant gana with the
Soviet officials, HARTIU felt that he had only been able
to keap nis head above water while thare becausa of nis,
knowledge of Soviet lav. ie axplained to Suvject that ne
haé dovoted a great dual of tine atucyin. Soviet law and
nad used his knowledga to protect hlaself. Zac Soviets
were frequently at a loss when confronted with quotations
from tasir own laws in total conflict with actions which
they wero trying to idnposa on MARTIN. Subject was onca
asked to write a latter to NARTIN's parents asking thea to
put prassure oa the Soviets and the Press to help in ob~
taining nis release.

6. MARTIN also described in great dota{l to Subject
life is general within the Soviet Union and what the aver=
aje Soviet citizen must face every day. It vas sbylous to
Subject that MARTIN bad been greatly disillusioned follow
dng ais arrival in tho USS when ne found a society totally
aifferent from what ha had anticipated prior to his departure
frog the United Staten. The Soviets had exerted consider-
able pressura on Subject to participate in various anti-uU.3.
radio programs or to write anti-U.5. articles. After auca
Giscussion back and forth, MARTIN agread to write something
4£ they would promise to publish it without editing. de
wrote what hea considerad a very o2jective comparison of life



Sena

in the USSR and that in the U.S. After having submitted
‘this article he was never approached again on this topic.

5. Regular contacts between Sudject; RZNNINGER and
MARTIN continued in the luncn room with general conversations
Buch as tnos@ noted above until December or early January
1964, At this point, MARTIN asked Subject if ne or RENNINGER
would go to the U.S, 2mbassy to ask them if there were any
wey in wnich they could assist him in leaving the Soviet aie]
Union legally or otnerwisa, Subject noted that RENNINGER 1
had already contacted the U.S. Embassy following the first
meeting with MARTIN to report on their conversations with i
him and the fact that he was in Moscow.

6. Also at about tho same time, probably early January,
Subject was standing in the lunch room lino (Subject always !
referred to it as the lunch room rathez than a cafeteria) i
when he saw MARTIN togother with an attractive young girl
about 20 or 21 years of age. Thoy stopped .to chat for a
moment and MARTIN introduced Alla Aleksandrovna KOZLOVA.
Subject emphasized that this was ontirely casual and that
thoir conversation at this meeting lasted for only a faw
minutes. A few days or possibly a week lator, MARTIN saw
Subject in the lunch room and mentioned that "Alla‘ had
found him quite a handsome individual. ‘MARTIN ientioned
this only in passing and in no way, as far as Subject was
concerned, attempted to force “Alla“ on Subject. Subject
was equally impressed with "Alla" and during the following
few days made several inquiries anong his Sovict colleagues
in the Institute. No ona had. anything particular to say
about her other than that she was rather active socially and
had many frienda in the Institute. At this point.Subject
dié not know where she worked at tha Institute.

7. Sometime during the latter part of January 1964 :
Subject had his first date with "Alla.* Subject could not
recall exactly how this was arranged, but he believes that
. ° he met her in the lunch room and asked her.to go on a troika
i ride with him. This was followed by five or six other dates
with her over the next seven or eight weeks. They went to a
film once, the Bolshoi once, the opera once, and restaurants
on two or three occasions.

After a while Subject noticed that she was particularly
interested in his Soviet friends and other contacts in the

i ngeegeie'se a


s

Soviet Union. For example, on the evening tuey attended
the Bolshoi, Subject noticed his friond William (3111)
PARRIS, an American oxchange student at the Moscow State
University. Subject had known hia at Priacaton University.
Subject said, "On, there i3 bill.“ Sho inrediately said,
*What did you.sa; In otner words, she
know perfectly wall that SOXOLOVSKIY and dilliam MARTIY
wers one and the sauce. She was ooviously eaoarrassed and
tried without success to cover up her blunder. MARTIN
later told Subject that “Alla® had called Aim that evening
to tell him of ner blunder, $ha also once asked Subject
if he were really going to return to the United States.
This could, of course, be interpreted as a defaction pitcn.
Subject feels that it was more of a casual personal remark.

9. According to Subject, “Alla* seemad to him to ba
much too friendly, wnile at the sane tima not sincerely
friendly. In Pepruary, Subject's suspicions had wounted
to a point where he dacided to ask nis Soviet colleague in
the Institute, Ilya ROYZIN (phonatic), Lf he could check
with some of his contacts to determine if "Alla" was in
fact being used against him for sone purpose. Subject
claimed that he already know at this point through conversa-
tions with nie Soviet colleagues that ROYZIN could check
without bringing it to anyone's attention. Shortly after-
wards, ROYZIN returned to Subject with the advice to stop
seeing bor. He cautioned Subject that he should not mention
to anyone that he nad talked to him and certainly not to say
anything. Subject clains that he stopped dating her after
this point, but did occasionally seo her in the luach rooa.
After Subject stopped seeing hor she called h at ais
hotel every two or three days.. At no point ‘did MARTIN
really push Subject on continuing the relationship.

10. Subjoct described their relationship as perfectly
natural for two young people interested in aach other.
They seldoa discussed anything of importance and never
discussed his work at the Institute. Subject vent heme

‘with her to her apartment on two scparate occasions. Once

she asked him to spend the night with her, but he indicated
that he should get back to his notel. Subjact described her
as possibly a bit more forward sexually than otners tnat he
had met, but that their relationship was perfectly normal
and certainly nothing that could be used against him since



hea was a single man. The apartsent was actually her mother's,
a one room apartment with an alcove for the bed and a small
kitchen. Subject never met hor motner and is not sure if

hor father lived {n the apartaent with the mother, Subject
does recall that her sothar had had two husbands although as
did not know if the first one nad uled or if they nad been
eivoread. Subject heard from someone that her father worked
for the KGB, Subject could provide absolutely no further
{nformation on this point. °Alla" never seenod to be push-
ing tne relationship even though she did seem curious about
soze of Eurvject's friends, Once she nentioned to Subject
that they should not be sean together in the lunch room since
this might be a risk for her.

ll, Subject last saw “Alla* alone just before ha left
the Soviet Union, He was downtown one day and met her by
chance. They. stopped. for coffea and chatted a while. The
only thing of any significance noted was that sho had been
dismissed trom the Lebecev Institute and was then working
for the Ministry of Poreign Affairs. During the swumer,
Subject and PANNINGER again visited Moscow tor a woek (15 -
20 July 1965). Thay drove from Trieste to Prague and then
on into Moscow via trala. Arrangemsnts were made through
Inturist. They visited the Lebedev Institute for a day,
as well aa friends. in Moscow, Nothing occurred on this visit.
of any particular note. Since his raturn, Subject has
received a brief letter from “Alla” in elementary German,
