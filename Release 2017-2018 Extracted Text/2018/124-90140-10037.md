By letter dated June 29, 1961, CIA advised Tt had
received information from that the(S)
subject was supplying "Prdgon,* an Argentine newspaper“ with
material for publication. The newspaper was described as being
anticommunist. CIA possessed no additional information on subject

or "Pregon” and requested data regarding subject possessed by this ,
Bureau for passage to SY oS

We had no information to furnish CIA upon receipt of
their request and initiatéd inquiry to identify subject. Inasmuch
as we have now developed background data concerning him we are
furnishing same to CIA for passage to their sources. Also since
we are requesting them to furnish us with any additional data they /
develop it is considered desirable to allow CIA to furnish this i
material to their sources rather than Legat. In this manner
we will be assured that the source who is apparently in a position
to Imow of subject’s association with “Pregon" will have the results
of our inquiry. Legat, however, should and is being alerted to in-
stant matter. Evaluation memorandum is not being disseminated with
report to CIA as CIA is the other Government agency mentioned
