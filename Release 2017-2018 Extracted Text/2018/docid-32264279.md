Dear Mr. Smith

I would like to apologize for the delay in answering your letter of 20:

January 1978.

I have been on travel and have been extremely busy with

congressional hearings.

Unfortunately there is little help I can offer you. Scientificly there is

no evidence that electromagnetic radiation can result in the symptoms you

describe.

As you may know, today there is a great deal of controversy

concerning the biological effects of non-ionizing radiation within the

scientific community. We do know that high levels can cause heating, for

example the use of microwave ovens for cooking.

Any other effects are presently highly controversial. Many effects have

been observed in animal models exposed-under laboratory conditions. In

studtes observing personnel, no physiological changes have been detected

to date. The Follow-Up Agency of the National Academy of Sciences: has

recently been studying the effects of Navy personnel who work in areas

where exposure to non-ionizing radiation was likely. The research has not

yet been published but the study results were reported last year at.

meeting sponsored by the Bureau of Radiological Health. The study found no

significant difference between men exposed and those not exposed except in

one area. The study found that those exposed had less heart disease than

did the non-exposed group. But whether this is really true or not remains:

open to further study

Even in the laboratory studies,

there is no evidence that any symptoms

described

in your letter have

been reproduced in animals undergoing

extensive irradiation.

While there are many questions still to be answered, I do not believe that

your symptoms are the result of non-ionizing, radiation exposure.

I wish that I could be of more assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,

Pan STylis

PAUL E. TYLER, M.D.

Dear Mr. Smith:

I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letters

dated June 29, 1978 and July 23, 1978.

A review of this correspondence fails to reflect

a violation within the investigative jurisdiction of the

FBI; consequently, I cannot be of assistance.

Should you fear for your personal safety, I

suggest you contact the New York CIty Police Department

for whatever assistance they may be able to render you

in this regard.

Very truly yours,
