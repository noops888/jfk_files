Coordinators of the event said they hope forti

naticnal female march on the Capitol since women won the

right to vote in 1920.

"D=: Barbara Roberts, national project director

of the coalitions, said the march, scheduled to go past

the White House and down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol,

would attack "abortion laws: which degrade, mutilate and

murder women."

"The coalition, which comprises about 30 women's

groups, will also demonstrate against forced sterilization

and restrictive contraception laws and plans to hold

national abortion hearings in Washington before the march."

First source advised on October 15, 1971, that the

November 20, 1971, rally has received mixed support. from

various Washington, D. C., women:'s liberation groups.

Several radical women's groups refused to endorse the November

20, 1971, action because they view it as a Young Socialist

Alliance (7SA)/Socialist Workers Party (SW) Front which will

use these rallies

to further 1ts own recruitment drive.

Furthermore, they considered YSA/SWP to be "non-feminist"'.

• Main support for the November 20, 1971, demonstration will come

from the WSA Women's Fraction Group.

• SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS, WASHINGTON, D. Co, AND

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, NOVEMBER 20, 1971,

SPONSORED BY THE-WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION

ACTION COALITION

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in

Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build

public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a

conference held at Columbia, University, New York City, in July, 1971, which

was attended by approximately 1, 000 women from 29 states. The conference

voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.

Subsequent to its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in

San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the

repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, and to call

for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington

Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the

Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party

(SWP). Carol Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director

of the Washington march.

Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have

lestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between

/10, 000 and 20, 000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed

information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the

demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan

Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5,000 persons

BIRT

REC-23.

Demonstrators are scheduled to assemble at the Ellipse between

10 a.m. and 12 noon and will march via 17th Street to H Street, down H Street

to 15th Street, down 15th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, and then easton

¡ Pennsylvania Avenue to the west steps of the Capitol. A rally will be held

at the latter site between 2 and 6 p.m.

ACTION COALITION (NONRAC

SPONSORED DEMONSTRATION

lovenber 20, 1971

Washington, D. C

The WONAAC is self-described in its literature

as being formed by the national conference of

more than 1,000 women held in New York City,

New York, in July 1971.

At that conference,

women from 29 states and 253 organizations came

together to unite their efforts in the national

fight for the repeal of all abortion laws and

for the corollary demands of no forced sterilization

and repeal of contraception laws.

The conference

called for a massive show of force for these goais

in a march on washington, D.C., and San Francisco,

California, November 20, 1971.

WONAAC is based

on a program of legislative, judicial, and

mass demonstration activities on a local and

national level, and seeks to unite all women ir

the fight for the right of abortion.

The September 22, 1971, issue ce the "Los Angeles Times";

a newspaper of general circulation published saily in Los Angeles,

California, contains

an article on page o, part tv, datelined

washingion,

D. C., entitled "Abortion larch Mobilizing"

", which

article states in

part as follows:

"Women from 253 organizations across the country

are mobilizing for

mass demonstrations here

(Washington, E. C.) and

in San Francisco in

November to support the complete repeal of all

abortion laws.

FEDERAL BUREAL OF IJYESTICATIOS

BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

FEBRUARY 8, 1972

RE: WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE OF MARYLAND

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

(TROTSKYIST)

On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to

hold demonstrations at Washingtön, D. C. and San Francisco,

CarIornia on November 20, 4J(L.

The purpose of the

demonstrations were to call for

the repeal of all abortion,

contraception and forced sterilization laws. The Women's.

Right to Choose of Marylana, the Baltimore, Marylana

affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing

arrangements for out-of-state women.

On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028

Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful

in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration

among Baltimore area women.

Therefore, the plan to charter

a bus for the purpose of transporting

, demonstrators to the

Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.

On November 30, 1971, a second source advised

that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been

formed as an "ad hoc"

group for the specific purpose of

supporting the November 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-

tion. The source further stated that the Women's

Right

to Choose of harylana ceased to exist, following this

demonstration, and is now defunct.

Re :

Women's National Abortion Action

Coalition (WONAAC) Convention,

February 11 - 13,

1972

Boston,

Massachusetts

on February 18, 1972, source, who has turnished

reliable information in the past, furnished the following

information:

A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition

(WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,

Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of february 11

13, 1972.

Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance

at this convention which was held to determine future action

Of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's

Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.

Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) from all over the county

were requested by the

national office of the SWP and YSA

to attend this convention in order to insure the effective

control of the convention by the SWP.

:

As the youth organization of the socialist

workers Farty (SHP), the Young

socinlist Alliance"

(TSA) serves as

the

main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of its official publication,

"The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A multi-

national

revolutionary socialist youth organi-

zation. "

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Re: WONAAC

The SIP specifically wished the convention to

adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete

control of the fenale body

by the individual female.

This specific issue,

"women control their bodies" was

adopted by the women's organization and all other propo-

sals were rejected.

Workshops were organized for each of the many

separate racial and ethnis groups represented at the

conference.

Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-

fic group

intended and all were supposedly controlled by

the

SVP.

A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop

was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.

Among the issues discussed at

the workshop were the

attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-

dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard

to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups

all to often find themselves without a voice when real

issues are involved.

Of particular importance to the group was the

La Raza Unida Party, &

legitirate political

party in Texas

which serves to unita Mexican Anaricans. Of equal impor

tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, Which the group

felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want

children and are forced to live with men because of the

mores of American society.

Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion

law repeal will serve

to unite women under one banner and

more

effectively serve the

Women's Movement.

The convention adjourned after an agreement that

an "Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972.

This action vould serve to keep public attention focused

on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective

support from

the many thousands of women who want to right

to choose.

a.

On November 20, 1971, apDroximately 1,500 women,

representing womens liberation groups from the East Coast and

Mid-West, gathered on the Flliose in WDC, in response to the

call by WONAAC to march on the United States Capitol to demand

and the demonstration ended without incident.

(Physical observation, Special

Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,

• Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300

women attended the conference, which once agair, re-established

and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand.

It was

noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to

create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings

across the country had been disappointingly small. It was

pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers

of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the

abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists

and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement

could not succeed without the support of the working women.

At the close of the conference, WONAAC strongly endorsed

the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," which is to be introduced in

the U. S. Congress by Congressronon BELLA KBZUG from New York.

This bill would override all

laws which impose sanctions upon

those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

a. Proposed Actions

...•

...

It was moved and adopted during the above conference.

that WONAAC sponsor a week of local abortion activities, May 1-6,

1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative sunport,

judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-

tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for redeal of all anti-

abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to

forced sterilization.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary pronosals were

adopted during the conference:

individuals associated with this Women's Lib group are

connected with any subversive organizations such as

They are merely women's Liberationists, who support

the repeal of all abortion laws.

In view of the above, no active investigation

is being conducted by the Jacksonville Division of the

Re report of ARLAND A. MOSEL dated 3/21/72 at

Washington Field.

!

The State University of New York at Binghamton

is part of the University system of the State of New York, "

and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of

approximately 7,500

students.

The student newspaper

published at the University twice weekly during the school

year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the

classified section as follows:.

"Women who have had abortions needed to relate

their experiences to other women, educate all women

about abortion at abortion

speak out October 21. Contact

Linda L., extention 4130."

The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream"

newspaper published at the State University of New York

at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton

Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets for the

Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,

repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization

for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and

tickets were on sale at the student center.

Cars and

volunteers were needed and they were to contact LINDA LOEW

at extention 4129.

INFORMANT

who is familiar with New

Left activities on the campus of the State University

New York at Binghamton was

contacted regularly during

of

the

school year of 1971-72 and he stated that he did see

some signs on bulletin boards in the Fall.of 1971 about

abortion organizations, but never knew them to be of much

success on campus:

activity or signs on any bulletin boards from the period

May, 1972.

This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated

also at that time, that LINDA LOEW has been a close

associate of BETTY, SACHS who is the leader of the Young

Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.

Informant stated that there was no organization formed

his knowledge of a Womens

Abortion Action Coalition in

the Binghamton area.

Other sources familiar with New Left activities

on the campus of the State University of New York at

Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two

sources advised that they knew of no organization of

Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the

Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending

on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate

recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.

In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition

organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation

is being conducted by Albany.

I. ORGANIZATION

A, Origin and Objectives

The Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition

(BOWLAC), the local affiliate of the Women's National

Abortion

Action Coalition (WONSAC), was formed during

late sumner, 1971, out of the local Female Liberation

(FL) gIoup..

BS Tol

November 17, 1971

BOWMAC was originally a subcomittee of FL

in the Greater Boston Area but as of Jenuary, 1972, had

grown into a separate group whose specific interest was

in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are

also active in other FL work; however, all individuals

active in FI work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC

being the smaller of the two groups.

January 12, 1972

WONSAC has been publicly deccribed

as an organization of groups whose ain

is to effect the overthrow of existing

abortion laws and to establish free

abortion on demand.

During early March, 1972, TOBA SINGER roported

that at an increasing rate abortion ork was becoming a

more important area of work than Fu and that a

number of SWP and YSA female members were being trans

ferred into the abortion work.

BS I-1

Narch 26, 1972

The stress of the SiP/YSA fomalo members in the

general Boston area who are active in female matters con-

tinues to be away from FL and into BOWAAC with only two

of three remaining on the fringes to follow FL activities.

BS T*1

May 10, 1972

Recent reports concerning SWP/YSA faction work

within BOWAAC disclose that, as previously occured with

the Party's work within Fl.,

those in the Pasty faction

have apparently alicnated themselves fron the other

females active in BOMiC and for the most part love lost

any support from others not in the Party fection.

Aay

suggestions now offered by those of the Party faction in.:

BOWWAC, which comprises approximately half of the activists

in the

group, are no longer accepted, cense considerable

argument and there is evidence of "red baiting"

• As a

result, the Party faction does not now believe that they

can -build. BOWAC into any successful supporter type

organization as had resulted through Party work in the

Student Mobilization Cormittee (SMC)•

The "Boston Globe"

, a daily newspaper published

in Boston, in its February 13, 1972 edition, carried an

article entitled "Abortion Strategy Discussed" which in

part reported that more than 800 women fxon across the

country had gathered for a conference at Boston University

the weekend of February 11-13, 1972 to plan a strategy

to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion. Accord-.

ing to the article, it was expected thut the conference

would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all

endo settle, it ste

state laws restricting abortion• "The Abortion Rights

Act of 1972"

, to be introduced by United States Congress

Woman BELLA ABZUG from New York. The article reported

that discussion at the conference had centered around

whether or not to adopt the slogan "Free Abortion on

Deniana; No Forced Sterilization" os to focus on a

single issue - repeal of the abortion laws. It further

reported that & proposal was presented for an Abortion

Action Week, May 1 to 6, 1972, to incluce educational prom

grams, legislative support, judicial action and local or

regional denonstrations centering around the demand for

repeal

ot all anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws

and an end to forced sterilization.

JANE ROLAND, identified in the article as

coordinator of BORAAC,

nas reported to have stated that

whatever the conference does notionally her organization

would be acting at the local level.

The Febiary 13, 1972, session of the WONSAC

Conference at Boston University was in the form of

workchops held in approximately eight classicons with

about 50 females in attendance at each workshop The

maximum number of persons prescat at any one time dur--

The workshops primarily related to the building of MONAAC

throughout the United States, fund raising and regional

work, with ldeas being exchangca between indiviauals

attending from various areas of the country, including

Boston.

The major theme appeared to be how

to strengthen

awareness of WONAAC, which was reportedly in need of

financial support.

Literature tables were set up on the

periphery of the workshops and among organizetions iden

tified with the tables was the YSA..

Re :

National Women's Political Caucus (NNPC)

Policy Council

Meeting

Source, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972:

A Policy Council Meeting of the National Women's

Political Caucus (NVPC) was held in Washinaton, D.C. during

the period June 21, 1972 - June 25, 1972.

The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open

organization of politically motivated women

seeking equal recognition

in the American

community.

During the Policy Council Meeting there were no

overt attempts by any organized group to influence the policy

meeting and there were no individuals present who identified

themselves

as members of any organization which might be construed

as subversive and/o supporting any cause except legitimate

change.

significance, however, was the fact that literature

of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (NONAAC) was

present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting

All of the MONAAC material was geared to the abortion

movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for

Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972..

WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of

forming a national movement of groups scattered

throughout the United States who favor and

now work to legalize abortion.

The Young Socialist

Alliance

(YSA) and Socialist Forkers Party (SP)

are playing a major role in moNAAC.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

ENCLOSURE

NW 55090 DocId: 32989546 Page 241

## Page 242

Re:

NWPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves as the main source of recruitment into

that organization.

The YSA is described in the

masthead of its official

publication, "The Young

Socialist Organizer," as

"a multinatinnal

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary

Clarke,

who is associated with the Southern California IPC,

an affiliate of the NWPC, advised a group of policy council

members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California WPC

name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that MONAAC

had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and

vere very effective at taking control of small gatherings:

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose

name was not

recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were

a good group".

This woman's position was not supported and,

in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted bu those persons

present.

Jill Ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,

is reportedly concerned about the SWP's

attempts

to align

itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly

gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local

WPC grOUDS.

The NWPC organizing brochure suhlished by the NiPC

has been written to assist individual uPC groups in organizing.

The brochure lists political parties and para-political

organizations to be contacted bu caucus organizers when

forming

the nucleus of a WPC. Among those listed was the SiP. After

discussions at the caucus it was determined that the SWP should

se removea irom the list.

The new edition of the PC organizing

brochure will not lisi the SWP; it has been replaced br National

Peace Action Coalition (NPAC) •

The NPAC was founded

in 1970 by members of the SUP.

Its basic objective is to unite masses of people

including labor unions, GIs, and the black

community

in the struggle to end United States

intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and

peaceful tactics.

WaS SAMARA JAROSH.

PH, I-3 advised on January 14, 1972 that a that

time SAMARA-JAROSH was a member of the

SWP .

PH T-I advised on May 25, 1972 that it 1s difficult

to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs

Of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and

that he was not aware of

any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was

substantially controlled by the SWP.

Source explained that the

abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the

recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia

SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert

Street in Philadelphia.

The discussions held on the abortion

rights issue indicated

that the swP felt that the capitalistic

system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation

to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic

system being promoted by the swP would be in favor of abortion and

women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract

members of the SWP

She stated that she detested the intervention of the YSA-SiP

in this conference;

that the SHiP-YSA has caused conflict among

She also suggested that the

Confidential source number two related that the

evening plenary session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,

and it was immediately apparent that the socialist

Workers Party - Young Soalalist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group

dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make

statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor

leaders and these same persons continued to vote as a bloc

on all issues.

The group of independent women fron various geogra

phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the

SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was

adjourned

and considered the problem of how to handle the swp leaders.

While these women were not political realists in their goals,

they did believe in working throughout the existing system

rather than functioning with the SWP In their eventual goal

of revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists would

no longer continue hassling within WONAAC.

They did not want

to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominates

group.

They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC

in the name of abortion law change was not being used for that

purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles.

About 35

independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and

sympathizers were present.

Independents there were from New

Haven, Boston,.

Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and

San Francisco.

Most of the problems and differences between the

Independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion

law reform.

The swp was charged with always having demonstra-

tions and

sallies and

never doing any work through the legis

lative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of this

hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways

to change abortion laws

than carrying placards in the streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in

inont of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced

they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's

name is unknown.

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent

women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC

has debilitated the organization and most independent representa-

tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion

law change in organizations wich have no connection with the

SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC Will

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

there is also the concern that women new to the movement will

join in a mistaken notion that they will be furthering

abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving

New York that

they would try to publicize activities from the SuP in an

effort to prevent this.

As the youth organization of the socialist

Workers Party (SVP);

the ISA serves as the

main source oi recruitment into that organ

as information has been provided that WONAAC is, for the

most part, totally controlled by socialist Workers Party/

the activities of this aganization

the purpose of determining the

members of Socialist Workers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance,

and who are acting on behalf of these organizations.

Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of

information set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning

DIANE/PARRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the

Utica, New Tock area, and her reported communication with

national headquarters of WONAAC in New York City.

It would

appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such

in its division in connection with WONAAC.

Branch-socialist Workers Party (TCB-sWe), an

atIlllate of the socialist workers Party (SIP).

As the youth organization of the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance

(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described in

the masthead of its official publication, "The

Young Socialist Organizer, " as "A multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The MWAAC rally held May 6, 1972, began at the

residence of the governor of the State of Minnesota, 1006

Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, at approximately 3:30P.M.

and proceeded

to the State Capitol

Building where the rally

calling for the repeal of all abortion laws and emphasizing

the demand for the right to legal abortions was held.

The

rally was held without incident and speakers identified

included representatives trom

the YSA-TCG and the TCB-SWP.

Jane Van Deusen was the principle speaker for the MWAAC

at this rally which ended at approximately 5:30 P.M.

decided that an International Tribunal was planned for

October 21, 1972.

The International Tribunal would be

held in New York City, New York, and it was hoped that

plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be

held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after

which individuals would be designated to attend the inter-

national meeting scheduled for New York City. This July,

1972; meeting was the first activity on the part of the

MWAAC as a ner-organized effort following the May 6, 1972,

rally.

Individuals known to be involved in the women's

liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis

and

MWAAC. Former leaders in the women's liberation movement

the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active

participation in the affairs of this group. While the

May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota,

was attended by

some

due

200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be

to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on

SWP INFLUENCE

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SIP, nor

is it a part of the YSA-TCG.

Women's liberation is a topic

general interest and concern to the membership of the

TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MVAAC is

one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued

interest.

CONFIDENTTAL

Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, expressed

interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of

policy.

The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion

movement, is one aspect of this women's liberatión movement

which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,

both male and female. While the vast majority of women in

the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes

in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal

or change also include professional women, medical doctors,

lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all

walks of life:

## Page 293

NY 100-174481

F. Membership and Finances

According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a

formal membership, as such,

and financially exists only

through voluntary contributions.

allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement

with their own personal funds in order to get by.

G. WONAAC Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC

affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the US, and

that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate

or coalition.

11.

YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL

OVER WONAAC

NY T-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,

that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was

held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971,

to July 18, 1971, which resulted

in the founding of WONAAC.

NY T-l stated that it was immediately apparent that this

conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members

who infiltrated the various conference committees and

no infiltrated

workshops which were established to help formulate the

main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.

NY I-l stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,

in the future, dictate policy for this organization and

would be able to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY T-4 provided a leaflet

captioned, "What Every Woman Should Know"

This leaflet,

which was

published by Feminist Organization for Communi-

cation:; Action and Service (F.O.C.A.S.), related the following:

"The Womens

National Abortion Coalition

has

oeen called and organized by the SWP and its affiliate,

the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's

Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

4

NW 55090 DocId: 32989546 Page

## Page 294

NY 100-174481

SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their

political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.

And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform

of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political:

party to build itself on.

The SWP/YSA

realizes this and

is taking advantage of it.""

On August 5, 1971, a leaflet

captioned "F.O.C.A.S." revealed

in part as follows:

"A nucleus of about eight feminists

have formed FOCAS, Feminist

organization for communication,

Action and Service.

FOCAS evolved

from the Women's Strike Coalition

(WSC), which the Socialist Workers

Party abruptly abandoned on May

25th in order to form the committee

for WONAAC. Since that time a

nucleus of women from WSC together

with like-minded feminists pre-

served the WSC in order to main-

tain and expand a multi-issue

action-oriented Women's Libera-

tion coalition in the NYC area.

Assisted by loans from supporting

feminists, the new WSC paid

back nearly a thousand of the •

three thousand dollars of debts

incurred by the SWP women who

had controlled the old wSc.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five,

in an article

entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-

Baiting", revealed in part, with respect to the founding

WONAAC conference in July, 1971:

"The Militant" is a weekly news~

paper of the SWe.

NY 100-174481

"There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the

conference, and SWers and YSAers are among those who

have worked most consistently for abortion repeal and to

build the abortion conference...."

NY T-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that à NY

Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,

NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans

for a scheduled November 20, 1971 demonstration in Washington,

According to this source, this meeting was completely

dominated and controlled by members of the SWP..

NY I-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper

West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a

• contingent

of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971;

in order to participate in the planned demonstration there

on that date.

NY I-6 stated that practically all the members of the

uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate

in this activity.

NY I-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled

November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to

all SWP and

YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity

for selling of "The Militant" and other SWP/YSA literature,

also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the

action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

Ny 1-8 on February It, 191<, ana Ny I-y and Ny I-1u

on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC

convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,

at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.

"How to Win

Abortion Law Repeal". NY I-8 stated that approximately

30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were observed.

in attendance at this convention.

NY I-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the

de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON Administration,

the YSA-New York Local (NYL), while continuing on with

anti-war work through the NY Student Mobilization

Committee (SMC) and NY National Peace Action Coalition

(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate,

would

also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation

Movement through their influence in WONAAC:

The SMC is controlled by the

SWP and its youth affiliate,

YSA.

SMC initiates and supports

public demonstrations against

the war in Southeast Asia.

NPAC was founded in 1970 by

members of the SWP.

Its objec-

tive is the immediate, total

and unconditional withdrawal

of all US forces and material

in Southeast Asia.

NY T-T advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,

through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were

dutifully reported

and included on the agenda at regular

meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local

(NYL) during that period.

MY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-

ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SwP.

NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC

meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,

starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though

VIONAAC previously had accused various

female activists

working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle

of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against

the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they

are

forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen

the

WONAAC cause.

At this meeting, certain WONAAC StalI memoers

walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meetino

being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.

They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a

policy-making position in WONAAC.

NY 100-174481

NY I-7 on July 18, 1972, and NY T-11 on July 19,

1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was

at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on

July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.

NY I-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of

this convention because this city is considered to be

the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so 'far.

Discussionsheld at this conference centered on

plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two-to

end forced sterilization.

A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own

bodies.

NY I-ll related that the evening plenary session

of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately

apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.

Independent women who wanted to make statements during

this session were voted down by SWP floor leaders and

these same persons continued to vote as a block on all

issues.

The group of independent women from various

geographic areas, that is, those women who were not

associated with the SWP Or YSA, went together after the

plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

of how to handle the SWP leaders.

While these women

were not political realists in their goals, they did

believe in working throughout the existing

system rather

than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of

revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists

would no longer continue

hassling within WONAAC.

did not want to have decisions for them being structured

by a male dominated group.

They also decided that money

being collected by WONAAC

in the name of abortion law.

About 35

independents attended

and a

few number of SWP-YSA members

and sympathizers were present. Independents there were

from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,

Philadelphia, and San Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm

opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national

coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to

resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session.

also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-

ment through the various publications.

The six national coordinatoes who resigned were

JUDYXSIPHERS, San Francisco; ANN C, DAVIDSON, Philadelphia;

ROSEXWEBER, NY: VICKIXESTINGER, Columbia, South Carolina;

NANCYXROLF, NY; and ELLENASHAPIRO, NI.

There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-

dance at the afternoon session.

According to one of the

SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three

countries-Canaãa, Italy and Sweden.

The states that had

more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New

York and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWe centered around approaches to

abortion law reform. The Swe was charged with always

having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any

work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of

this hassle and that they believed there were more ef~

fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards

in the streets.

Mui

SOR OF SUDEDI CROABILIION

LINDA-JENNESS made a final plea for the indepen-

dent women to reconsider.

The removal of the independents

from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most

independent representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations

which have no connection with the sWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform

and there is also the concern that women new to the move-

ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be

furthering abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving NY that they

would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an

effort to prevent this.

III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL

STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,

1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National

Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,

inception.

EATON, while

she is definitely not a

ISA, SiP, or member of any "radical group", acknowledged

there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements

In WONAAC. She went on to state,

however, that WONAAC

has never allied itself politically with

any organization

or individual, including any of the political candidates

in the recent political election and, despite its diverse

makeup

as too ideological beliefs of its membership,

WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only

to the objectives for which it was originally founded.

To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from

whatever source offered.

A:

10

NW 55090 DocId: 32989546 Page 299

---

## Page 300

NY 100-174481

EATON admitted there were some problems in

the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP

YSA influence. She stated, however, this matter, to

her observation, never seemed a serious one, and is quite

minimal today.

With regard to the "walk out" of six

national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,

she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because

of the SW/YSA influence question, but rather because

those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a referral

agency", while those who stayed felt it should not.

BY

referral agency, EATON statedshe means an agency which would refer

callers to a specific location or place where abortions

could be obtained.

IV. PLANNED PROJECTS

CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-

national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, Ny, from March 9,

1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been

finalized, including the exact location or site this event

will take

place.

However, she noted that SIMONEyBEAUVOIR,

a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberation Movement,

would be honorary chairwoman.

(00: NY)

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7

to New York, 7/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,

2/28/73.

As outlined in referenced New York letter, the

New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it

recognized that, although several leaders of WONAAC were

known to be SWP members,

their activities, as pertaining to

"SONAAC, had been directed toward the legal

repeal of all

restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed

no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in

any subversive or vidence

prone activity.

Referenced Bureau 0-7, referencing the aforementioned

communication, nevertheless instructed that the New York Office,

as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned

organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its

case and submit semi-annual reports:

A review of the results of the continuing investigation

Of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining

thereto, since June 1972, reflects no apparent change in the

activities or the organization o its membership irom that

outlined above.

The New York Office is in accord with the view of the

Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,

that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,

despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,

deals with the single issue of abortion rights.

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau

memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the

Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest

in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate

dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision

upholding the right to abortion, it appears continued

investigation of WONANC as such

is not justified.

The New York Office further concurs with the

Philadelphia view that continued investigati on of the SWP

and/or YSA would produce the desired coverage and information

concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC.

UACB, the New York Office is closing the investigation

of this organization.

NEW YORK

RePElet 2/28/73.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC)

has been the subject of a separate investigation by the Bureau

in nunerous offices.

In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed

out that VONAAC represents a basic social change dealing with

abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U,S. Supreme

Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation

OE HONAAC at this time does not appear to be desirable and

should be discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that

continued investigation of the Socialist Workers party (SWP)

and its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), should

determine pertinent activities of FONAAC.

After caraiul consideration ot this matter, the sureau

agrees wiin the observations of the railadelphia ottice that the

investigation of WONAAC should

be discontinued.

However, in view

ot the Iac that wonade is donnated and controlled by the swe, a

trotsiyise conmunist arganization cited by the Attorney Ganera

pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the

Bureau to investigate and repori pertinent intornation relating

to the extent of SWP domination and control of captioned

organization.

Therefore, recipients should close separate

investigations concerning MONAC.

In the future, report above-

described intornation regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading

in the Sip semiannual organizational reports.

For the information of New York, referenced Bureau

The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be

by the FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania.

This article reflected, in part; as follows:

"Out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying

to channel our frustration into a

"We are making this march one step in showing the

who are fighting for their lives. The Committee to Defend the

woman from the New York (NY) group was already in Washington,

D.C. working with others there to arrange permits, speakers,

et cetera, for the womens march on the Pentagon on April 10,

1971. It

no permit had been obtained as yet.

It was pointed out that

a march from the Pentagon to the Justice Department was

Law Commune

on september 10, 1909, a second source, who

has furnished reliable information in the

past, advised that the law Commune is not an

organization in the usual sense of the word.

It is rather a law firm comprised of a group

of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the

New Left and Black Power organizations, and who

counsel and defend individuals in these groups

as the occasion arises.

They likewise permit

their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting

place for these organizations and distribute

some of their literature.

on March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of

now there is much confusion over the mechanical aspects of

the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the

people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision

regarding the route of the march.

The source stated that

in NY, information concerning buses for washington, D.C.

will be available at the Upper West Side Women's Center,

627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696.

on March 24, 1971, the second source made available

a piece of literature

sent out by the "April 10 Women's

Committee" concerning the national women's march on the

Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as

follows:

"We are going to the pentagon on April 10 to

serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against

them.

Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the

Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black

and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now.

We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday

things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents

us

from getting them.

"We need and want our sisters around the country

to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate

with other sisters their ideas,

suggestions and criticisms.

This is a temporary contact list which came out of the Ann

Arbor Conference:

APPENDIX

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an

initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist-

• Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up

the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism

and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North

as countries leading the worldwide struggles

against the United States.

However, the Soviet Union

was regarded as imperialist ina with the Communist Party,

United States of America, "I visionist" in nature.

SDS operated under a national constitution which

called for an annual Nationa Convention (NC) and quarterly

National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated

and debated.

Three national officers were elected

annually

with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.

Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to

the national meetings but each functioned independently on

local

matters.

Its official publicition

' "Fire" (formerly

"New Left Notes") last appeared in lecember, 1969.

Internal factionalism of

serious proportions

developed during 1968 - 1969 and tle following three factions

evolved as a result of a split at he June, 1969, NC:

Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM). The effect of the split on SDS chapters

throughout the country was divisive.

Some aligned with one

of the other of the three major factions. Others, unable to

identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS completely

and changed names.

The SDS national office in recent years was

located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. It

was closed in February, 1970.

WEATHERMAN

* +

Initially called the "iction Faction," Weatherman

came into being immediately before the June, 1969, Students

for a Democratic Society (SiS) liational Convention (NC) •

At this NC weatherman won all three national officer positions

and a majority of the National Interin Committee as well.

subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)

in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national

records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,

Weatherman For all major purposes controlled Sos nationally

from June, 1969, until its 10 closed in february, 1970. At

this time it no longer considered itself part of

SDS.

The term Weatherman emerged fion an ideological

paper prepared by its leaders entitled "You Don't need a

Weatherman to know which way

' the Wind Blows" ("New Left

Notes" June 18, 1969). This statement outlined the basic

stance of Weatherman: Marxist-Leninist in content but with

strong advocacy that action not theory vould bring about

revolution in the United States.

This posture was conplemonted

with an international identification to the Cuban revolution

and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is

to make revolution.

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in

Chicago resulted in more than

260 arrests for nob action

and related charges.

A program of

armer struggle was

finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein

terrorist tactics and political assassination were

contemplated.

The basic strength of Weatherman was then

revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically

apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.

As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman

leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of

an underground

operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization

would

would function independently.

In February, 1970, Weatherman

leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with

police and military installations as primary targets.

In February, 1370, Weatherman abandoned

Source further advisel that during late Summer,

1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National

Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of

a loft-type

building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

centered was to build

a worker student alliance or a campus worker student

alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student

Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.

in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA

faction.

A second source advised during January, 1970,

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,

from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was

decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist

youth organization, said organization being proposed as

separate and distinct in form and content from SDS.

a a got and con

The

"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a

struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy; fights

against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression

of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of

the note recen operators

all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all

"oppressed and exploited"

peoples "to armed self-defense."

It was agreed that RYM would not be a Marxist-Leninist

organization; however, source said this was decided in order

to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be

acceptable to everyone.. A temporary National Steering

Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was

elected to govern RYM until national officers could be

elected during the Spring of 1970.

RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office

(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,

both Atlanta, Georgia, and

a second source has advised that

the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as

located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.

Second source advised that women dominated the

founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC

meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently

become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor

financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish

a paper.

During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to

the working class rather than youth, since the potential for

social revolution

lies

in workers.

A third source has stated that it was decided at

the March, 1970, NSC meeting

that RYM women had decided

the

organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-

Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack

nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

A characterization of the SDS

is set out separately.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday,

April 20, 1965, Page 27,

"revolutionary socialism" was formally founded on April 18,

1965, under the name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP),

which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor

Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER

SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of

the United States for assertedly following the Chinese

Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP

held its Second National Convention in New

York City, May 31,

to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its

objective

of the

establishment of a militant working class

movement based on Marxism-Leninism.

The source also advised that at the Second National

Convention, MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National

Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,

WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON and WALTER LINDER

were elected

as the National Committee to lead the PLP until

the next convention.

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly

magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper.

Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP

utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,

New York, and also utilizes an office in Room 617, 1 Union

According to information received from the Washington Field

plans a March on the Pentagon" on Saturday, 4/10/71, as an anti-war protest.

Plans call for the protesters, who may number as many as 5, 000, to assemble

at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets,

Northwest, between 11:00 a.m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon

via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled

to end around 5:00 p.m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses

capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washingta. The

busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported the

women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point

for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesters

are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another

demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon.

General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security

officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street

Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday.

Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-

sary.

Unless otherwise stated, all sources in

this memorandum have furnished reliable

information in the past.

on March 30, 1971, a fist confidential source

furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which

was picked up at the

Upper Westside Womens Center, 627

The literature captioned,

argued that the

women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should

not exist and that "the Women's House of Detention, along with the

prisons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the

power structure here

of poor communities. "in America to oppress and exploit the people

It further relates that "women have come

together in New York from many different organizations to form a

Women's

Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of

Detention. The Bail Fund is also working to prepare simple

pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal

resources in

the House of Detention and secure legal assistance

where needed." The address is listed as the women's Bail Fund,

P.0. Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10003.

on August 26, 1971, the first source furnished

literature on the Women's Bail Fund which stated, "The Women's

Bail Fund is a coalition of Third World and white women who are:

".....raising bail to release women prisoners from

Rikers Island.

"...establishing communication with women inside.

"

... assisting women who are bailed out in meeting

their needs.

On April 12, 1911, a secona confidential source

made available a flyer on the women's Bail Fund which was

distributed at the National Womens March on the Pentagon on

"Victory to the NLF and All

The flyer "women in Vietnam and in the United

States are fighting for the right to live: for the very right

to exist..... the U.S. is now dotted with concentration camps for

the poor

and

non-white: the jails.... But imprisonment doesnt'

break the spirit of the sisters in

jail. They resist!

When denied

their dignity, they organize and fight back. When one sister is

beaten they organiz

and resist. In the coldest part of winter

when the boilers had broken down,

the women worked in freezing

temperatures in cold water to do

the laundry-not 'because the

pigs made us do it - but for our 'own beautiful sisters.' .....We

Vietnamese, Black, Latin, White and Asian-american women are

united in our struggle - we share common goals and face a common

enemy.

We express our complete solidarity with the NLF and shall

work to bring the victory

there."

on May 14, 1971, Special Agents (SAS) of the Federal

Bureau of Invesigation (FBI observed a demonstration in front

of the NYC Women's House of Detention sponsored by the Women's

Bail Fund and Youth Against war and Fascism (YAWE).

demonstrators chanted slogans calling for release

of their

"sisters" from jail and expressed opposition to a proposed move

of the inmates of the Women's House of Detention from its

downtown site to the Rikers Island Prison Facility.

demonstrators called this proposed

move an attempt to isolate

the "sisters from their supporters."

By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to

several inmates of the House of Detention who appeared in the

upper storey windows, obtained their names ma place of arrest.

This information allegedly was to be used to obtain bail for the

prisoners in question. Thereafter, several speakers denounced

the jails as concentration camps and called for the release of the

"political prisoners.

"in the House of Detention. Among the

speakers was Shirley Taylor of the Women's Bail Fund and a

former inmate of the Women's House of Detention.

is affiliated with the Women's Bail Fund (WBF).

the "Liberated Guardian

Organizing Our Anger"

, written by live unidentified members

of the Women's Bail Fund Collective..

The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a

group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women

out of jail (150 so far).

They have been organized for over

a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20,

involved in the prison struggle.

They have been active in supporting other groups

They do legal follow-up

for bailed-out sisters who want it and have been talking

with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who

the real enemies are, etcetera."

The article is introduced by the following

statement:

"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves.

So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from

as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these

reflections in this article, using the words from their raps."

The article, being reflections of the various

members of the group?

is a series of quotes by unidentified

members

concerning the WBF.

The following are reflections of some WBF

members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots - Why

We Started - Why We Joined"

"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising

group who was in the bail fund when it was first getting

started and she talked with others about it.

To some of

1s it was a very exciting ldea.

To others it was

Frightening - connecting to political activity as women.

Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on

whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness

to any sort of feminist political action or not.

"In the past, I was politically frustrated because

I was only involved in one-shot actions. I saw what was

happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress

black_people and that resulted inalot of pain for me.

felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.

I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware

of that need.

"When sisters want us

to, we go to court with them.

When I go to court I tind that it can do bad things to my

head.

I make judgements like this jude is better than another

but it's all shit. All

judges are pigs. Or like

feeling good that a sister got six months instead of five

years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.

"I was in the House of Detention when there was the

bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970: The whole

tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she

let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows.

the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.

They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated

and intimidated about chanting.

But all the women kept it

up. Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration

was different than other demonstrations. There had been more

contact.

The women saw Afeni and Joan and another woman

that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.

That was real important.

"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund

banner with the address made it real that people were serious

about supporting people inside. It wasn't going to be a

one-shot deal.

So much of what we do is short-term support

stuff that can be seen as reformist.

when prisoners ralse

people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be

reformist.

I have done a whole lot of courtroom work.

both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole

social work thing is what I come out of,

which is why it

is so hard for me to deal with all this

('cause I obviously

reflect a lot of that

back in the late 1800's and Social work when it started

early 1900's came out of real

radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such. And

when you read MAO, he talks about service to the people

as a revolutionary thing.

But for us it feels weird

because it has been co-opted.

I think that the movement

now,

trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that

original sense of service to the people, trying

to help

people survive.

"One of the ways to really keep ourselves.

out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in

more political education among ourselves and to ask other

groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we

should be more involved in educating other people.

"We should be doing more for women inside. We

need to really work on facilitating communications

setween the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners

have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is

because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.

Concretely, we need to write more letters to find out what

is going on, send literature, but also tell the women about

each other, about what other women are thinking and feeling.

This would stop the sense of isolation and increase the

sense of solidarity.

"I think much of the movement is guilty of

ultra-leftism. In China the Communists worked on a lot

of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately

wanted.

We're too afraid of being contaminated by being

involved in reform movements.

We too often define our

enemies too broadly and our

allies too narrowly.

"I've been real impressed with what women in the

group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they

fulfill those commitments.

And that atmosphere of res-

ponsibility affects new members too. This is real

important.

It helps me through the rough times and all

the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.

You really have a sense that everyone really wants to work

things through, search for solutions, wants to hold

together because we feel responsible for the work. "Even

the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are

sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain

why they have to

stop doing work for a while, shows

people's commitment and responsibility."

The "Liberated Guardian" was created in

April, 19/0, through active and violent

dissent

against the politics and policies

of the "Guardian"

• Its major aims were

to produce a "more revolutionary" paper,

to operate collectively within it and to

maintain by design a loose political position.

The "Guardian" is self-described as an

"independent radical newsweekly" which

takes

a strong left position but is not

identified with any organized group. It

is considered to be the largest radical

weekly in America.

both from the Defense Bail Fund, were also expected at

the meeting. Clark discussed the tact that the wBr

has no common politics and no common political direction

at this point and the WBF could become a defense committee,

not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack

of any other direction.

on 11/20/72, NY 7615-S advised the Women's Bail Fund

(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the

movement in New York City.

A review of the subject file discloses there is no

structure to the wBF and that it is a coalition of women who

belong to various groups in the New York City area, whose main

purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.

It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted

those involved in the bail fund.

However, have decryed the

lack

of political direction of

the WBF and would like to turn

it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other

direction. There is no indication that this has occurred, and

the bail fund still remains a loose coalition of like-minded /:

individuals from various groups seeking to raise funds for.

various purposes.

Because of its lack of common political dir-:

ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in

the movement.

In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-

gation in this matter to be reopened upon receipt of pertinent

information from sources that the bail fund is being redirected

Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN

DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE

100-450998)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of

Boston investigation based on his participation in a

"Teach-In"

and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the

Arlington St. Church, Boston, During the above activity:

DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance

Group" and turned in what was reported so be Selective

Service cards..

The primary function of the Resistance Group

was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the

draft.

EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore

College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/0/06 majoring it economics.

He was acrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/64 and was charged

with disorderly conduct.

The 1968-09 Harvard University Directory of

Ofiicers and Students retlected that DELLINGER was enrolled

in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,

Mass.

It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER waS

present at a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Street Meeting

in New York City on 7/21/64.

The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the

Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-

GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that.

his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were

pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not

warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-

tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed

status.

A review of Boston file 25-25585 (Bufile 25-569484)

Rededication Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston

on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a

Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.

Two other individuals turned in some other type of, document.

It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective

Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-

fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,

a two-page statement signed PATCHEN DELLINGER supporting

the Resistance movement was turned in.

In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-..

tion concerning DELLINGER.

On 8/21/72, personnel of the Office of the Mass.

On 3/6/73, WE IO27S, advised that for all intents

and purposes the "Furies" organization and collective have

ceased to function. There are no plans to publish another

newspaper, and most of the members have left to pursue their

own interests.

As reported in re WO report, investigation of this

case did not reflect any activities on

the part of the "Furies"

that would be considered revolutionary or subversive.

The "Furies" newspaper ceased publication in August,

1972, and did not espouse a radical revolutionary line.

In view of the above, this case is being closed.

WFO will remain alert for information regarding any possible

future activity on the part of the "purles", and will repper
