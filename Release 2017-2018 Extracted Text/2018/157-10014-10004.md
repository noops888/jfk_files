Senator Schweiker. Mr. Angleton, the first thing
do is swear you in.

Will you stand and raise your right hand, please?

Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to
give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

Mr. Angleton. I do.

Senator Schweiker. As you know, since you have been
here before, a Senator is normally present at all times during!
the testimony. However, with the press of Senate duties we
have not been able to effectuate that fully. So if I have
to leave -- and I will have to.leave for at least a substantial
portion -- you have the right to hold up your testimony until
a Senator is returned.

S0 would you be willing to proceed without a Senator
present?

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

And I understand that I am entitled to the draft of
the testimony?

Senator Schweiker. Yes. We let every witness see it
and correct it. So there is no problem there whatever

Mr. Angleton. To me it is immaterial one way or the

other.

TESTIMONY OF JAMES ANGLETON

Mr. Johnson. Mr. Angleton, would you please state
your name, address and organization for the record?

Mr. Angleton. James Ancleton, Arlington, Virginia,
and no organization.

Mr. Johnson. May the record show that Senator Richard
Schweiker of Pennsylvania is present, and staff members Loch
Johnson and Paul Wallach.

Mr. Angleton, I want to make sure that before we start
you understand that you have certain rights under the law and
under the Committee Rules of Procedure. Although this is not
a criminal investigation, do ;yyou know you have the Fifth Amend~
ment right to be silent in answer to questions if the answer
might tend to incriminate you?

Mr. Angleton. I do.

Mr. Johnson. Do you understand that you may be
accompanied by counsel?

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Johnson, Are you appearing here todav fre

arily without counsel?

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Johnson. Are you aware that you may stop at any
point during the examination and request counsel?

Mr. Angleton, Yes. :

Mr. Johnson. I would like you during the preceeding to!

Mr. Angleton, do you wish to make a bricf opening
statement before we begin to talk about the Huston Plan?

Mr Angleton. No, I really don't. I say that because
as of the end of December, just’shortly before Christmas, I
have had not really had much access to my files, basically in
the sense that a legman necessarily would pull things together:

I imagine that with the number of personnel the Rockefeller

Commission had, the number of personnel that you had, that
you will get all the relevant documents.

Senator Schweiker. I hope we do. We will sure try it.

Mr. Angleton. The Huston Plan is literally about five-

eighths of an inch thick, and I think half of it is a blue-

covered report. In other words, there is nothing much

by way of files.

Mr. Johnson. I like to forget by tracing chronologically
the events surrounding the so-called Wuston plan. And it is
understanding that the first import nt ‘event in this episode
has to do with a meeting held in the President's office on
June 5, 1970. And at this meeting were the principals of
the intelligence community, of course, including Mr. Helms

present?

TOP SECRET
When did you first hear about this meeting, if in _
fact you did hear about it?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think the first news came
when Helms called me, and I believe it was with Tom Kara-
messines, and simply stated that there would be a rather extra
ordinary meeting in the White House. I think he did mention!
the principals being the Executive of the USIB
and Mr. Hoover. And that the President made some very strong!
statements’ regarding the aack of domestic intelligence on the
incidents of the time. And therefore, that he had set up --
wanted a working group set up by the principles. And in
the course of this discussion, which was very short, he
nominated me to be the agency representative, and Dick Ober
to be my legman.

Mr. Johnson. Did Mr. Helms give you any additional
feeling for what that meeting was about?

Mr. Angleton. lic didn't really haye to, because the
question of what was going on in the country was burning in
every investigative agency or agency in government. In
other words, it was not -- the Huston Plan was jist simply the
momentum of what was happening in the country.

Mr. Johnson. Couldyou be more explicit when you say
what was happening in the country?

Mr, Angleton. Well, the question of bombings, the

questions of protest, the question of travel abroad -~ all

the things which a contemporary newspaper would set forth, |
and the statistics which Director Kelley can give you ad nauseum,

on which there was not coverage. To put it bluntly, as it!

Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

came through to me -- and this is the reason I think the
thing was rather short -~ it was a question everybody was
asking themselves, basically, that the President of the U.S.
did not feel-he had any answers, and, therefore, was more an
anger in reaction to the inability of the country to give
him answers.

Mr, Johnson. So the summer of 1970 there was perceived
to be a definite internal security threat?

Mr. Angleton. It had been growing for a long time.

Mr. Johnson. As the leading counter intelligence

expert in the CIA, did you have any concrete evidence yourself!

a SEY SORES ES Sui dence yourselt
that there was a foreign connection to this domestic uorest?

Mr. Angleton. The way I would comment on that is

i

ly

simply that the intelligence that we had gathered, fundamental
from December '61 on through, that the counter intelligence
effort in the government was very important.

Mr. Johnson. Does that include the effort of the
Central Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Angleton. Absolutely.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Johnson, Before the telephone rang we were talking

about the inadequacies of the counter intelligence effort

TOP SECRET



in this country to include that of the CIA.

why was the effort in this area inadequate in your

Mr. Angleton. I think the reason it was inadequate
was simply that we did not have the quality of sources
to whom we could turn to resolve these problems
Fundamentally, the degree to which the Soviet bloc
was taking advantage or stimulating the unrest in this country.
In other words, we were dealing where everyone had a
hypothesis based on holdings, which was quite a different
thing from having a live source who could in fact tell you
what was going on.
Mr. Johnson. $0 in response to the President's concera
about foreign connections over domestic unrest,the answer
of the CIA, at any rate, was that we are not sure, because:
we don't have adequate sources to answer that question?
Mr. Angleton. I don't. think, that necessarily follows,
because I wasn't present when the President was present
Mr. Johnson. Let me rephrase the question, then. ™y
earlier question was, what was the degree of foreign influence

over domestic unrest?

Mr. Angleton. Well, that's a long -- I am prepared to

give you a written paper on that, but to try to verbally
reconstruct all of the scene of that period is very difficul:

for me at this moment. We had bombings going on, and there

TOP SECRET



prune (eee 202) 544-6000

TOP SE

was travel abroad, and the dissident groups -- there was a
whole series of literally hundreds of incidents. The whole
question came up because of what we knew, from 1961 regard-
ing Soviet’ bloc political action. In other words, the
most important development in the Soviet bloc was the re-
orientrzion of their services into their respective central
committees to make a return to Leninist principles, that
every intelligence operation must have a political objective

So, the verbiage of the day, and the intelligence we
had on Communist Parties, plus what we knew on secret
sources, we could hypothicate in terms of the civil unrest
and the travel of Americans abroad. Our weakness was anyone
in the American department's concern who could give us the
black and white answers as to what groups and what was going
on.

Mr. Johnson. I have looked at some reports presented
to the White House in 1969 by the FBI and the CIA, and those
reports conclude that there is little concrete evidence

of foreign support, although there was a potential for

such support to increase in the future. I am just wondering

Mr. Angleton. I don't know what reports you are re~
rring to. All I can say is that there was obviously a
very cautious approach to this when it was dealing with
the subject which might result in another Presidential re-

action.

SECRET



In other words, you had to be able to prove it, and I
can well understand that any reports going in prior to this

meeting would be hedged, because within the Agency itself therd
were those who took a very staunch stand that there was no
foreign involvement.

Again, they had no more information than we had that
would justify their position. And these were fairly senior in-
dividuals, mainly on the overt side of the business. Their
attitude was very definitely that there was nothing to it.

Mr. Johnson. But you have indicated to me, if I am
reading you properly, that there were gaps in intelligence
concerning the degree of foreign influence over domestic un
rest.

Is that inaccurate?

Mr. Angleton. No, that is an accurate statement, and

it goes back again to what I described to be a source who

would have access to information that comes into the

first chief director of the xe that deals with American
problems.

Mr. Jonnson. Why is it that we didn't have such
sources?

Mr. Angleton. I can't answer that

Mr. Johnson. What I am driving at, is whether or

not the intelligence agencies are constrained or fettered by

barriers to collecting quality intelligence, and if so, what

TOP SEC



Prune (eas 207) 544-6000

TOP SECRET
these barriers are.

Mr. Angleton. There were no barriers as such. I mean,
speaking from the foreign point of view, it is just simply
that the target is one of the most difficult ones that one
can concedve of, because you are dealing with a police state,
unless they are on internal security, and with a degree of
efficiency that simply doesn't fit in with Western terms.

Mr. Johnson. What are the topics that apparently
were discussed at this June 15 meeting at the White House?
what was the degree of cooperation between the CIA and the
FBI, in particulare the liaison between the two agencies?
What was your feeling about the quality of liaison between the
FRI and the CIA in June of 1970?

Mr. Angleton. This still doesn't have the official
date on it?

Mr. Johnson. I understand that: in May of 1970 Mr.
Hoover terminated the official liaison.

Mr. Angleton.’ Well, naturally this was a very big blow
to every one concerned.

Mr. Johnson. It was more than a symbolic gesture,

Mr. Angleton. Absolutely. And it wasn't on a terminat-

ing liaison with CIA, it was a termination, as I recall, of

all liaison in government with the exception of the White

House.



Prone trea 202) 544-6000

TOP SECRET oe
Mr. Johnson. So in May of 1970 we had a very serious
rupture in relationships between the CIA -~
Mr. Angleton. If that is the accurate date of the
Colorado Case, there was a very serious rupture.
Mr. Johnson. In what sense was it serious? I wonder

if you could elaborate.

Mr. Angleton. Well, fundamentally liaison is misleading,

a misleading word, because the fruits of liaison are obtained
through daily contact.

In other words, it is a creative process, it is not
a static thing of a post office box. It means that cases
are discussed, argued, mectings are held, and it is a type
cf creative process that you cannot reduce to paper in
correspondence.

Mr. Johnson. Of course,there was the telephone.
Couldn't the same kind of conversations take place over
secure telephones?

Mr. Angleton. Impossible.

Mr. Johnson. So in face to face liaison is quite im-
portant in your opinion?

Mr. Angleton. It is essential, because it is a
process of one side supplying the gaps to the other side,
which could not prior to thatmeeting have been identified.
It is only when all the case from one side is laid out, and

then you have a rebuttal, and so on, and you define future

courses of investigation, and you reconsider actions that

A2

were going to take place. You simply do not have enough
stenographers in Washingtm to keep up to date with that type
of give and take.

Mr. Johnson. It is my understanding that Sam Papich

fulfilled thie role of liaison with the FBI for a long
period of time.
Were you his contact in the CIA for liaison purposes?
Mr. Angleton. Well, the history of the liaison is that
it started back in the days of Admiral Hillencotter with

Ben DeLoach, and he was eventually -- his successor became

Papich, whose alternate was from San Francisco,

and so Papich took it over, I believe, around 1952, and was

and later up until the incident

in Colorado in which it was terminated.

Mr. Johnson. And how often would you get together
personally with these individuals to discuss interagency
problems?

Mr. Angleton, Well, I would say that Sam had two contacts~
excuse me -- he had the following contacts. He had contact
with my liaison section, headed by Mrs. Jane Roman, and
this dealt with the broad routine business of the agency, much
of it not so routine when you deal with operational cases

His other contact would be with the Office of Security,

which eventually became, to my knowledge, so burdensome that

of Security, plus Bill Creager was handling many of the
interagency committees representing USIB and many others. He was
a perennial person sent to the committees interagency-wise. |
And then Papich'’s contact was with myself and my
various deputies. That was on a daily basis approximately
Mr. Johnson. In the summer of 1970 it seems to me, then,
the country and the intelligence community faced these
facts of life: proncunced domestic unrest; inability to
completely u:derstand the degree of foreign connections over
domestic unrest; and a severing of relationships between the
FBI and the rest of the intelligence community.
Mr. Angleton. With the exception of the White House.
Mr. Johnson. With the exception of the White House.
Were there any other factors that we can bring up as
background in this situation of June 1970 that would be
particularly relevant?
Mr. Angleton. There would be also the allegations
made by bloc defectors, which was maintained at a counter
intelligence level, and was never injected into the body poli-
tic.
In other words, counter intelligence people were aware
of. the allegations made, and yet there was a great difference
of opinion as to the validity of those assertions

Mr. Johnson. What allegations are you thinking of?

TOP SECRET



je4 702) 544-6000

Mr. Angleton. I am referring to the allegations of the
activities of the KGB and the bloc services. In other words,
let's take a simple one. That is whether Rumania was

independent of the Soviet bloc or not, and this had, of course

|
1
far-reaching political impact, because President Nixon had a yes

cial relationship with Rumania. The estimators were taking |
the position that Rumania was in a position comparable to
Tito when he broke with Stalin.

Now, on the counter intelligence level this couldn't
be supported.

First, it couldn't be supported by way of information
derived from defectors. as
And second, there were too many cases which were in

fact exposed which showed the most intimate relationship

between the Soviet and Rumanian intelligence services. And

So, we have cases that we know about in 1961, without
knowing the name of the agent, and one in France in parti-

cular. If our identification is correct -- this is infor-

mation, I might add, that we passed to the lin 1962 --

there was 4 French ex-Colonel who was being operated by the

Soviets and the and they gave other

descriptions of the person without a name.

Subsequently, after some years, we acquired the man's

real name, and we passed it to the They picked him

up and he acknowledged that he was an agent. He acknowledged

the broad outlines of the allegation.

He was taken by two people

to his apartment and while they were searching his quarters,

he jumped out of the window and committed suicide.

1
So there hus never been a thorough interrogation of him, ;

but by tracking on our information, and trying to reconstruct 1

his activities, it showed very clearly that the jand

Soviet services were working hand in glove, and that the

were not reluctant -- that the quality of their FEI's

essential elements of intelligence, ‘were for the Warsaw '

Pact.
Now, we had several other cases in NATO of very

deep penetrations into the most highly classified information

breaking up an entire network and expelling people

Now, these were issues, that if you accept them as being

more accurate than the so-called overt manifestations of the

And, therefore, we had sources that stated this was a
part of the reorientation of 1959, of presenting a type of
wilderness of mirrors to the West, and to encourage the West
to deal with these countries independently of one another.

so, this again permeated the counter intelligence
picture, not only in Washington, but in all allied capitols,
and it was part and parcel of the kind of counter intelligence
wpectrum, where you could never come to grips at resolving
these matters. :

one of the reasons simply was that counter intelligence
did not have a voice at any policy level in the government
and the Bureau could go along with their views, and we could
go along with our views, but there wasn't any third party
statue who banged heads together and imposed time factors as
to when these issues should be resolved one way or the
other.

We lived with this from 1961, 1962 on, in all leverls

of intelligence.

Mr. Johnson. Do you think that Tom Charles Huston

viewed himself as a pote ial arbitor for domestic intelligence

for domestic security.

Mr. Johnson. I believe Mr. Angleton is referring to

a July 1970 memorandum.

Mr. Angleton. That is correct.

Mr, Johnson. What directions did Mr. Helms give to you,
if any, concerning how you ought to respond as the Chief
CIA representative to the work group sessions held to
draft a report for the President on intelligence problems?

Mr. Angleton. He didn't give me necessarily any
instruction. He just simply stated that the President had
outlined his needs, that Huston would in due course call a
meeting. He may have stated that the FBI would chair the
meeting, and he attended the first meeting.

Mr. Johnson. Who attended i elms?

Mr. Angleton. Mr. Helms. But he attended only for a

few moments. Huston made the opening remarks, as I recall,

and since it was being ia in our building, Helms made a br

appearance, $0 tO speak, the host. And ne took off, and

rt don't think from that moment on he attended any other meetings.

i
Mr. Johnson... Could you tell me your impressions of thd

relationship between Mr. Sullivan, who was chairman of this

work group, and Mr. Huston, who was the White House reprcsentay

tive to this work group?

Mr. Angleton. Well, it was my understanding that they H
had known one another for some time prior to this, and
that Sullivan was seeing a great deal of Mr. Huston on domestic
intelligence problems. And that would be -- I don't know
how natural and normal it is. I know that since they main-
tained the open link of liaison to the White House, there were
probably a great number of reports going to the White House
from the Bureau directly.

I would assume that within the White House staff that
as the work was parceled out, that fluston was probably the
recipient, and as a recipient would bring him in touch with
the domestic intelligence, in those days the Internal Security
pivision of the FBI, which was headed by Mr. Sullivan.

Mr. Johnson. Would it be fair to say that Mr. Sullivan,
who had a great deal of experience in counter intelligence,
was cultivating the relatively inexperienced Mr. lluston
and perhaps tutoring him on the difficulties that the in-
telligence community faced in obtaining the kind of infor-
mation the President wanted regarding foreign connections

over domestic unrest?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I wouldn't characterize it that

TOP SECRET

I would say that Bill Sullivan -~ that he was a person that Hl

would postulate a position, and then it would be in his nature

to propagate it, I don't think that. Bill Sullivan ever

prone (Aree 202) 544-6000

propagated anything that he didn't believe in very deeply.
I. know that he was extremely frustrated and I think part
of his frustration was what the counter intelligence always
encountered, and that is that there are no higher forums
that take into account the finding of counter intelligence.

In other words, it tends to feed on itself, because
unlike espionage, which is conducted for the purpose of —_
disseminating information to customers, counter intelligence
produces intelligence for its own consumption. and, therefore,
it tends to be blocked off, and there is no question that
Billy who spent many ‘years, Bill Sullivan, who spent many y2ars
in the battle, underwent the frustrations that everybody
did. I dare say that he found a kindred spirit with

Huston, which is reflected in the correspondence that has

been published between Huston, Ehrlichman, Haldeman, and so on,

Mr. Johnson. I wonder if you could be more explicit about
the frustrations that Mr. Sullivan might have -been propa-
gating to Mr. Huston.

Are you referring to Mr. Hoover's raising of barriers
to certain intelligence collection techniques?

report a little bit later, But initially I wonder if you
could give me your recollection about the personalities in-
volved and who seemed to be setting the agenda for this
meeting, and what the role of the NSA generally speaking was,
and the DIA, and the CIA, and the FBI? ~~

Can we point to a motivating force here, a certain group
that was leading the operation?

Mr. Angleton, You haven't one of the tables of or-
ganization of that group so that I anigee the names?

Mr. Johnson. Yes, I do.

Let's take a short recess.

(Recess.)

Mr.Johnson. Back on the record.

Based on your recollection of the individuals involved
in the work group sections at Langley, I wonder if you could
give us a feel for the role that the various spokesmen played
at that meeting?

For example, John Downie as a representative of the
Army. ‘

Mr. Angleton. Well, going down the list, naturally the
key individual was Bill Sullivan of the FBI.

Mr, Johnson. Why was he the key individual?

Mr. Angleton. He was the key individual because Mr.

Hoover was the Chairman, and he was representing Mr. Hoover |

dealt with domestic activities in the FBI.
Mr. Johnson, Did Mr. Sullivan bring to the meeting a
distinct point of view on the problem of intelligence gaps?
Mr. Angleton. Yes, very deeply. He was probably one of
the most cognizant.
Mr. Johnson. What was his viewpoint, as you recall it?
Mr. Angleton. Well, his viewpoint, I think, was the one
echoed by Huston. And I think that to recast this,

Huston was the authority present, because he came cloaked

with White House authority.

Mr. Johnson. He was certainly not the authority when
it came to inter-intelligence, and the problems that cr
specialists faced?

Mr. Angleton. No, he was very knowledgeable. He had

obviously gone into this matter at some length prior to the
meeting. He knew precisely what none of us really knew, thee
is, the depth of White House concern. In fact, the

most dramatic moment, I think, was at the beginning

of one meeting, or =t some stage in the meetings, after a
preliminary draft had been put forward, he found it totally
unacceptable, and his comments were to the effect that the
subcommittee was not being responsive to the President's

needs.

Mr. Johnson, I wonder if you couid explain this to me.

Mr. Sullivan was Mr. Hoover's representative, and Mr. Hoover |

tended to agree with Mr. Huston's point of view, which was

that restraints needed to be carefully scrutinized, and
quite possibly lowered.
So I am wondering why Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Hoover's re-
presentative, didn't reflect Mr. Hoover's point of view?
Mr. Angleton. He obviously didn't agree with him.

Mr. Johnson. Wasn't that a rather difficult situation

for Mr.Sullivan to be in, then?
Mr. Angleton. I don't know. You would hve to ask
him. He didn't seem to manifest any difficulties with his

role.

one hand, but wishing to lower restraints on the other hand.
Mr. Angleton. He may have. But it doesn’t stick out,
in my mind. I think he played this role very straight.
Mr. Johnson. ~ Po you remember there being a
military point of view at this meeting?
Mr. Angleton. No. Downie -- the one remark that
Downie made -- and he may have made it more than once, about
which he expanded at some length, was that he couldn't even

afford to keep the minutes of the meetings in his own office.

And then he went on to some length about the troubles the
military had. I think it had to do with ROTC rioting, and a
tremendous number of other civil acts against the military.
And he believed that up through the non-commissioned officers
that the thing would be leaked, to the detriment of the Army,
or the Pentagon. He posed questions as to how he was going
to be able to take it up to higher authority within the
Pentagon, and really, this was the dilemma which he kept
pounding on, that he didn't know how he was going to
handle the paper, and he didn't know how he was going to
play any role in it, because of the discontent wihin the
Defense establishment, the draftees and what not, the cleri-
cal, and non-commissioned officer.

Mr. Johnson. wi did you feel on a more conceptual
evel about the role of the military insisting domestic
intelligence collection.

Mr. Angleton.’ ie thought that in recruiting centers
and campuses of ROTC, and places where intelligence existed,
that there was a real problem.

Mr, Johnson. And did he see a role for the military
in actively assisting in the gathering of domestic intelli-
gence to find out here about domestic unrest.

Mr. Angleton. Yes, a lot of it had to do with aetivi-
ties against the Pentagon, against soldiers.

Mr. Johnson. But isn't it true that during this period

the military was under severe criticism for earlier civilian
surveillance programs?

Mr. Angleton. From where?

3
Mr. Johnson, I believe the military was preparing for

hearings before Sam Ervin's Committee on the subject of milit-j

ary surveillance over civilians, | To some degree the mili-

|
|
i

tary was under public criticism for being in the domestic

intelligence gathering field.

Mr. Angleton. But I think the military took the posi-
tion that they were responsible for their own security in
conjunction with all other investigative agencies

In other words, there has always been a cardinal rule
in government that the head of every agency is responsible
for his own security, that when the FBI develops information
on any subversion, within any branch of the government, they
send copies of those reports to the heads of the agency
concerned for their action.

And, therefore, as.far as I know no one had turned over
the military prerogatives.

Mz, Johnson. Do jthese prerogatives extend beyond
the military base itself?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. I don't think it has
anything to do with what directly affects the security of
the armed forces.

Mr. Johnson. Was there an NSA point of view that emerses
TOP SECRET



in these meetings on the subject of intelligence, collection
procedures?

Mr. Angleton. The NSA position, I think, was simply
that they needed an espionage assist to further their own
activities, the results of their own activities, and that Mr.
Hoover, in changing his operational posture, was depriving

NSA of very highly sensitive collateral, which resulted in

one, non-production, or if there was production, tremendous
costs to arrive at the same intelligence break-through, and

unfortunately getting away from real. time collection.

Mr. Johnson. Are you talking about foreign intelligence?

ur. Angleton. Foreign intelligence, foreign and
domestic, but where it is interrelated, But the real time
factor was that with the Bureau's help they were able to
have real time in terms of their collection. -

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Johnson. We are talking about the point.of view of
the NSA. I am wondering next if the CIA brought to these
meetings any perspective on intelligence collection problems
and how to resolve the difficulties with gaps in intelligence?

Mr. Angleton. i don't think it brought it anything
that wasn't well known in the community.

Mr, Johnson. And that relates back again to Mr. Hoover
throwing up barriers on:certain procedures?

Mr. Angleton. That is right.

TOP SECRET



emune (Ares 202) $44-4000

I mean, there wasn't any secret in the community re-
garding’ the gradual cutting back of liaison, and cutting
back of operational support, and cutting back responsiveness
to requests, in other words, ever sector of the domestic
intelligence, which was a service of common concern which the

Bureau bestowed on the community.

And everyone could see, they were too experienced not to

see it all disintegrate, and more important, they knew about
it as it happened, because there is a great deal of communi-
cation within the intelligence community. And, therefore

if the head of NSA was-asking Mr. Hoover, and he had been
turned down on certain things, then that would be known to
many others who were expecting NSA to produce as many as they
had been producing a few months prior to that.

So as those things dried up, it just hit more and
more individuals in the community. It wasn't any theoretical,
it was all fairly hard core coverage.

Mr. Johnson. Rarlier you said that Mr. loover decided
not to allow certain operations because of lack of support
from the White House and the Attorney General?

Mr. Angleton. I said that is my understanding.

Mr. Johnson. Is it also true that Mr. Hoover, going
one step further, was concerned about the image of the Bureau,
and he was afraid that that image might be blackened by public

criticism of techniques that had been used once before.

TOP SECRET



20003

10 Furst Stree: S.€., wasninaton, 5.6

Mr. Angleton. I think so. I wotdd go a step further
and.state that the success and stature of the Burem depends
in large measure on the public support. And once the public
support starts Ciminishing, it has a direct impact on the
effectiveness of the Bureau, because they rely on much of the
citizenry of thig:countryto come forward as informants and
voluntary cooptees of the Bureau.

And once.conficence is lost in the Bureau, they lose
this public support. And I think Mr. Hoover was very
conscious, and probably more so than many people in the
government, was very conscious and sensitive to the degree of.
public support, or the lack thereof.

And I don't think he was going to stand idly by and have
the Bureay made a scapegoat when the Executive wouldnot
stand forward.

Mr. Johnson. Before turning to the actual special’
report itself, I wonder if you can tell me something about
the drafting of the special report, and also the degree of
consensus among participants as to the product that emerged
from those meetings.

Mr. Angleton. To my knowledge it was no real dispute

in the product. Oh,my own party,used Ober as my research

associate. In other words, when I needed information re-
garding the strength of the operation and activities, ard

so on, his job was ts produce the study.

Much of this was well known to the community, as I say,
prior to the meeting, I mean with the gaps.

So, I don't recall offhand -- this is nothing that stand
forward as in any disagreement -- there may have been some,
oh, verbiage, but I can't recall it.

Mr. Johnson. Was the actual drafting or the report done
by the Bureau?

Mr. Angleton. I think they took all the proposals and
came forward at each meeting with the drafting.

Now, whether we cooperated with them in that I don't

know. But I know that, as I recall, they would submit drafts)

that tried to reflect the consensus of the prior meeting.

Mr. Johnson. Let me at this point introduce into the
record Exhibit A-1, Mr. Angleton, a special report inter-
agency Committee on Intelligence, ad hoc, June 1970.

Mr. Johnson, Now, this is the 43-page specials report
that eventually went to Mr. Nixon. And essentially it had thre:
major sections.

The first section was a threat assessment. Do you
recall what the CIA contribution was to the writing of the
threat assessment, just in general terms?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Johnson. © Back on the record.

Mr. Angleton. From reading this, I would say that I

don't think there was any dissident on the fact as laid forth

here. We now know a great deal more about the Vinceremos

Brigate because we have had defectors from the Cuban DGI, and
their intelligence service. And we are quite accurate on the
uses of that for espionage, and so on.

And the projections there, I don't think we dispute
today.

Mr. JOhnson. ‘The second section of the special report
had to do with options for the President. There are parts
that are somewhat indistinct, but what I wanted to focus
your attention on was the actual options presented to the
president under six different collection titles,the first
one being communications intelligence. And you can see
on gpage 25 there is a series of options provided for the

President with a little space whereby he could check off whic

one he approved.

Now, what I would like to know is; from your

perspective as a CIA representative, of what relevance were

these options to your organization? i

Mr, Angleton. | What is the intelligence directive No. b
I don't recall that.

Mr. Johnson. That just outlines for the NSA its mandate
in monitoring the communications facilities, international
communications facilities, used by American citizens, You
might want to briefly glance over this section which explains
it.

Communications intel)isence is an activ-
ity of the NSA, as I understand it. And from reading the text
it seems like NSA had primary interest here. But I wonder if
the CIA was also interested in relaxing restraints in this
area.

Mr. Angleton. Every participant is a consumer of NSA
Product. And therefore they all have a an equal interest,
they all had a departmental interest in enhancing the coverage
by NSA.

Mr. Johnson. And this would have included the DIA
as well?

Mr. Angleton. Absolutely, because that is all they
are, they are under -~ NSA is under the Secretary of Defense

Mr. Johnson. Then --

Mr. Angleton. 1 know they had a watch list.

Mr. Johnson, . Let me be more specific, then

Was not the CIA providing names of individuals of
interest to the CIA who had been placed on: the NSA watch list?

Mr. Angleton. Are we talking now about domestic
intelligence, or normally?

Mr. Johnson. Let's begin with normally.

Mr. Angleton. Normally all customers, to my aoureage|
would levy requirements on NSA.

Mr. Johnson. In the case of the CIA, what would be an
example of a name that might be sent to the NSA to be
placed on a watch list? You say a terrorist.

Would that be an example?

Mr. Angleton. A terrorist, an organization, intelligente
individuals, political individuals, travel control.

Mr. Johnson. Would any of these names include the
names of American citizens?

Mr. Angleton. As of that time I don't know. I would
assume that if they were American citizens coming within
our jurisdiction, traveling abroad, there was reasonable
grounds for believing that they either belonged to an or-

ganization, or have been in contact with foreign intelligence

or foreign officials, that these names would appear on the

TOP SECRET



at @

watch list.

Mr. Johnson. So before the Huston plan the CIA
was levying requirements on the NSA to include on the watch
list names of relevance to the CIA?

Mr, Angleton. That is right.

Mr. Johnson. Now, would one objective of the Huston
Plan from the CIA point of view have been to perhaps expand
the number of individuals being monitored that were of in-
terest to the CIA?

Mr. Angleton. I can't answer that, because at this mo-
ment I do not recollect the procedures or the
channels of command through which these watch lists were
built up. I can't recall whether it went through Staff D or
whether components in the Agency have independent liaisons
with NSA.

In other words, the overt side of the House weould ob-
viously have relations with NSA directly. ‘And the CIA
people who were observers with the USIB covering other sectors
of the Agency would obviously have liaison in substansive
matters, and then the clandestine side would hve relations.

Now, it is that channel command, the channel of liaison
that would normally have been through Staff D.

Mr. Johnson. Mr. Angleton, I am puzzled by these options
presented on page 25. Let me read the second one to you:

“present interpretation should be broadened to permit

a program for coverage by NSA of the ‘communications of U.S.
citizens using international facilities".

Mr. Anglevon, Yes.

Mr. Johnson. Wasn't that already being done before the
Huston Plan or before the special plan?

Mr. Angleton. I would have to see what this directive

No. 6 says, since it related to that.

Mr. Johnson. Do you have any knowledge that before June

of 1975 the NSA was in fact covering the communications of
u.S. citizens using international facilities?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know.

Mr. Johnson. You don't recall getting any product
from NSA?

Mr. Angleton. I didn't handle ~~ I had a unit that
worked on counter intelligence data that came from
communications intelligence. And there were s0 many prom
grams in the clandestine services on travel control -~
in other words, all through the Cuban period there were
literally thousands and thousands of pages of information
derived from all other sources.

During the Cuban phase there was all the travel controi
on all foreigners going to Cuba. And I assume that covered
U.S. citizens. What I am trying to say is that there are
so many components in the clandestine side of the business

that would be engaged in special operations which through

Staff/D they would levy requirements.
Mr, Johnson. But do you also see my point in I am

wondering why these options would be written for

the president's approval when in fact there is some indication

that these activities were already going?

Mr. Angleton. Because I think it relates to the
question of interpretation of the President's Directive No.
in other words, that NSA was obviously complying with some
portion of that intelligence directive which the group felt
should be changed. i

In other words, they were relying on that verbiage
to justify some fields of inquiry into which they weren't
going, because they didn't have the personnel. But if we

had the directive it would be very clear.

Jeet, Si€., Warmington, D.C. 20003

Mr. Johnson. Do you recall at the time any discussion about

the need to make this directive more explicit by having the

President --

Mr. Angleton. No. All I know is, there was a directive
that was inhibiting to NSA. What paragraph of it, what it
said I cannot recall. But it was something that they held up
as a restriction in their liberty of action.

Mr. Johnson. From reading the text here one gleans the
understanding that restriction had to do with coverage by NSA
of communications o- US citizens using international facilities
And obviously they wanted the directive to be relaxed and
broadened to allow that kind of coverage. And so the dilemma
I am having is why they wished to have the President expand
that ‘coverage when in fact the coverage was already there?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know whether it was present in the
sectors we are discussing. I mentioned to you the Cuban thing.
There could be dozens of projects which would not be known to
the Counterintelligence, which would be known to Staff D, in-

which there was direct NSA involvement in supplying coverage.

I mean, the ones I can think of were such things as Cuban,
were matters where there was an enhanced interest on some
matter, operational or otherwise. But’ NSa does have liaison
officers covering the needs of NSA and so on.

Mr. Johnson. The second collection method discussed in the ”

Special Report has to do with electronic surveillances and

penetrations. Of what relevance was this particular method
to the CIA? The second opening talks about intensification of
coverage of individuals and groups in the US who pose a major
threat. Now, based on your recollection of the Langley meetings|
to which organization did this operation refer? Who was going
to intensify the coverage?

Mr. Angleton. The coverage would have been FBI, I think.
In other words, they are the only ones that were conducting an
electronic surveillance. If you leave NSA out of the picture.

Mr. Johnson. Within the US?

Mr. Angleton. Yes, And I think our problem, or the
problem that communities always had, is the lack of ‘broad
coverage to begin with on foreign diplomatic establishments,

and individuals within those establishments. And I will give

examples, or at least I will give one example which I think

characterizes the hard core counterintelligence interests.
Soviet intelligence is probably most deadly when it recruit
a foreign diplomat from a friendly country, say, in Moscow, and
follows his career. Eventually he ends up in the US. ile has
all the colurition of a friendly country, and thereafter all
kinds of doors are open to him. And he is not under surveillan
Yet having diplomatic cover he can deal with legal KGb and the

GRU at social functions. And the classic case is the case of



Wennerstrom, The Swedish Air Attache, who had been recruited

by the Soviets in the middle forties. While he was in Moscow

the Soviets built him up as the source of the American military,

and under Soviet guidance he produced a great amount of infoma- ;

tion for our attache's, which looked as though he was risking
his own life on their behalf to acquire information, it being
unknown that he was being manipulated all the time by the

Soviets.

So many yeara passed. Andveventually he was assigned to
Washington. And the American military, because of his favors
that he had done to American military in Moscow, opened up a1}
the gates to him regarding US installations, and teated him
almost like one of their own.

now, nis control was in the Soviet Embassy.. And he would
take microfilm rolled up in the palm of his hand, and as he
ghook hands he would make his delivery. And he had dead drops
and so on.

Now, taking that one case, and basing it on all of the modus
operandi which has come out of the knowledge of the KGB, we
vould believe that there should be a listing of all diplomats
who have served in Moscow, because the realcenter for compromise

and recruitment is there, by the Secretary Chief Directorate.

eet, Sof, Waymingion, ©.C. 20003

And they eventually turn it over to the First Chief Directorate,
which is the CIA side of it, when a man leaves Russia. So the

list for anyone who had served behind the iron curtain as

distinct from any of the other embassies, then if you didn't
have constant electronic coverage at least you would have
periodic coverage to take the pulse of that individual, what
is he doing.

Now, one of the cases the Bureau had involved an individual
from a friendly foreign country, and they found him in touch
with one of the Bloc countries, and a lot of other activities.
This was given to the intelligence -- or the security service
of his native country. Eventually they broke him as a Bloc
intelligence agent. Now, that came from electronic coverage.

So my point is simply that the status of status for counter~
intelligence purposes is totallly inadequate, based on the
information which we had relating to modus operandi.

Mr. Johnson. So this has been strictly an FBI activity?

Mr. Angleton. Yes, but working together with the other
investigative agencies, because the Pentagon has all of the
liaison sections, and they have hundreds of officers who wander
in the diplomatic milieu, it is a question of tightening up
the controls where there is memorandum of record, and of meet-
ings, and social events, and so, where they are dealing with
Bloc people these should be deposited with the FAI in order that

they have a data base against their electronic coverage.

TOP SECRET



prone (Aves 202) 544-6000

in other words, itis absolutely unbelievable that with all the
conterintelligence data and defectors that we do not have the
manpower and the lists to perform this relatively easy type

of coverage. In fact, in my view it is almost irresponsible.

Mr, Johnson. When it comes to this kind of coverage, does
not the CIA also involve itself in planning and lending to the
Bureau the use of sophisticated gadgetry?

Mr. Angleton. We have loaned atuff, I don't know how much, |
to the Bureau. But again I have had something to do with the
policy there. My attitude over many years ~~ and I was on the
Technical Production Board was that anything the Agency
developed by way of a sophisticated piece of equipment, that
prior to its use by us, where it could be compromised abroad,
that it be offered -- an offer and refusal business would be
given to the Bureau to see whether it could be used domestically
before its classification of secrecy became exposed, on the
gournds hat the priority for the Agency is the espionage
situation in the US. And therefore if we developed a piece of
equipment, they should be brought in and they should be exposed
to the equipment to see whether they can apply to a domestic
case. And then if they refuse it we submit it at much lower
security abroad, where essentially, when it is compromised it
cmpromises the use of that equipment against all Bloc services.
In other words, we had a piece of equipment compromised in

hexico, And the equipment was being used in other places

abroad. So you have to immediately know that that service woul

have immeidately take counter action in all‘installations aroun

the world, but it would also tell the other Bloc services. And |
i

therefore your dilemma is, you had given it to the Bureau with- |
{

out telling them of its compromise. And therefore on the

technical side you have to have the closest exchange. And by the
same token, if they have a breakthrough, and equipment no longer
has the same sensitivity to them, then we should get it for :
the purpose of either improving it or utilizing it.

Mc. Johnson. Would the CIA also have a rule inviting
personnel to administer this equipment in this country vis-a-vis
dipolomatic establishments?

Mr. Angleton. Not to my knowledge. I can see the Bureau,
say, a very hard case going to any government agency, or even
to the private sector, to bring in people who are superior to
their own, who complement or supplement their own. in other
words, I think when you have any operation, and you find a
fault in it, 6f a lack of expertise, you go where you can find
it, without regard to charters or all that stuff.

Mc. Johnson. _If you will look at the two operations on
electronic surveillances and penetrations, there is quite a
difference between the second operation and the third operation.
The third one has to do with diplomatic establishment, but the

second one has to do with coverage of individual groups who

pose a major threat. Did the CIA have an interest in using

this particular collection method within the US against certain
groups taht might pose a threat to internal security?

Mr. Angleton. I don't think that -- I don't remember
explicitly, but I don't think that it was our desire that
we would take on this activity if we could get the produce Econ |
the Bureau. Our interest would be to see what breaks out of that
inorder that we could take the foreign element, if the individual
traveled abroad, and there was a foreign angle to it, then we
would take over that aspect of it. And furthermore, in our
findings abroad we would have, those meetings with the Bureau
that we didn't refine in the requirements and we could target

more accurately individuals. When once you get latched on

someone that is domestic, and you make the foreign connection,

you are in. And you have got the Bureau controlling some

double on their side, and we are controlling some abroad, then
you can expand that thing into the entire network all the way
back.

Mr. Johnson. Did you personally feel at the time that there
needed to be some expansion of FBI activities in that area?

Mr. Angleton. In the area of what?

Mr. Johnson. In the area of electronic surveillances and
penetration between individuals posing a threat to internal
security?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think that wherever there is 8 threat

to the internal security, I think the Bureau should be on top

Mr. Johnson. What I am getting at is, I am wondering that
if in June of 1970. you felt that Bureau coverage in this area,
using this technique, was inadequate when it came to radicals
within the US?

Mr. Angleton. I don't think the Bureau or anyone else had

professional coverage to the degree that it was needed. And
‘this means not to be opposed to these people, because I think
that. what has to be spelled out here, our motive was never to
curtail the legitimate part of this student unreast or whatnot, |
our real problem was that since we weren't covering the
foreigners and the diplomats, and we didn't know from morning
to night what they were doing, that we didn't have a credible
or professional data base on foreign activities. And the
easieat.place to start on from is in our own country, The
efficiency of the CIA's counterintelligence depends in large
measure on the Bureau's, because anyone with a foreign
connection is going to broaden our jurisdiction. Every
diplomat or espionage operator in this country operates from the
headquarters within our jurisdiction. And therefore we have a
very highly vested interest that the coverage and the quality
of the coverage in the US be brought up. And we didn't think
much of the Bureau coverage, because we knew the limitations
that existed, as did most everyone in the community.

Mr. Johnson. Looking at these first two collection methods

that we have discussed so far, one on communications intelli-
gence, and the second one on electronic surveillance and
penetrations, would it be fair to say that the CIA already had
some names on the NSA watch list of interest to the CIA, and the
CIA was already receiving some product from the Bureau gained |

through electronic surveillance and penetration, but in both

|

i
areas there was a great deal of inadequacy, and 60 what the CIA

was really interested in here was a better product in both
areas, which really meant an expansion of the use of this
technique?

Mr. Angleton. There is no art in this technique. The
problem of the technique is ~~ let me rephrase that. Mr. lloover
obviously conceived the Bureau as a group of mean primarily
concerned with law enforcement. And in terms of his budget
career, esprit de corps, he didn't want to water his organization
with a tremendous number of clerical officers who from the
beginning to the end with only in electronic surveillance,
because my understanding of the electronic surveillance is
fundamentally that the message is in a strange language, and
collected by the thousands, and had to be processed by linguists
and I don't think he wanted to clutter his table of organization
with this. He was prepared todo it as it came up in the course
of their normal operational activity if they came across a
lead or an agent, then it might stimulate temporarily coverage

of that target.



h

What we wanted was ‘saturation on the foreign people, and
on the Soviets. In other words, we had a case in which a young
Soviet in the United Nations went outside of the restricted
area and threatened or brought a threat to one of our agents
who was hidden.

We asked the Bureau, where was he that weekend.

And they said they last saw him that Friday night in New
York.in his house.

Something was inadequate in terms of manpowers of not
knowing that on Saturday and Sunday he had gone to the Midwest
on operational assignement. And that is what I am trying to say.

I could take trht case and multiply it a hundred times.
And my view is that since the opposition works in a way that
both the KGB and carat principals, I mean they run the
embassies, that there should be coverage on all of them. But
the Bureau can only take a limited amount of personnel and then
allocate it. And therefore if you are going to have any
assurances of evaluating the situation, and so on, then you
have got to have the coverage. And the coverage, the easiest,
cheapest coverage there is electronic surveillance.
Principally when it is secure. If everybody knows the phone
is being tapped,’ then you learn nothing. And I dare say after
all these hearings are over that there won't be much counter-
intelligence derived if any.

Mr. Johnson. foesn't the embassy officials from Bloc

countsies simply assume that their phones are being tapped?

Mr. Angleton. There are emergencies that arise in which the
phone is the only way you can handle the emergency. or there
can be pay telephones, and they are unaware that you have the
ability to tap a pay telephone. In other words, there ia a lot
of art within this thing where the whole thrustvof everything -you
do is to get the enemy to underestimate you, so there modus
operandi is geared to really a false estimate of your capability.
And they don't use the phone, but they go to a pay telephone,
and there are only five pay telephones within walking distance.
And this particular day the 5th is the one they are going to
use. And surveillance can state which code that they are going
into number one. And thereafter the calls is picked up. If
he doesn't know that you have that capability he is going to
start running his agents out of those five telephone booths.

I am only giving that example.

Mr. Johnson. I would imagine if we were monitoring pay
telephone booths we would pick up a lot of other calls besides
calls made by embassy personnel?

Mr. Angleton. ‘Those are all pinpointed types of things.

It is known there has had to be communication between the

agent and the principal. If you have a source that you can
possible compromise, it tells you that there is going to be
a meeting, and therefore a call and arrangement made, a code

word said. And since they have gauged the fact that you don't

don't have that kind of thing, that means that for one call
based on inside information, you pick up the business.

Mr. Johnson. I would imagine that vigorous effort by the
pureau in this effort would have saved the CIA a tremendous
number of man hours.

Mr. Angleton. It would save everybody in the community.
Because you have to keep in mind also that the targets of the
Soviet espionage and fe espionage relates also to the State
Department, Atomic Energy, the entire military, and it goes all:
the way down the line. Those agencies have standard security
officers. And they have to rely on the Bureau for the domestic
coverage. And my point is this, that when you see cases of
espionage which have occurred, and you go back track on them,
you will find that had there been full time surveillance, and
a lot of manpower devoted, that those would have been nipped in
the bud, and you could have taken a straight agent and double
him back into the opposition. But in a case such as ii Dun.
case, the Sergeant who allegedly committed suicide in'sa, his
activity with the Soviets was only after his suicide.

Mr. Johnson. How was that?

Mr. Angleton. It was known, it became known. In fact, if
I am not mistaken, I think some of my communications to NSA,
very sensitive, were found in a plastic bag in his attic, as
I recall.

Mr. Johnson, You say alleged suicide. Do you have reason

to believe that it wasn't actually a suicide?

TOP SECRET

Mr. Angleton. Well, one accepts he is a suicide. But my
point ia that I do not know that we have such depth of knowledge
regarding his case that we know all the facts. And I would say.
the President's Foreign Intelligence Board made the most
exhaustive inquiry into the case, probably more than anyone
else in Government. And I have never seen their findings.

Mr. Johnson. The thirs set of operations discussed in
Special Report had to do with the subject of mail coverage.

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Johnson. Of what importance were those operations
the Central Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Angleton. Now, would you tell me your question again?

Mx. Johnson, What significance were those operations for
our organization in June of 1970?

Mr. Angleton. I think everybody there, with the exception
of the Bureau, was unaware that we had mail coverage.

Mr. Johnson. If you had mail coverage why was the President
asked to remove restrictions on mail coverage?

Mr. Angleton. I think the basic thing would have been --

I mean, he would know that this was a cover thing against the
other members of the community. In other words, if this had not
been brought out from Downie and all those observers, and so on.

Mr. Johnson. I suppose I am still unclear about this. Did
the President at this time know that the CIA had a covert mail

coverage program?

TOP SECRET



Mr. Angleton. My recollection is that we had certain

information from mail coverage which must have come to his
attention.

Mr. Johnson. If you will look at this page you will see
that it-states “covert coverage has been discontinued." Was
that in fact true?

mr. Angleton. I think thie is probably, ~~ that paragraph,
I think, was a Bureau comment.

Mr. Johnson. Do you find this rather misleading, to send
a report to the President that tells him the covert coverage
has been discontinued, and then asks him ~~

Mc. Angleton. I am not so sure -- I don't know the origins
of that paragraph. In other words, it refers here to
Congressional hearings. I don't recall ~~ T know ‘they were
happening, but I don't recall which ones they were referring
to here. We had a former Deputy Director, Scientific and

Beg vite
technology, Sfolville, who had belonged to the group of
scientists who wrote some very pointed inquiries to the Post
office -- and I don't remember the date -- regarding the whole
mail coverage business. To my recollection, Colville, while
with the Agency, knew of the program. Now, what this is
referring to I don't know.

Mr. Johnson. Did the Bureau have a program at this time?

mr. Angleton. 1 don't know. They may have had one that

was discontinued. The operative part of that as I see it is

Mr. Angleton. I don't think it has anything to do with the!

shether those are Congressional hearings involving accusations
of Government invasion of privacy.
Mr. Johnson. So you think the sentence applies to the FBI

program, not to the CIA program?

CIA. I don't “remember any of us ever making any representations
to those representatives of USIB regarding the existence of the
program,

Mr. Johnson. Including the White House Representative,
Mr. Huston?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I don't think we bring him into it.
That was the kind of thing that if anything was going to be

said, it would be said to the Attorney General and the
President, becuase the Bureau naturally knew about the program
for a long time. And they knew that we had a common code name.
And therefore they would be just as conscious of the fact that
this was somehow known to the two of us, so there wouldn't be
any purpose in a roomful of people of exposing the mail
coverage to those people that had to go back and report to
principals, particularly when you have the kind of statements
that Downie and others made about the fact that they could not
vouch for any security in their own organizations.

Mr. Johnson. But isn't there a problem here that a report

was prepared for the President which had some misleading

statements in it?

Mr. Angleton. No, because I think they would have all been
clarified fact to face with the President. And they may well
have been. In other words, what I am trying to say is, it is :
quite conceivable -- and it really never occurred to me -- that |
it is quite conceivable that given the closeness between Huston
and Bill Sullivan, that well before this meeting Bill could havd
gone into the whole status of the Huston project.

Mr. Johnson. Huston claims now not to have known about the
undercover program, and he feels somewhat duped by the intelli-
gence community. And of course, the more important question is,
was the President duped into believing that this was such a
program, and being asked a few pages later to allow the Agency
to institute it?

Mr. Angleton. I don't think other than’ your thought that
the President wasn't going to be notified.

Mr. Johnson, Notfied about a new program?

Mr. Angleton. No, notified about why we had to put this
thing in there. My God, you couldn't be there- asking for
electronic surveillance and all those other forms of coverage
with a group of counterintelligence people who raised the
question of mail coverage.

Mr. Johnson. But isn't it possible that President Nixon
read this on its face value and did not know about the mail
program, and thought that he was being asked --

Mr. Angleton. I don't think that he ever read the thing.

Mr. Johnson, But to return to the question, isn't that a
possibility that the President read this report to him at its
face value and thought that he was being asked to institute a
mail coverage program in which he was already doing --

Mr. Angleton, I can't answer that. I know that any byplay
of what happened to that report until the blowup, in which Mr.

Mitchell begged Mr. Hoover in terms of destroying this project

Mr. Johnson, This section of the report states that routina
coverage is legal, while covert coverage is not.

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Johnson. And you said that the CIA had a covert mail
program underway?

Mr. Angleton, Yes.

Mr. Johnson. So the obviousl conclusion was that the CIA

was conducting an illegal activity, is that the correct

conclusion to draw?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. That was drawn up for the
audience which was there. The audience which was there was

Mr. Angleton. I mean, the people who were there were
representatives who were pretty low on the totem pole. I mean,
outside of Huston and Sullivan, all ot those were relatively
junior officials of the organization.

Mr. Johnson. Well, you were not a general officer?

Mr. Angleton. I mean junior in terms of the entire Agency, —
yes. Normally there have been Tom Karamessines, the Deputy
Director, or somebody.

Mr. Johnson. But on June 5th in a most serious fasion, the/
President asked the intelligence community principals for a
complete report on intelligence gaps and how these gaps could be
closed? :

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Johnson. A very serious meeting, and, as you mentioned
at the beginning of this proceeding, a rather extraordinary
meeting.

Mr. Angleton. That is right.

Mr. Johnson. And yet it seems to me that the produce that
was prepared for the President was not compared in the same
kind of serious vein in which all of the fact were laid out in
a very valid fashion for the President's position.

Mr. Angleton. I think that the paper responded that --

to Huston, and that he turned the thing around by making a very |

articulate denunciation of the priorities, and of stating that

the papers produced did not respond to the President's request. :

So he was very clear-cut on this.

Mr. Johnson. Even after that upgrading by the 29-year old
Huston, did the group drafting this rpport eventually respond to
the President's request, that is, for a thorough complete
report?

Mr. Angleton. As far as Huston was concerned, yes.

Mr. Johnson. But of course Huston -~

Mr. Angleton. I was the judge of those things, because no
one who was present had talked to whoever he was reporting to.
He was the only one that would take ‘the thing into the White
House and emerge fromthe White House. He was speaking with the
authority of the White House.

Mr. Johnson. Yes, but he was a young man with not much
experience in the intelligence community, and certainly no
basis to judge whether this was actually a complete and factual
report for the President. In fact it wasn't a very complete
and factual report in some part, because the President wasn't
even told about a mail coverage program.

Mr. Angleton. I didn't say he wasn't told.

Mr. Johnson. In the Special Report, I mean.

Mr. Johnson. Within the Defense Department?

Mr. Angleton. That is right, within DIA.

Mr. Johnson. Was this viewpoint shared by you and the CIA?

Mr. Angleton. We have no point ot make on his organization,

no way of judging it.

Mr. Johnson. I mean for your own organization?

Mr. Angleton. We took him at face value for what he had
to say.

Mr. Johnson, But were you interested in diluting the
report for fear that it might fall into the wrong hands within
your own Agency? You were manipulating and diluting it because
of Downie's, concern about DOD?

Mr. Angleton. Because this was a roster that people were
present. Is that it there?

Mr. Johnson. No, it is back here.

Mr. Angleton. You don't have to go over that roster to see
that you couldn't do a lot of things. There were a lot of other
things you couldn't open up. Their report was not in otherwise
supervised lateral arrangements. What business we were conduct~

ing with the Bureau, we didn't table with those people. The

things that we are doing with NSA we didn't table with these
people, because they were already on-going operations or on-gol
liaisons. So there was no reason to table it to them.

Mr. Johnson. Was this a charage in essence, then?

Mr. Angleton. No, it wasn't a charade. It was the fact
that this was one area where, the same as you would enhance an
electronic, you would enhance all forms of communication, all
channels of communication.

Mr. Johnson. But you harken back to the June Sth meeting in
which the President was deeply concerned about the domestic
intelligence, because he says it to the intelligence community
leaders, please bring me a complete report on intelligence gaps,
and we want to close those gaps. Please do that report back
and have it back on my desk in three weeks on June 26th. And
yet when the report comes back one could argue that it is not
the kind of complete report that the President ae uesteds

Mr. Angleton. All I am saying is that it met Huston's
need, and from what I read in the papers, his correspondence
with Haldérman and Erlichman, he expresses surprise at the
cooperation received. And he was totally satisfied. And on
the basis of that he submitted his famous letter of 8 July that
he was assuming that role as the agent for or the White House
representative on domestic intelligence. So he was obviously

totally satisfied. And he wasn't as naive as you indicate,

because for the years prior to that, or for a year or so prior

problems, a again is reflected in his White House interoffice

memorandums with Halderman and company.

(Off the record discussion.)
Mr. Angleton. As I recollect, the letters when they were
printed in the newspapers referred to the fight with Hoover,

Billy Sullivan's own situation. Ahd:that was all in the papers.’

So my point there was that he was much more sophisticated than |

one would think.

And second, he was speaking to a group who respected the
fact that he was the White House representative. And you have
to keep in mind, this was a unique situation, because to my
knowledge it is. the first time in history of American counter-
intelligence that a person at that high level ever attended a
substantive meeting. Never in history has there ever been
that type of thing, even though many times in the last 20 or
30 years the Bureau and the CI people, counterintelligence, in
the Agency, had always wished to have a meeting between the
Director of CIA and the Director of FRI with the President to
resolve the question of cooperation between the two agencies.

Mr. Johnson. So were you pleased to see this kind of high
level policy access with the counterintelligence people?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I don't know whether I was pleased or
not. That never crossed my mind.

Mr. Johnson. You had never had that kind of access to the

White louse before as counterintelligence people. Weren't

you hopeful?

Mr. Angleton. I am not pleased by those kinds of things.
It was a development that didn't astonish me, because I was
quite aware, in and beyond all the Sullivan and Huston business,
of what the real state of affairs were. And I know the
problems that Admiral Gayler was having, and knew the issues ini
counterintelligence organizations regarding the threat

Mr. Johnson. With this new White House interest in the
problem, weren't you hopeful that the thing would change, that
the CIA individuals would have their day in court in the White
House and be able to point out their position?

Mr. Angleton. I certainly hope that the liaison with the
FBI would be reestablished, because all that was something in
which myself and my deputies had been involved in since 1954,
and even before, and to have that cut off was -- just simply,
it was like losing~your moorings, you just simply drifted.

Mr. Johnson. Let's return to this discussion we were
having before about the meaning of the options... here on mail
coverage. Is what you are telling me that this document was not
really meant to represent the entire truth about collection
procedure, because that would have revealed too mamy sensitive
matters to a rather large audience?

Mr. Angleton. We were not going to reveal outside the
Bureau the mail coverage operation.

Pentagon position, which with the DIA and Secretary of State,
means a tremendous channel of staffing, which he himself
outlined to us.

Mr. Johnson. Of course one interpretation that is made by
some people in examining this document, is that:it was. an :
effort by the CIA to conceal from the President one of their
on-going collection procedures?

Mr. Angleton. That is not so. Because I can't recall
whether it was before or after that we saw the Attorney General,
who we regarded to be the President's Chief Executive Officer.
And where he was shown the actual messages of intercept. He
saw the mail coverage on things which were of deep concern.

And so there wasn't any -- the last thing in the world was to
withhold from the President anything.

Mr. Johnson. Now, if you are talking about the meeting that
is discussed in the Rockefeller Report, that occurred a year
after this?

Mr. Angleton. I can't recall those things, because we
were working on many levels here, we were working on a level
like this, which occurred -- how many meetings, I don't
remember?

Mr. Johnson, Four meetings.

purely a side line affair. And I would have thought that the
meeting with the Attorney General was at a different time. 1
always thought this was a meeting coincident with this, because |
I remember -- the reason. I feel that there was some communica- |
tion with the Attorney General was the shock I felt when I was
told that the Attorney General stated he was aware of the

Huston business, and it didn't make sense -~

Mr. Johnson. You know, on this same page, in a footnote
that was apparently added at the request of Mr. Hoover, the
Director of the FBI felt compelled to point out to the
President in no uncertain terms that he was not going to support
a covert mail coverage program.

Mr. Angleton. Well, I can't speak for what was on Mr.
Hoover's mind. But the Bureau, and I think the Secret Service
even, were levying requests and getting all the take, all of
the production out of it. Now, I refuse to believe that given
the quality of the information, that it wasn't that Mr.
Hoover did not know what was going on.

Mr. Johnson. My point was, though, that the Director of
the FBI felt compelled to speak very frankly to this issue,
apparently, in a footnote. But Mr. lielms did not speak with
total frankness about his own program in this report.

Mr. Angleton. But I don't know ~~ the thing aborted. No
one expected this thing to die as it died.

Mr. Angleton. No, it is not another issue. Because my
view is that Hoover -- I mean that the Bureau and ourselves
would have disclosed the mail program to the White House,
because we would have no customers.

Mr. Johnson, Would have disclosed the mail coverage?

Mr. Angleton. Of course, Because if you had a man in

Huston's position, domestically having the same authority, as
hea put it, ad Dr. Kissinger had for Foreign Affairs, then he
would be entitled to all sources of information. That is what
I am trying to say. And therefore he would be a:point..of the
closest tie-in with the Administration, with the Executive,

to work out priorities.

Mr. Johnson. So the CIA and the FBI were going to hold off
on informing the President on this program?

Mr. Angleton. No, I didn't say that. I said that if the
program had gone ahead, if there hadn't been this unexpected
reaction, then -- because you see, no one -- I would never have
dreamed that the White House staff could have launched such a
thing without the Attorney General being fully apprised, because
everyone was rightly or wrongly conscious of the fact that the
most powerful individual, in terms of the White House, was the
Attorney General. And therefore it was inconceivable that in
his role you could have the FBI chairing from Justice a meeting
of this sort without his being sully appraised at the White

House level of what was going on. To me it still is something

I refuse to believe. Because I only heard by hearsay of how
his reaction was to the Huston thing, and how he had killed it,
and how he went to the President. It was all hearsay.

But it is inconceivable --

Mr. Johnson. I want to return to that point in a moment.
To finish up this section on mail coverage, I wonder if we
could finally reach some conclusion on why it was that mail
coverage, covert mail coverage, was called illegal in this
report, and yet the CIA had a program going at the time, and
the Bureau had one going before. Why is it that the Agencies
were involved in illegal programa?

Mr. Angleton. That is the whole history of the mail
program.

Mr. Johnson. I don't ask you to do that, because I think
Mr. Wallach is going into that.

Mr. Angleton. I say, I would have to go into the whole
history of the mail program.

What I am really ttying to raise is a philosophical question
here. When does an agency feel compelled to conduct an
intelligence collection procedure which is widely considered to
be illegal? What kind of decisions are made to go ahead on a
program like that, despite its illegality?

Mr. Angleton. Well, it went on since -- what was it, 1952?
And I think it was going on three years before we became
involved in it. So it was an on-going operation. And I don't

think that the files properly reflect that there was a much
stronger counter intelligence interest than the record shows.
And Eric trim, who was prominent in the origination of it wien |
the Office of Security, by background an FBI man in counter-
intelligence. ‘And in OSS he was X-2, counterintelligence.

And I know him intimately. And his whole thrust of any kind of |
espionage or other operational usage would have a very strong
counterintelligence base to it.

Mr. Johnson. But you see the thrust of my question. Here
was set before the President some options which presumably
he could improve by making a change in the little blank to
the options. . and {f.-he had approved those options
he would have been approving in essence the kind of lawlessness
in the intelligence program, he would have been approving a
program that right in the report itself was referred to as
illegal

Mr. Angleton. I understand that.

Mr. Johnson. So could one make the argument that the
intelligence community was asking the President to approve

Mr. Angleton. Not the intelligence community. The
intelligence community was not told of the program. The people
who appeared were not told.

Mr. Johnson, Okay, let me refine that by saying the leading

representative of the Bureau and the CIA?

Mr. Angleton. I don't understand you at all.

Mc. Johnson. Let me start over on this point, because in
fact it was the intelligence community,-wasn't it, because this |
document is signed by Gayler and Helms.

Mr. Angleton. But they didn't know to my knowledge anything
about the mail program,

Mr. Johnson. But my point is that they were setting down
on paper some options *r'3 for the President to check off which,
had he done so, in case of two and three, would have meant that |
he would have approved an illegal program. So can't we say‘ that
the four principals of the intelligence community si med a
document that laid before the President a set of 6ptions
that were illegal?

Mr. Angleton. Let me see that again.

This isn't it. This is electronic.

It says here: “High level postal authorities have in the
past provided complete cooperation and maintained full security
of this program." ‘that is, covert coverage. Ic explains that
there is covert coverage in existence.

Mr. Johnson. Where does it explain that?

Mr. Angleton. “High level covert coverage. High level
postal authorities have, in the past, provided complete
cooperation and have maintained full security of this program.”

Mr. Johnson. But isn't this the key phrase, “in the past"?

Mr. Angleton. We will come back.

"This technique involved negligible risk of compromise.

which is the present tense -- "and personnel involved ‘are highly

hard core and authentic intelligence which is not obtainable
from any other source. An example, is a case involving an

operative part in this xeroxing. :

You had better read this, because I haven't read it.

Mr. Johnson. I think it is really the key phrase where it
talks about covert coverage not being legal.

Mr. Angleton. In your research on this have you come across
any draft papers on these different things?

Mc. Johnson. No. ©

Mr. Angleton. Because I mean, I can't reconstruct who wrote
this, who supplied the verbage. In other words, I don't know

time?

Mr. Angleton. It may have been only because of Admiral
Gayler's abortive attempts to change Mr. Hoover's mind on
relinquishing this type of operation. But in actual fact we
had as much interest as did the Bureau in the surrepticious
entry. .

Mr. Johnson. Could you briefly explain why?

Mr. Angleton. Because of the product. In other words,
it is not solely an NSA product. The NSA would want the
cryptographic assist. But on the other hand it could be bag
and pouch reports that went through the air, and expense books,
and identities of agents, and all kinds of documentation, In
other words, it is probably the highest level of collection,
both for espionage and counterintelligence purposes, that exists.

Mr. Johnson. Is this kind of operation carried out by

Bureau in this country?

ir. Angleton. I don't know. I don't know what they had

done.

Mr. Johnson. In the past, was this strictly a Bureau
activity?

Mr. Angleton. I think that they should be asked. What I
am trying to say is that to my knowledge -- I may be wrong ~~
J don't think that they ever officially told us of their
activities, although I think it was well known -- I mean, it
was known to selected people.

Mr. Johnson. Does the CIA use the technique of UU
entry within the US?

Mr. Angleton. I have read the story, I think I have read
in the press something about some disagreement with Mr. lloover
over some operation in Chevy Chase or something, I don't know.

Mr. Johnson. According to the set of options on «
surrepticious entry -- we are talking about mcre than diplomatic
embassies, we are also talking about the use of this technique
against other urgent and high priority internal security
targets. To your knowledge has the CIA ever used surrepticious
entry against non-diplomatic establishments within the US?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know, I am not an expert on that
I read that some of the security cases involved it, there are
some personnel. And Mr. Colby has given a very lengthy numeri-
gal thing as to how many times that is used or not used,

Mr, Johnson. Why is it that the CIA and the NSA have relied

to conduct surrepticious entry in most cases when

it comes to foreign embassies within this country? Why don't
they conduct their own activities?

Mr. Angleton. Basically it is because to be successful
requires an enormous amount of manpower and expertise. In
other words, the process of surrepticious entry first requires
sources. It requires idantifying the time of the entry. It
requires total hermatical sealing off of any people from that
embassy from returning unexpectedly, which means that all
parties that might return are kept under total surveillance,
go that in the event that they decided they have left something
back at the office, the team is warned. And it would be
almost impossible for anyone to try to do it successfully
except the FBI. They are the only ones with the assets and the
coverage.

Mr. Johnson. At the bottom of the page of the Special
Report, in this section on surrepticious entry, the FBI added a
note. The naote is indistinct on the page or copy I gave you.
But it is reproduced ‘here. Do you find that a credible reason
for eliminating this collection technique is the reason that the
number of police guarding the embassy adds to the operational
hazards? Or do you think that was a smoke screen put up by
Mr. loover because he simply didn't want to use that procedure?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know what he means by the increase
in the number of police.

Mr. Johnson. He is referring to that executive protection

force that came into existence in late’1970.%7

Mr. Angleton. I really don't have any comment to. make on
that. I don't think that the Bureau would have told -- they
would have told the Attorney General and the President of the
state of the art, but I don't think that Mr. Hoover would feel
obligated to expose to the other principals an activity of this
sort in which the Bureau is the primary beneficiary. In other
words, as the chief law enforcement officer charged with the
domestic counterespionage, he would not to my way of thinking
share the information until its use had been exhausted for
internal security purposes. And this was an audience to which
I don't think he was prepared to spell anything out. Normally
he would handle that by seeing the Attorney General and the
President.

Mr. Johnson. He wouldn't have even shared his views with
Mr. Helms?

Mr. Angleton, He was under no obligation to charter-wise
or any other way. (

Mr. Johnson. The next set of options has to do with
development of campus sources. And the list of options are

here. And here is one specifically mentioning the CIA.

Mr. Angleton. I think this is mainly FBI language,
that is, up until paragraph 5, up to that point it is involv-
ing the problems of the Army and the Bureau running into the
ROTC problems. And then I guess down to 5 -- of
course, we have had experience for many, many years with the
international concerns, and the troubles that the Ft. Myer
outfit had in the Katzenbach report, we knew from hard core
activity that the Youth Festival in Vienna, and that the
Soviets -- I mean, the Soviets ran the International Student
Business and front organizations. ~

Mr. Johnson. Mr. Angleton, would this first option
have been of interest to the CIA -- I am sorry, not the first
option, but rather the second option? i

Mr. Angleton. I would put it this way, that I think
it would have permitted the PBI to have gained much more
intelligence. And as it opened up, to travel abroad for
international conferences, it would give us the opportunity
for recruitment, and opportunity to take those people over as
agents.

Mr. Johnson. But would you have wanted to develop
your own campus sources?

Mr. Angleton. No, we would rely on the Bureau ~~ we
may have selected once where, for example, it was a period
for this when in Mexico City Soviet intelligence was cultivat-

ing Americans at the University of Mexico for espionage

purposes.
Now, when we get a case of this sort, then we would be
zeroed in on the hard core Soviet case. So, we were working
from a broad back into the country. ‘This would give us the
strength of working from here outward.
Mr. Johnson. In order to protect your own CIA re~
eruiters who were visiting campuses, did you ever think it

would be useful to have your own CIA sources who might tell

you what the student body was doing?

Mr. Angleton. Personally, outside of the domestic
contacts people, I would say at that time we did not have
personnel or manpower.

Mr. Johnson. The next and last set of options has to
do with the use of military undercover agents.

Would that have been of significance to the CIA directly?
Mr. Angleton. It is the same way as the previous

options, that the Agency would benefit from any hard core

intelligence developed by the Army. And you have to keep

in mind that over the years we had broken the-Army cases of

espionage abroad, in which the agents concerned came back

to the U.S., and so on. ‘They would pass the military

counter intelligence to the FBI. In other words, we worked

with them abroad, and then when it reverted to the U.S. we

worked with the FBI.

So any knowledge that they could acquire extending

this into the Armed Forces on campus, and so on, it is
bound to have -- eventually these people would be assigned
abroad.

Mr. Johnson. Would you have supported at that time an
expanded counter intelligence role for the military within
the U.S.?

Mr. Angleton. No. We have always had first rate
liaison with the military counter intelligence services.

We have trained the original OSI people in the counter ~~

by "we", I mean my people trained them. And that.was a
cadre of people who in turn went out and trained others,
we have refresher courses.

Mr. Johnson. What I am really getting at is this
second option in which it saya, the counter intelligence mix
of the military services should be expanded to include the
active collection of intelligence concerning student-
related dissident activities.

Would you have supported that?

Mr. Angleton, No. That is a matter between the
Bureau and the military. We would get a by-product in a rare
instance, I would assume. But that appears to me to be
primarily a matter between.the military and the Bureau.
Because I think the military were charging the Bureau with

all kinds of investigative leads and things of this sort.

I don't think the Bureau had the manpower to comply.

Mr, Johngon. According to the testimony of other wit~
nesses, there were two other options that were discussed
in some detail at these meetings, but not included in the
special report.

One of these was surreptitious optical surveillance.
Now, the questions that I would pose to you on this is, number
one, what does it mean?

And number:.two,how did it relate to the interests of the

Now, I am just wondering if you thought it did.

Mr. Angleton. Well, again, my understanding of the
term, it is simply the accumulation of newsreels, the dissi-
dent acts, and violence, and what not, when you acquire
enough to identify the ringleaders, you can identify those
people who appear in all the different front organizations
who are the stimulant in this.

So, it narrows down your investigative target.

Mr. Johnson. Was that -- is that being done already?

Mr. Angleton. I think that -- my understanding at
that time was that it may have been done -- I don’t know
this from direct knowledge. I think that Downie did talk
to that subject.

Mr. Johnson. But you don't recall these specifics?

Mr. Angleton. Yes, I can remember. I think that is

Downie who mentioned something about the photographing of

TOP SECRET



prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

people who attended rallies and so on, where you can identify
that this one person, this group of people who you see
visually, who are actually doing the egging on here turning tha
car over, who are doing that, and then pretty soon you will
find that they are in Washington, and they are in college

and then some other place. ‘Therefore, as in all that type

of Fifth Column work, once you get the hard core of your

real targets, then you can anticipate where the next action

is going to be.

There were publications then or later when they had the
Washington thing, I mean the big hassle here in Washington
where the people that were putting on the show worked up
militant plans of every conceivable type on how to handle the
police and communications and all of that

The query was whether they dreamed that up themselves
or whether they had technical assistance from professionals

Now, I was not directly involved in that, but I did
hear comment to the effect that it was too professional to
just come out of the woodwork, that it had to be that somebody

with a professional background to devise the strike action.

1 wish I could remember some of the verbiage that was in the

cover of this.
Mr. Johnson. I know what you mean. I have read that.
Do you have any recollection why this option was re-

moved from the special report?

Mr. Angleton. No. I would say maybe the only reason
it ws removed was simply that it was not regarded to eases
that it was a matter“of minor importance. in terme of. the other
matters.
Mr. Johnson. ‘The last option that presumably was of
some importance in the discussions had to do with the investi-|
gation of diplomatic personnel. |

Now, I understand that before the FBI will conduct

an investigation of diplomatic personnel in this country

it will get a clearance from the State Department.

I further understand that some of the members of the
Bureau wanted to eliminate this clearance procedure, and so
that was brought in discussion.

Do you remember anything about this?

Mr. Angleton. The problem has been a problem that
goes far beyond this interagency business. The problem is
that it was our understanding, rightly or wrongly,
that this was a self-imposed restriction of the Bureau's.

In other words, the Bureau was under no compulsion by law or
procedures to clear these things with STate Department, that
they did it by way of protection, if anything went. wrong,
then they could fall back on the State Department's agree~
ment.

Our objection was, number one, that we believed it to

be a needless disclosure of counter intelligence data, and

‘TOP SECRET:
because in order to make your case with State, you had to put
into their poasession the most sensitive information. And
from our point of view this was again gratuitous.

And second, we didn't agree with their policies of
leniency regarding the activities of the Soviet bloc per-
sonnel in this country.

Now, this was brought out in a very lengthy annual
report by the President's Foreign Intelligence Board, in
which they went down into all the problems and restraints as
they dealt with the diplomatic community here ~~ the
lack of reposit. And the thrust of their findings was that
the State Department was leaning over backwards in order not -
not facing up to the Soviet bloc presence.

That-was submitted, I believe, to McGeorge Bundy by
the President's Foreign Intelligence Board. And answers
were sent back from State to the Bureau and ourselves.

The result of it was, nothing was done, and State argued
and justified their position, but no higher authority arbi-
trated it or moved in and made decisions.

I think that is what it relates to.

Mr. Johnson. But in the context of these others ~

Mr. Angleton. It was an on-going argument, and
probably the reason it wasn't raised is because it was so
complex in terms -- I mean, the problem was known already, was

known.to the Attorney General, it was known to the President's

TOP SECRET



Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

..Foreign Intelligence Board, et cetera. And I think

probably again it was considered to be minor in comt::
parison with the other.

Mr. Johnson. ‘I have pnt others down here.

Do you remember any other options that were discussed
and not included in the special report?

Mr. Angleton. I know there were many others,but I
don't remember any of them that stand out, You can't get
a gathering of these people together.wWe knew very little
about the original meeting, what transpired at the original
meeting with the President -- and got a great number of
proposals that were very far from target.

Mr. Johnson. Do you find it ironic at all that the
President was mainly interested in domestic unrest and ob-
taining better intelligence data about radicals in this
country, yet the meeting itself seemed to dwell at great
length on foreign intelligence data?

Mr. Angleton. No, IT think his interest was equal on
both, and I think he saw the problem very clearly in terms
of both the intelligence abroad and at home. I think this
is borne out by the fact that at some period of time my
understanding is he met with Mr. Hoover at Camp David and
expressed to him his dissatisfaction with the Foreign Intelli-
gence coverage, and instructed him to increase his legal

attache representation abroad, which in fact was done again

the protest of the State Department or Ambassidors in the fiel.

Mr. Johnson. And also CIA protests?

Mr.Angleton. We were encouraged to join them, but
we did not, because we had different points of view. In our
view any American presence abroad, increased American
presence abroad, working counter intelligence, is an
advantage, as long as we get the product. And as long as
they coordinate, and Mr. Sullivan's attitude -- and he knew
that we disagreed was that it was hampering the Bureau
by taking away personnel. He felt his people could be
better ‘employed at home than abroad,.because he was hurting
for personnel.

I think personally -- I disagreed with him -- and he
knows this very well -- it was because we didn't have
strong enough personnel abroad. And then, the FBI, by
virtue of the prestige of Mr. Hoover, and the kind of men
they have, inspired a lot more confidence in many instances
with foreign police, who really did have a very high regard
for Mr. Hoover. And, therefore, his representatives were
accorded a kind of professional treatment that wasn't
necessarily accorded to us, And they would visit the u.s.
and they would meet Mr.Hoover, and he in a sense was the
leader in the non-Communist world of law enforcement

offices. And, therefore, it accrued to our advantage when

the Bureau operated abroad, as long as we got the oroduct,

TOP SECRET



pmone (Ares 202) 544-6000

and as long under the charters, aa long as they coordinated

in advance in the business. But there was also a tremendous
amount of law enforcement business criminal in nature, which
sometimes goes into the field of subversion, which only the
Bureau can properly handle.

Again, because of their personnel -- they had lawyers,
law enforcement, they know the chain of evidence, and how it
has to be preserved, and basically because of Mr. Hoover.

Mr. Johnson, The third section of the special
report had to do with the recommendations, and the primary
recommendation was for a permanent interagency committee on
intelligence.

How did the CIA feel about this concept?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think that we were in agreement
that if the President -- I mean, I don't know, I don't know
what our position was at the meeting, but I know -- I think
it might have been -- and that is that if the President had
set in motion Mr.Huston for a purpose, therefore, the
implementation had to be controlled by somebody with the
authority, And Mr. Huston was putting himself forward as
that authority. There wasn't anyone to dispute his position.

Mr. Johnson. What I really want you to address your-
self to is the concept of coordinating intelligence evalua-
tion and dissemination within the intelligence community by

some kind of interagency body.

stom

Is that a good concept?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know if this is an accurate
statement of that, is it?

(Referring to document.)

Mr. Johnson. Let me show you the text itself in the
special report. Here are the options.

Mr. Angleton. Let me see how this gets introduced,

I think it is self-explanatory. The attitude, as I

remember, of the Agency was that the whole exercise wouldn't

have been done unless the President had in mind evaluations of!

finished intelligence. And there wasn't any such body in
the government,

Mr. Johnson. WAs there a hesitancy on behalf of the
CIA to get involved in domestic intelligence which was primar-
ily topreserve the FBI.

Mr. Angleton. After all, we are in a number of inter-
agency meetings, that is, as observers or members, where the
Bureau is the Chairman and so on.

Mr. Johnson. Probably as blatantly oriented as
this one would have been --

Mr. Angleton. I mean, the whole exercise was
blatently domestically oriented, and everything stated there
is true,that there wasn't any point whether this could be
done, and if the Bureau didn't agree on a point, they each

went their separate ways.

TOP SECRET



Prone (Ares 202) 344-6000

There was no one in authority to try to evaluate it and
put it before the President as a decision.

Mr. Johnson. Apparently Mr. Hoover viewed it as an
encroachment upon FBI turf. I wonder if the CIA viewed
it that way, too, and were a little bit hesitant?

Mr. Angleton. No, the CIA's attitude very definitely |

Ahir
was that Mr. Huston wasn't their except as the President's

representative, and if this was what the whole exercise was i
i
about you couldn't do all these things unless it was Policed.
And since it was the President's desire from calling the’
principals together to get this thing embarked on,. and at :
the end you have to see how it was going to be policed, who |
did you turn to? i
So, as I say, there were different attitudes

in the community on domestic problems, and to articulate what

in fact existed, you had to have somebody, or you had to have

some chairman in close contact with the White House who could |

submerge agency and departmental differences into common
priorities, common objectives, and so on. And no one knew
how dt was going to be. At least it was one of the options.
Mr. Johnson. Do you recall any other recommendations
that were made that were later withdrawn from the special
report?
Mr. Angleton. No. -

Mr. Johnson. Do you recall anything about how these

footnotes were included into the special report?

Mr. Angleton. You mean Mr. Hoover's?

Mr. Johnson. Yes.

Do you know the story behind the footnotes?

Mr. Angleton. No. All I know is that I heard that
the report had gone up to him, and he had taken an adverse
position on every recommendation, that he had seen the
Attorney General, and the Attorney General, who had been
unaware of all of this, took a very strong stand against
Huston, and either saw the President or something and got it
killed.

Mr. Johnson. Did you know who were involved in the
discussions that led to this special report, did they ever
really think that it was going to get by Mr. Hoover?

Mr. Angleton. I don't think anyone ever came to a
consideration of it.

Mr. Johnson. Wasn't it widely known --

Mr. Angleton. Personally, as I said earlier, I had
believed that there wouldn't have been any such meeting had
it not been worked out in advance between the Attorney
General and the President. That is the reason I still
refuse to believe that the Attorney General was unaware of
the exercise.

Mr. Johnson. Were you surprised that the Attorney

General was not invited to participate in any of these

proceedings.
Mr. Angleton. I thought he was behind the whole thing.
And it stood to reason, he was regarded as the most powerful

person under the President, and witha lot of special assign-
y
ments.

You would hear that such and such a thing,he was the
one who was the President's advisor, or making the recommenda-

tions. So when this thing came up, I thought that this was

the Attorney General, and the President had had many
meetings -- they had a meeting of the minds, and Huston was
chosen with the Attorney General's blessing. :

When I found out later that he didn't even know, then
knew that there wasn't going to be any --

Mr. Johnson. Didn't anyone ever ask at the Langley
meeting what the Attorney General's views had been on some
of these items?

Mr. Angleton. There wasn't any reason to raise it.

I wasn't going to disclose to people I didn't even know what
I happened to know about domestic problems, the Bureau and
the Atiorney General. That wasn't the kind of forum for

\
that.

Mr. Jchnson. So no one at these meetings say, look,
some of the things we are talking about here are illegal, and

before we put them in an option paper to the President shouldn't

we have consultation with the Attorney General's office?

TOP SECRET



Sc£., wasningins, ©.C, 20003

Mr. Angleton. There may have been somebody that
said :that, but it doesn't stick in my mind. In fact, the
@iscussion of those meetings was so fluid and so many times
off the target, that it was only when the Bureau brought back
the finished draft of the previous meeting that it gave any
cohesiveness to what really took place the day before, in
other words, the fact that pill Sullivan had a recorder present,
one of his men who took the notes and papers and all that.

Now, whether he had an ad hoc drafting committee Iam
not certain, but I think he might have had,in which Ober was

a party to it.

So, the coherency of the meeting became apparent the next
meeting when thé paper was circulated. And I think if you

-wanted some insight into many questions you would ask, it

would be to find the different drafts so you can compare

wnat happened in the opehinymeeting with what emerged out of
the last meeting. And I am certain those were in being
someplace.

we had.

this document was signed by the four principals?

think that they ran it around by courier, I think this
was a lot of pressure by Huston or somebody to get it
signed, and I think there was also a question that all the
principals were in town or something of that sort.

I don't remember ever seeing it.

Mr. Johnson. Do you remember when Mr. Helms
told you that the President had approved it? :

Mr. Angleton. Let me just go through it, because it
might come back.

Let me ask you, before I reply to your question, some-
thing on dates. This was dated the 23rd of July. When
was Mr. Hoover's turndown? When did Mr. Hoover take all the
exceptions?

Mr. Johnson. Ne put his footnotes on the document
around the 24th, 25th of June. And then the Special Report
went to the White House on the 26th of June. As far as I
can ascertain, the next response to the intelligence
community was this document saying --

Mr. Angleton. A month later?

Mr, Johnson. Yes.

Mr. Angleton. I find that very hard to believe.

Mr. Johnson. what was your reaction to that parti-
cular memo, the one you have just mentioned?

Mr. Angleton, My reaction was that he was working
closely with the President and the Attorney General. It is
inconceivable to me from anything that we knew and heard that
the Attorney General was not the moving hand in the entire
business.

Mr. Johnson. Did you think it was a good idea that theré
was a domestic equivalent of Henry Kissinger to deal with
domestic intelligence problems?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think that there should always
be somebody who enjoys the trust of the President who ia

accessible for high level counter intelligence, interagency

disputes ~- I mean, whether there is an independent co-equality,
there should be an arbitor, someone to whom the agencies
in question have access. I am strongly in favor of an
ombudsman of some sort on the National Security Council, which
is not controlled by people involved in the foreign affairs,
distinct from it.

And I think the internal security is a legitimate eonceea
of the President, and requires full time or part time,
a full time or part time expert who has access.

Mr. Johnson. Do you recall being happy or pleased
that the President had approved relaxation of collection res-

traints?

Mr. Johnson. This simply indicates that Mr. Helms
was returning to the situation room the previous document
which I just showed you. And the reason I show this to
you is, I am trying to recall to your mind any recollection
about the recall of the Huston decision memorandum.

We have a lapse of five days here.

Do you remember any reaction of the CIA, the 23rd to the,

mr. Angleton. But what day of the week was it?”

Mr. Johnson. It was over a weekend.

Mr. Angleton. You would have to know where the
Director was --

Mr. Johnson. My point was simply, were you advised
that the President's order was recalled almost as quickly
as it was issued?

Mr. Angleton. Not when I -heard that Hoover went to
Mitchell, and that Mitchell was unaware of the exercise
Then the whole house of cards became apparent. That was the
first indication we had of what the details, power politics
were.

Mr. Johnson. Let me introduce into the record Exhibit
A-4, Mr. Angleton, a memorandum for the record written by
Richard Helms dated 28 July 1970.

Mr.Johnson. This, of course, refers to the meeting
that you have alluded to earlier in which Mr, Helms found out
that Mr. Mitchel did not know about the special report or the
Huston Plan. I wonder if you could interpret this phrase
for me in paragraph 2.

Mr. Helms says:

"I told the Attorney General that we had put our
backs into this exercise”.

Now, presumably he is talking about the preparation
of the Special Report.

Mr, Angleton. That is right.

Mr. Johnson. And does that indicate to you that the
Central Intelligence Agency was enthusiastic and strongly
supportive of the options developed in the Special Report?

Mr. Angleton. It is not a question of whether they
were in support of all of the actions there, but were
supportive of the fact that the President, in accordance
with what Huston had to say, did not feel he was getting
a picture on the domestic activities, because we didn't
feel we were getting it.

1 mean,there was no question about that, but that goes
in and beyond the Huston things or anything else, the atmos~
phere in the community was the lowest possible thing in terms
of domestic counter intelligence, or foreign, evolving

around this split and the lack of liaison.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Johnson. The final area that I wanted to talk

to you about is the aftermath of the Huston Plan. And when on

speaks of the aftermath I think one thinks of the Inter-

Prone (Ares 2021 $44-6000

agency Evaluation Committee, and also subsequent efforts
to relax intelligence collection restraints.
Let's turn first to the Interagency «Evaluation

Committee. You were a member of that committee, were you

not?
Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Johnson. Could you describe briefly the origins

and purpose of this committee?
Mr, Angleton. I don't remember the -- when was the
meeting, can you tell me?

Mr. Johnson. December 3.

Angleton. The same year?

Mr. Johnson. Yes.

Mr. Angleton. I don't remember how this thing
originated. I think the question of gaps which preceded
Huston Plan was still active on another level, in other
there were many levels of express concern. It was the
normal level of the lack of FBI liaison, and another level
with the Huston Plan, and then there was something that
generated or brought back to life this whole question of

domestic intelligence. And I am not certain unless you have

documents on how I was notified to be nominated for that

TOP SECRET



business.
That is my first statement. It is possible that Ober kndws

or has .the papers, because I know that when it eventually

mone (Ares 202) 544-6000

came to having working bodies, Ober was the natural choice
for taking that on.

The first meeting, as I recollect, was in Dean's office.
And I think that is when they had -- that is my recollection.
And that is when Mardian appeared. And whether: it .was in
that meeting or in a series of meetings, he proposed setting

up a -- and again this is all as though we were: working for

the President in this thing, meetings were held there, and
one meeting was held in the Vice President's conference room,

and here was the counsel to the President doing the laying

off of hands, And they had some judge from Seattle in mind,

o
5

whom they eventually brought to a meeting who was to be
the head of this evaluation business. And there was a

lot of discussion on the cover he would have, and where he
would be located.

And it boiled down to the fact that he was totally
out of his depth, he could not foresee his being able to do
it the way it was proposed on the grounds that he had too
many friends from the State of Washington who had come to
Washington, and he had -- and there were questions of

prestige involved, and a question of what was he doing in

410 First Street, 5.€.. Wasminaten, 0.€. 20003

Washington, and so on.

TOP SECRET



So,I think that was the last appearance he made.

But nothing seemed to be generative regarding these meet
ings until Mardian «began holding them in the Triangle
Building. And his whole thrust there was that he wanted
permanent representatives from each of the agencies to be
there full time under him in some kind of a staff setup to
work on domestic -- on the evaluation of domestic affairs.

And this is when the thing began to become concrete,
until he ran into problems with Mr. Hoover, and the Bureau
took a very strong position that they would not supply a

secretary, And as I recall, I was opposed to supplying

personnel, and then there were a lot of things that we were
not privy to behind-the-scene things.

And finally, George Moore, I believe, was the --

3
°
:

I can't recall whether he was the one nominated.

In our case I reported to Dick, and I believe Tom
Karamessines, and the result was that we decided on Ober.
But with an understanding that it could not be full time, and |
a private understanding with him that he could handle it
any way he liked.

"tn other words, we didn’t want him te go into a make-

work situation.

Mr. Johnson. What was the Committee doing, conduct-
ing any operations?

Mr. Angleton. I think it was pulling together all

information on given situations. I can't even tell you the
subject matter right now. But I think dissident newspaper
things, I really don't know, I would have to see the

papers, because they were about as incohesive -- I think they
were the most: inconclusive meetings I have ever seen in my
life. And so the buck was passed to Ober, really. He had to
arrange some way to go down there~- and I don't know how many
times he went. And any papers, I don't think were very
informative, I don't think they ever came to any kind of
conclusion. The people that had the best information to my
recollection was the Bureau.

Now, whether this got into the Berrigan case -- the
reason I mention that is that while all of this was going
on, Mardian was running the phone all the time, and giving
us -- telling us aside something about the Berrigan business.
And that is aboutthe extent of my immediate knowledge of that.

Mr.Johnson. Did Mardian have a good grasp for
intelligence problems?

Mr. Angleton. No, not at all. I think he was
really out of his depth. But he had connections. He obviously
had a very powerful position, I mean in terms of being able
to get what he wanted.

Mr. Johnson. Did John Dean play an important role
in the history of the IDC?

Mr, Angleton. Well, he loaned his office and himself

to the launching of it.
Mr. Johnson, Did he stay with it?
Mr. Angleton. No. He gradually withdrew, but the
whole -- those meetings which gave it a certain prestige:
and all the rest of it were those at which he was present.
And then he gradually got out of it.
Mr. Johnson. Why did you stop attending these meetings?
Mr. Angleton. I had too much to do -~ it was par-
tially that, but also -- with my responsibilities I can't go
to meetings. And usually I would send people to meetings.
Mr. Johnson. Let me introduce the final exhibit
to the testimony today, which is Exhibit A-5, memorandum
for the files, John Edgar Hoover, dated April 12, 1971. i

Mr. Angleton. What about this?

Mr. Johnson. pid Mr. Helms ever discuss with you this
meeting that Mr. Hoover and Mr. MItchell and Admiral Gaylor
attended?

Mr.: Angleton. rt am trying to cast back and latch onto;
somebody in '71 to get a feeling.

I am certain he did.

Mr. Johnson. More importantly, do you have any
recollection of a report being prepared for Mr. Mitchell as
a result of this meeting, a combined CIA-NSA report, as Was
requested?

Mr. Angleton. I think -- what I am trying to remem=
ber here is whether this had to do with an operation that the
Bureau was conducting in this country anmiwhich they were
going to close down, and which we were trying to save, and
we were trying to save it in part because of the Director's
responsibilities to the intelligence community.

In other words, Dick was not necessarily speaking
here as the head of CIA, he was speaking for the USIB.

Now, I may be off on a different phase of life, but T
think this is related, and this entailed our moving ‘our
man intoreplace Bureau men, and putting up money, and I
think we used the Office of Security, if I recall correctly,
if this is what was the outcome of all of this.

Mr. Johnson. Do you remember the Helms-Gaylor report
written for Mr. Mitchell?
Mr. Angleton. But that is something that would normally

be taken up with Staff/D, the people who are in liaison with

NSA, or that could have been directly from Dick or his Deputy. /

Mr. Johnson. Do you remember Mr. Helms coming to you
and saying something to the effect, Admiral Gaylor is after
me once again to try and get Mr. Hoover --

Mr. Angleton. This was going on all the time. there
were probably hundreds of calls in reference to the problem
about the NSA thing. I know that I strongly backed the
idea of keeping the operation from dying.

Mr. Johnson. Which operation?

Mr. Angleton. The operation dealt with clandestine
procurement.

Mr. Johnson. Did that operation relate to any of the
collection methods we have discussed today?

Mr. Angleton. I think so.

Mr. Angleton. That da,"4f what I.am discussing have

‘uny reference to this. But this was a thing that Gaylor

wanted’ to save, and I was called by people in NSA to give
support to, and so on. That type of intervention.

Mr. Johnson. Could you shed light on this sentence:

"phere was his discussion upon the part of Mr. Helms
of further coverage of mail".

Mr.Angleton. No, unless it is dealing with black
bag job eeeeacisaa I think that means diplomatic mail in

bags, pouches.

TOP SECRET



Johnson. I thought black bag referred to surrepticious
entry.

Mr. Angleton. No, black bag could be also steling a

enone (Ares 202) $44-6000

courier's bag. And you have a diplomatic courier, and he has
got the code and the mail for an embassy. The plane doesn't
leave New York, it is 30 below zero. And hewants to get warm: |
He leaves hia pouch there for a minute, or half an hour.
the Bureau picka it up and photographs the contents. So the
black bag -- what I amtrying to say is, Mr. Hoover could not
use the same art forms that we would use. And I just am trying:
to think -- he didn't say how long this thing went on.

Mr, Johnson. Would this sentence imply that Mr. Helms is

encoyraging Mr. Hoover to reinstate a mail cover program?

\Mr. Angleton. No. I read it -- my own view is that it

3
‘
°
i

would be more than mail. It would be black bag job operations

Now, those black bags would refer to the surrepticious entrance

into an embassy, the penetration of a diplomatic pouch in
transit, and part of that of course, is mail. And the most
secret of all mail is unciphered mail, in other words, it is
mail that does not go out over the air waves, but where all
the cryptonyms or identities only go by armed couriers with
the identities. And then the correspondence goes through the
air with those identities. And it makes no sense to an
interceptor unless he has got the key. So I can't imagine Mr.

Helms referring to coverage of mail except in terms of the

proceedings in those black bags.

Mr. Johnson. Why couldn't he be talking about a mail
intercept program?

Mr. Angleton. I don't think he was referring to it.

Mr. Johnson. It notes there that Mr. Helms was going to
respond rapidly, take care of the report rapidly. But you
don't recall any response? ~.. ta

‘os. In other words, it looks as though we were
trying to work toward a resolution of the same issues as
developed in the Huston Plan, and Mr. Mitchell is going to make |
a decision --

Mr. Angleton. But those things were all going on -- what
I am trying to explain is that people are reading a lot into
the Huston Plan, and at the same time are unaware that on
several levels in a community identical bilateral discussions

were going on. In other words, the Huston Plan didn't affect

| one way or the other the normal flow of business. And when

| Gaylor was faced with Hoover's shutting off and cutting out

certain things -- there were time factors involved, the lease

i of a piece of property, the personnel who would take over, the

|| point being that if you didn't meet those deadlines that was

the end of it. And therefore those were sort of frantic things.
And I imagine that the reason that Helms said it would be taken

care of very promptly was that he probably already had staff

myself. But the principal person would have posi ststte, and
probably a Deputy Director that he might have cetiad fa gee
legman on it, and he might have told me sdmething about the
Gaylor -- what had happened. But I don't remember his discus-
sing that with me precisely in the meeting with Mitchell and

Gaylor. There was no reason why he should have -~ with Hoover.

Mr. Johnson. Were you aware of the series of meetings that |
|

were very much like this one?

Mr. Angleton. Not of a series of meetings with Mr. Hoover

Mr. Johnson. But a series of discuasions going on at
different levels?

Mr. Angleton. Oh, yes.

Mr. Johnson. Are you aware of any other specific meetings
on this topic between Mr. Helms and Mr. Hoover?

Mr. Angleton. .No. I think that Mr. Papich, who has the
best memorandum of record of anyone in Government, will surprise
you by showing you how few times any Director of Central
Intelligence ever met with Mr. Hoover. Practically never,
except when it was a National Security Council meeting or
something by accident.

Mr. Johnson. Why is it that Mr. Hoover would send a formal
liaison over to the other Agency? Why didn't it work the other

way? Why couldn't the CIA say, we are going to send over Mr.

go and so to be liaison from the CIA to the FBI?

SECRET



Mr. Angleton. That was his own way of operating. In
other words, Mr. Hoover believed that his statutory responsi-

bilities were not negotiable. And he would not permit eny

Prone {Ares 202) 544-6000

inter-xgency committee to challenge or water down what he had

by right. And therefore he never attended usual meetings, and

he sent observers or someone, they may have been members in
the end, but they were originally observers, and so on. And

personally I feel that that was the proper way of operating,

because of tha compartmentation.necdssary: for the activities of!
the FBI, and the internal security.

And he didn't want people who are here today and gone
tomorrow wandering around in the FBI. And it was very tidy
housekeeping on his part.

Mr. Johnson. Let me end by just touching on one other

3
:
<

topic. Couldn't one argue that if we could do away with a
number of laws that restrain intelligence collection, that the

quality of intelligence would increase dramatically? Aren't

there certain barriers that keep the intelligence specialists
from getting high quality product that they need?

Mr. Angleton. My own feeling is this. This country can
never work against the police state, or contain the activities
of a police state, until there is a lot of relaxation in the

law as far as counterintelligence and internal secuirty people

e1, S.€., Washington, O.C, 20003

are concerned. To begin with, in an open society you don't

have the laws for protection of secrets. You don't have an

TOP SECRET



official secrets act. You would not have penalties for

disclosure, except the passage of unauthorized personnel to a

foreign power. Now, President Truman made the comment tha it

Prone (Area 202) 544-6000

doesn't make any difference whether it is spies or newspapers
who publish the secrets as far as the US Government is concerned.
Washington himself was the greatest believer in intelligence.
And he wrote about it. And he spelled out very clearly that
intelligence was worth nothing unless it was secret. And he
tried to kidnap twice Aaron Burr, once or twice. Benjamin

Franklin opened the mail of the British. He was fired as

Postmaster for doing it. In other words, there is a whole US
tradition that believed in standing up to build up the national

security. It has been wreaked these last years.

Mr. Johnson. Don't we have a real tension here? Isn't

3
;

there a danger of transgressing against the civil liberties

of the American citizens when we relax those laws?

Mr. Angleton. I am not proposing solutions. I am saying
that first the law makers and the press -- let's leave the
press out ~- the law makers and the Administration, the
Executive, have to know the danger of a threat. And I think
they have to examine the laws in terms of those which are
unrealistic in view of the threat. Now, that has never been
done. And again, I come back to my original suggestion that
there should be an ombudsman, a person who does have that

access to the Executive, who is not shackled by inter-agency,

TOP SECRET

internecine fights and all of that, and who is in a position
Powerful enought to take what he does know, that is communicated
to him, and be able with the President work out legislation
to meet the threat. And also counterintelligence should have
a very direct bearing on the objectives of the Executive, I mea
the realities. And if you do have, as I mentioned, the

Rumanian intelligence working with the Soviets, then obviously
|
you can't treat the Rumanians-as something apart from and special

in terms of the threat, because if they are arrested on Oslo
working against NATO and against the West, and their activities
are -- I mean their questionaires benefit the Soviet Union
strategically, then you can't make that differentiation. So
you are not arguing philosophy here, you are arguing factual
matters that derived from counterintelligence operations.

Today there is total gap between the realities of counter-
intelligence and the knowledge of the public and the knowledge :
of the Congress. Otherwise you wouldn't find them all going to!
Russia on jaunts and all that type of thing, there would be an
entirely different point of view, In other words, today we

are equating ourselves with the Soviets on so many levels.

They are not equating themselves with us. What we regard today
as having some permanence to them is the tactical. Those are
not my words. Those are the words of the Soviet, and the

powers who are in the Sovit bloc in official capacities, and

you have access to: documents and to party directives. So the

point I am coming back to is that I believe -- I have not read
his entire speech, but the speech that Kelley gave from

Canada to the Lawyers Association, the Bar Association, was
something to the effect that there had to be in the interests
of internal or national security certain sacrifices of personal |
liberty. And I subscribe to it all the way. I am not talking !
now about criminal activity, I am not talking about marijuana
or otherwise. But where there is conspiracy, -- and thedr
country is incapable of getting below the iceberg. We know a
tremendous amount of illegals. And yet there has not been a
true high grade legal case since Abel. And Abel didn't talk.
And yet from what we have heard from people in the KGB the
identity of high grade illegals are only maintained by the
chief of the service and not known to the resident tourists.
And those are people who assume the identities of the Americans
and who work for the opposition, You have to have. a great deal
of latitude in order to uncover these types of people, and to
paneeeaee through the communications problem, how do they
communicate. They need money « There are many ways that they
can be discovered. But they can't be discovered the way we are
hampered today, and also where we are breaking down compart-
mentation. And I think the tragedy of all of these hearings
and everything that has transpired from the beginning has been

destruction of the secrets as to the collection and modus

operandi and techniques and the identity of individuals,

a complete housecleaning, no on is going to be left that knows

Mr. Johawm,. And what is the point to my question?

Mr. Angleton. I am saying that I think that if I am not

-- I think it is of unilateral declaration by the President?
But I may be mistaken.

Mr. Johnson. That was my understanding.

to it, did they?

Mr. Johnson. We both will have to have another look at it.

Mr. Angleton. I know in ita original context, I think it
had an element of being a unilaterial affair.

Mr. Johnson. But what if there is a bilateral or multi-
lateral treaty? Do their provisions also apply to the covert
arm of ‘the CIA?

Mr. Angleton. “y only am taking this one instance up. I
would say -- I don't know how to respond to that. It depends
on what the substance of it would be. If, for example, we find
the other party of the treaty ‘violating through their intelli-
gence service the treaty, then I think it is a question that
would have to be considered here, that we could not permit them
to outdistance us. But let me put it to you another way.
one Soviet -- we had a very high level source who attended a
general staff briefing of the Soviets, addressed by a three-
star general of the general staff. And the subject
was electronics. And this was in 1961. And the Soviet general
atated that the US was ahead 14 years, in the field of
electronics. But he said that they would overcome us through
three tactics. One would be through the increase of 2,000
staff officers added to their espionage side on the scientific
and technical to exploit the openings of the West of scientists
and others going to the Soviet Union, for espionage and

recruitment.

Bear in mind that espionage is the highest art form in the
Soviet Uhion. They came out of the cave by reason of what.
Soviet intelligence did in the atomic and other fields. And
here was a Central Committee directive of 1959 that 200
scientists would be added to the espionage corps: to exploit
opening to the West. That was number one. And number two, as a
weapon of overtaking us, would be disinformation, misleading |

us scientifically up blind alleys.
where we would expend both monies and assets and capability and‘
manpower on impossible objectives transmitting disinformation.
And number three, by tying us down with binding treaties
which would blunt our technilogical growth. Now, that was

the word. Before I left the Agency, perhaps a month before,
some American scientists and intelligence estimators, sat down
and made an estimate that the Soviets were four years behind
us in electronics. Now, you take the story of an agent who
was present in that high level top secret meeting, and here
are people who knownothing whatsoever about that meeting, who
independently have brought out a study to the effect that they
are four years behind us.

Now, my own view is that there will be a terrible reaction
in my lifetime against what is going on today. Because there
will be a period when there will be a shift in the balance

of power or there will be a confrontation with the Soviets

where this country will back down, it will be probably an

directed at this period of time, and there will be a very stron:

And I have no doubts as to that being the case, because the |
jong term Soviet objectives were directed and redirected in
‘59 to one thing, and one thing alone, the change of the balance
of military power. And I stand on that,

Mr. Johnson. Mr. Angleton, I would like to thank you very !
much for spending the afternoon with us today.

Mr. Angleton. It has been enjoyable,

Mr. Johnson. Do you wish to make a brief closing statement.

Mr. Angleton, I may some other time, but not today, 1
may really read the statement and see what I said.

Mr. Johnson. You are welcome to at any time.

Mr. Angleton. And I will direct it to the judge. Because
T am embarrassed about one thing, and that is the lack of paper
regarding the Intelligence Evaluation Committee, I:mean the
fact that there weren't files on it.

Mr. Johnson, You will be given an opportunity to inspect
the transcript of your testimony and to make minor corrections.

Thank you.

(Whereupon, at 5:28 p.m., the Committee adjourned, subject

to the call of the Chair.)
