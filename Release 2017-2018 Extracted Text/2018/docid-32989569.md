On arch 6, 1974, NK T-3 advised XOBExT DE PUCH, IvrormawT

National Coordinator, MINUTENEN Organization,[related informa~
tion that FRANK DRAGER had recently visited him.f DRAGER was
to stop in Columbus, Ohio, to see a JOHN/GERHARDT and proceed
to Reading, Pa., to visit ROY FRANKHOUSER. ORAGER was supposedly
carrying a message from DE PUGH to GERNARDT and FRANKHOUSER,
GERHARDT and his brother, ED} GERHARDT. are leaders of the Anf€fican
White Nationalist Party in Columbus, Ohio. The GERHARDIS and

. JAWES THOMPSON were arrested for shooting the homes of school

any right wing organization, He did admit to being the
organizer and leader of the White Action Hovement (WAH) which
operated at one time out of Trenton, New Jersey, and Reading,
Pennsylvania. Ue advised that the headquarters operations
of that organization were diskanded dus to a lack of finances,
Be declined to comment on the names of any members or of
the total number of individuals involved in the WAM. DRAGER
stated the aim of his movement was victory for ail right
wing organizations and this was to be accomplished through
political elections or other necessary methods. His methods
inclided preaching to the public concerning goals of his
organization and by supporting the right type of individuals
for public office. He considered BOB NII#S, who is presently
incarcerated in the Federal Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas,
to be the type of individual qualified to hold public office.

DRAGER stated that his WAM has adopted a philosophy
of being the coordinator between all right wing organizations
currently operating in this country. He stated that the
strategies and ideals of all right wing groups actually are
very Similar and that when the conditions are right there
will be a unification for alli these groups into one large
organization that will effectively be able to take control
of the country. He stated he originally founded the WAM in
1970 and for a time published and distributed literature in
an attempt to educate the public concerning his beliefs.

He advised that WAM was unable to mecomplish its goals as

an above ground organization and as a result several years

ago he decided to take the organization “under ground",

Although there is no longer any formal organization or
financial backing, WAM still has its officers and membership
but the extent of its activities consists of himself and

others traveling the country preaching the right wing philosopby
to any group that will listen. DRAGER declined to comment

on the number of individuals presently in WAM but did state

he had previously issued 300 membership cards. He again
declined comment concerning the names of any of the organiza-
tion's leadership or its membership. He did state that the
majority of WAM members were disillusioned members of other
right wing organizations. He advised the uniform of WAN
cousists of military fatigues with a pistol belt with a

half swastika emblem on the collar. This is the uniform he
usually wears during his speaking engagements.

DRAGER stated that recentiy he had been vacationing
in Florida, living mainly on previous savings. He did work
for approximately 17 days as a chef at the Ocean Reef Club,
Key largo, Florida. He was paid $250 per week there and had
accumulated about $500 at the time of his departure from the
Florida Keys area. He aiIso advised he was currently existing
on survival tablets, taking up to 12 tablets daily as a
method to supplement his normal meals, He stated he could
easily maintain his health and weight by use of these tablets.
DRAGER claimed that he is traveling by camper truck and that
Since leaving Florida he was en route to New Jersey when
arrested in Springfield, Illinois. He declined to comment
on when he left Florida or to where he had traveled since
that tim. He further declined comment concerning any meetings
he may have attended or any communication he has had with
any individuals connected with extremist organizations during
his travels, He advised that he usually camps nightly in
either State of Federal park campsites or if none are available
would utilize a commercial camp grounds.

DRAGER stated that the individual who was arrested
with him in Springfield and who has been traveling with hin
Since leaving Florida is CHARLES MIDDAUGH, who has been a
friend of the family for several years in New Jersey. He
was nost recently released in January, 1973, from a juvenile
detention facility in New Jexsey. He stated MIDDAUGH worked
with hin in Florida and that he is currently MIGDAUGH's legal
guandian and will be until his 19th birthday in December,
1974, He advised MIDDLUGH shares some of his same basic
beliefs but is not politically motivated in any way. 7

He admitted that DANIEL BRODERICK was the indivi-~
dual who was arrested with him by local authorities in New
Jersey in September, 1973, and that he traveled with him for
a pevied but that Bnadunick had stayed in Florida. We advised

NW 55130 DocId:32989569 Page 47 = ma

tome cern



SI 157-4275

”

that BRODERICK contacted his lawyer concerning the pending
charges in New Jersey and has probably returned to New Jersey.

DRAGER did admit to past memberships in the American
Nazi Party, National Sovialist White Peoples Party, Ku Klux
Klan, Knights of Constantine, as well as generally claiming
membership in all right wing organizations at one time or
another during the past 15 years,

He stated he was recently the self-appointed Acting
Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey. He felt the
organization needed leadership and that he had the respect
of other leaders in the group, but did have some conflicts
with some other independent klan organizations in New Jersey.

DRAGER stated that he, in the past, has been
harassed by local authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investi-~
gation but that he has never had any problems with any of the :
jdeadership of any right wing organization. |

He claimed he iS not currently a member of the
Minutemen organization but that he does personally know
ROBERT DEPUGH. He declined to comment on the last time he i
had any communications with DEPUGH.

VA. + DRAGER stated he personally'knows several individuals

~" "associated with the American Nazi Party, including MATT: KORHL
and DON/ PARSONS in Virginia, and first name unknown COLSMAN
in Chi¢ago. He advised that from 19¢1-1967 he was a member
of the/ American Nazi Party and worked in its national head-
quarters in Arlington, Virginia. He worked closely with
GHORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL during this period as his second in
comand although ke would never accept any rank higher than i
lieutenant. For a period during 1964-1967 he worked mainly i
at the party's training camp in Pennsylvania as the individual
in charge of the printing of all literature for the party.
After ROCKVELL's death, DRAGER advised he was asked to take
command of the party but he declined because of his past
criminal record, a>decision he regrets to this day. Approxi-
mitnly three months after ROCMIDLL's death he left the Nazi
Party. DRAGER feels that MATT KOEHL, the present commander
of the party, has the guts but not the know-how to run the
party organization. He does not feel that he has the charisma
that ROCKWELL has and he does not reach the public effectively
with the party's message. DRAGER stated he currently has no 7

NW 55130 DoclId:32989569 ‘Page 48



SE 157-4275

association with the Americnn Nazi Party or with the National
Socialist White Peopies Party. 7

DRAGER advised he knows no one in Illinois associated
| with the American Nazi Party of the National bocialist White

7 Peoples Party and the nam DAUDI wkEK moans little to bi:

| We does recall] DasYun writing to his wlll but stated DL
was not at Nazi Party Headquarters in Arlington during the
i Same period that he served there.

He advised that he knows no one in the Phoenix,
Arizona area since the death of WENTBROOK PAKO (phonetic).
He knows cf no right wing activity in that area but he did
recall in the past he communicated with a Nazi Farty member ~-
there but he no longer recalls this individual's nam.

DRAGER stated that all of his travels are basically
politically motivated and that the main philosophy of his
| WAM is victory for white Christianity and a return to the
natural order. He feels that the white race was placed on
this earth as the "gifted race" and that a geographical
separation of the races is necessary to prevent interbreeding
of the races. He contributes the basis of his beliefs to
the writings of HITLER but stated that many of the ancient
philosophers preached the same white supremacy philosophy.
He believes that interbreeding of the races will eventually
Jead to the degeneration of our society and its eventual
downfall,

DRAGER stated that in the event the political

j system fails as a means for the right wing groups in this

i country to save the country from its external and internal
enemies, then any other means necessary will be used to achieve
their goals, He feels that if the Government will not act

to save the country then right wing organizations must act toa
do so.

DRAGER stressed the danger of an internal enemy in
the form of an overly suppressive Government that would no
longer act for the well-being of the average white Arcrican,
Although he stated again that the right wing extremist
organizations will attempt to gain pover by legitimate political
process, if this process should break down any method, including
that of violence, would be used to accomplish their goals.
He stated thetargets of the right wing would be any suppressive

s

LNW-S53:30—Rocld:32989569 Page 49 -G-



I 157-4275

on

Government agencies or any left wing organization that would
be doing the "bidding". of the suppressive Governient in

power. Additional targets of the right wing would include
the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Kevenue
Service, and such organizations as the Jewish Anti-Defamation
league, who although is not a Government agency, he feels

it receives its authority to act from the Government.

DRAGER agreed that to succeed in the violent over=
throw of the country a supply of weapons and ammunition would
be necessary, He stated he knows of no right wing organiza-
tion who currently has a stockpile of weapons and advised
that the source of weapons at the right time would be the
United States military establishment, whose leaders and
white members he predicts will join his cause when it is
time for action, Although he has heard that the Minutemen
organization was stockpiling weapons, he has no evidence that
that organization currently has any large supply of weapons
in its possession.

He stated that he also felt that all the State
units of Government will join his cause at the right time
and that they will revolt against the suppression placed on
them by the Federal Government. ‘He feels that even personnel
cf the Federal Bureau of Investigation will join his cause
because of their basic conservative beliefs and because of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation's concern for the good
of the country. He feels that the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation is now only a "pawn" of the Justice Department from
which it receives its orders.

DRAGER continued tosstate his personal philosophy
concerning the power and influence exerted by the Jewish
population in this country. He considers the total Jewish
control on tke f£merican political system to be the greatest
internal threat present tceday in our system. He believes
that the Communist movement, all racial organizations, and
all liberal left wing organizations operating in this
country are toois of the dewish population in the United
States. He predicts a complete economic takeover by the
Jewish seguent of our society. £8 exaimies of the extent
of the Jowish control in this country, DLAGER uses the
appointment of HENKY KISSINGER as Secretary of State as well
as the fact that the NIXON administration is cténtrolled by
his high-ranking Jewish advisors and by political contributions
furnished by the Jewish population in this country. He also

stated that all sectors of the news media are controlled by
Jovs and that they directly control all newspaper publications
either by direct ownership or by controlling the advertising
that newspapers need for their survival, In addition, he
pointed out that the three major radio~television networks
are all headed by Jewish individual and as such they are able
to direct public broadcasting to henefit their own views and
the views of the Jewish segment of our society. DRAGER further
stated that this great influence! exerted by Jews in this
country will eventually lead to the degeneration of our
society unless their haheaah cotiasatuee are stopped by actions from
the right wing.

DRAGER stated that as a result of his travels :
throughout the country he has coordinated activities between
the various right wing groups to such a degree that all that
is needed for them to act in unison would be the right
conditions to exist in this country. Ke feels that his
activities are currently peaceful in nature and that he is
determined to work within the present political system for
change, but if conditions should become too suppressive
toward the average white citizenry in this country, then a
time for action will be at hand and if a violent revolution
is necessary to bring about change, it will be used, When
it is tize for action DRAGER predicted a unification of all
the right wing organizations in this country for the good of
the common man.

DRAGER admitted that he confines his activities
and travels to the area east of the Mississippi River and
that he feels that the West is organized enough. Ue did
admit to having spoken in the past in Pennsylvania, New
York, New Jersey, Toledo,and Columbus, Ohio, and Chicago.

He again declined to comment further regarding his activities
oy indivicuals: he may have been in contact with during his
travels since leaving New Jersey.

DRAGIR refused to coment on any aliases he may
@ or upon the various identifications found in his possession
at the time \of bis arrest in tke nares of DINIS DEAN PITTsr

BLACK PANTHER PARTY,
Also. Known as
Black Panther Zexty for Self-Defense

a

"According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control of
the life, politics and the destiny of the black community. It
was organized by Bobby Seale, BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton,
BPP Minister of Defense. . Newton was sentenced in 1968 to serve
2 to 15 years after being convicted of manslaughter in connection
with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther", which
. further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service",
stated that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to arm
themselves against the police who are consistently referred to a
- the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

/"fhe Black Panther" issue of September 7; 1968, con-
tains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason
Murray, which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth
keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

. Dynamite! Black Power, Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere,"

Ineluded_in the introduction to an article appearing in
the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement ",..we will not dissent. from American Government. We
will overthrow it". .

“Issues of "the Black Panther” regularly contain quo= :
tations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the People's
Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that a ceattinaet
power grows out of the barrel of a gun”.

‘The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been
established at various locations throughout the United States.

Reference is made to communication of this Bureau
- captioned "Unnamed Coalition Being Formed in Richmond, Virginia",
dated December 22, 1969, at Richmond, Virginia.

Referenced communication set forth information relat-
ing to efforts to-organize a "coalition" in Richmond which had
connections with the Black Panther Party (BPP) and which received
impetus for its formation as a result of a visit to Richmond
in September, 1969, by Bob Lee, then the Field Secretary of
the BPP of Illinois. |

A characterization of the BPP is attached hereto.

Contacts during January and February, 1970, with
gonfiden itial source number one and confidential source number
- two, poth of whom have furnished reliable information in the
past, revealed that efforts to form a viable "coalition" in
. Richmond, which "coalition" would in essence be a BPP-sponsored
- committee against Fascism, were meeting with great difficulty.
|. These sources reported that as a result of numerous interviews |
conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the
iene individuals interested in forming the aforementioned “coalition",
I the individuals involved became very Spicious of one another.
These suspicions were heightened, ording to these sources,

also reported that no meetings of: those interested in organiz-
ing the "coalition" had been held since aed January, 1970.

: On March 26, 1970, confidential source number one
reported that the individuals interested in forming the afore-
mentioned "coalition" had become so suspicious of one another
that organizational efforts have been completely stymied and,

_ for the most part, the individuals involved no longer asso-
eiate with one another. 7

Confidential source number one also reported that
no ) meeting of those individuals interested in forming the
"coalition" has been held since early January, 1970, and noted
that no meetings are scheduled.

On April 1, 1970, confidential source number two
reported essentially the same information furnished by confi-
dential source number one on March 26, 1970.

On March 26, 1970, confidential source number one
“.also reported that during February and March, 1970, numerous
efforts were made by Al Jones (considered by some to have
peen the leader of those interested in forming the aforementioned
"coalition") to renew his Black Panther newspaper subscription
.and to get organizational assistance from BPP national head-
quarters. his source advised that these efforts met with
negative results, The source also advised that the reason
for the negative response from the BPP is generally believed
to be caused by the poor sale of Black Panther newspapers in
Richmond, which resulted in Jones being unable to fully pay
his Black Panther newspaper subscription bill.

that the individual may have recontacted him concerning
the request for chemicals, EADS remembers telling the
individual on the second contact that aluminum powder was
not available to the company ia any small quantities and 5
suggested that he (SA8DS) was rather passive with the caller — ‘
inasmuch as he was not interested in furnishing chemicals

to a one~time purchaser inasmuch as it would not ke profitable

to handie that type of transaction on a on¢=time basis in

small quantities requested by the individual,

EADS advised he coujd furnish no further information
concerning the call and stated he could not recall referring
this caller to any competitors wherein he might obtain those
chemicals, At-.this point the interview was terminated,

his brother, LARRY STAFFORD, visited BROWN'ssresidence
in Berea, Kentucky, on July "23, 1974, STAFFORD advised
that he now remembers the nane of the chemical that
BROWN discussed as being thermite. STAFFORD stated that
thexmite was the ingredient which BROWN discussed a

_ need for inasmuch as thermite would finish or be the

venaining chemical to be used in a composition which,
when lit, would create so much heat that it would destroy
any pronze or metal statues ao

STAFFORD Fediseuss ed with the interviewing agent

ci case of BROW's plan to travel.to New York and

piace incendiary and explosive devices in the United Nations
Buliding. STAFFORD, on retelling the story, was positive
that BROW described the basement area of the United
Rations Building where dynamite was to be placed as being
& “meditation place," STAFFORD again described the statue

description, a statue symbolizing Pagan worship or idol.
STAFFORD renembers BROWN dese xibing this statue as being
made of marble and stated that. BROWN discussed a need for
dynamite to destroy this statue inasmuch as the burning
composition inciuding thermite would not do the job on
rock. :

STAFFORD discussed his impress ion of BROWN's
personality and character, desorb ing BROW as a person

. who seemed extremely well read and an individual who seemed

to have a great deal of sophistication, STAFFORD stated
that he bad not seen nor talked to BROWN since his visit

in the purchasing and

selling of various type short and

long barreled weapons. PLANCICH stated that the only information
that would indicate any right wing activities on the part

of ANDERSON were incidents that occurred during the suminer

the Bothell, Washington area carrying sidearms and wearing

camoflage clothing. When investigated by his department,

it was determined that at that time ANDERSON was involved

in what was referred to as "simulated maneuvers" in the

woods around the Bothell, Washington area which PLANCICH

described as being heavily populated by farms and related

businesses. Also during the summer of 1969, a Bothell

Police Officer observed ANDERSON in the company -of several

other white males who were once again conducting some sort

of maneuvers. At this time the officer observed a shotgun

in one of the vehicles, which when measured was just 1/2 inch

over the legal limit. During the early fall of 1969,

ANDERSON approached an officer of the Bothell Police Department

with a weapon to determine if it was legal and under the
“current interpretations of both Federal and state law, it

was opined-.that the weapon ANDERSON had was legal, but no

record was maintained as to the type of weapon.

PLANCICH stated that ANDERSON, in the past, has

4
purchased old Bothell Police Department vehides and it was #
PLANCICH's opinion that ANDERSON did this to satisfy some i
unknown egomania that he felt ANDERSON had. PLANCICH t
stated that he knew of no violent acts committed by ANDERSON i
at any time. i

these sources will be maintained for possible information
on the SAO. a

SAM NAPINR is currently underzoing investigation
as to his possible connection with the Secret Army Organization

group has been endeavoring to take on an organizational
structure since October, 1971, .He states that, while the
group is motivated by the same principles which brought the
Minutemen into existence, the Secret Army Organization (SAO)
is taking a more cautious approach than the Minutemen in
its recruitment of membership, in order to avoid the
assimilation of people of poor reputation,

In California, notably in San Diego, the SAO
has recently had to sift the letters and applications being
received there because of the obvious eccentric type person
endeavoring to find acceptance in the group.

Concerning Arizona, source advised that the SAO
has mailed a considerable amount of literature pertaining
to the SAO to "conservative" thinking people, but has not
at this time received response from the tyne of people they
wish to affiliate. Consequently, no formal chapter or
nucleus around which to organize has been formed in
Arizona. However, a coordinator has been named and is
operating. Source advised that not all former Minutemen
will be accepted into the SAO,

Source advised that the SAO foresees a decentralized
type of operation in each State, where in a revolutionary
situation brought about by treasonous communist elements,
the SAO could present a militant front immediately, Recent

PX T-1 advised on April 26, 1972, that during
his contact with members of the Secret Army Organization
(SAO) in February, 1972, Sam Davis, also known as Jerry
Davis, and one Cy Anderson, posed the question to an SAO
group as to vhat measures could be taken by the SAO to
counter disruptions by revolutionary groups at the
Republican National Convention, This question was never
discussed at great length, but in this connection, one
member suggested that old junk-type cars be parked at
strategic locations where, in the event of confrontation
with dissident elements, the SAO members could have access
to the necessary weapons hidden in the cars. Since the
time of the above discussion, however, SAO leadership
appears to have had second thoughts on the matter because
the latter have been heard to say that they are going
to stay out of San Diego entirely during the Republican
National Convention in order to preclude any untoward
incident that could be attributed to the presence of
the SAO and redound to the discredit of the SAO.

Informant advised that he has not been present
when sources of weapons may have been discussed by the
SAO, but states that he is aware of the fact that leaders
of the SAO have attended gun shows at every opportunity,
notably at Yuma, Arizona, on October 15, 16, 1971, and
again at Yuma on February 25, 26, 1972, and at Phoenix,
Arizona, on March 25, 26, 1972.

Co Secret Army Organization

We note from your letterhead memorandum dated
March 8, 1972 from Phoenix, Arizona, that Jerry Lynn Davis
and other members of the Secret Ariny Organization met in
Yuma, Arizona, and discussed preparations for the forth-
coming Republican National Convention in San Diego, California.
It is also noted from the report of SA Steven L. Christensen
dated March 8, 1972 in San Diego, California, that Davis
viewed the convention as "his big chance to do something that
would be remembered;" and further that he had planned a™
sophisticated alibi to cover any bombings or other terrorist
activities that he may engage in during the convention.

In this connection, it is requested that we be
advised as expeditiously as possible of any further develop-
ments in Davis' plans for the convention including his
acquisition of any weapons or explosives.

The report of SA Christensen also contains
additional information from sources SD T=2 and SD T-3 pointing

and explosive materials, This report further advised that
Davis had purchased $500 worth of M-2 Carbine parts in May,
1971 for the purpose of making M-2 "enforcers," that Davis in
September, 1971 had a cache of several hundred pounds of
explosives including TNT, C-4, and rifle grenades and further
that his group was in possession of three operational Civil
War field artillery pieces with a fourth under construction,

"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and
defend it". Daniel Webster :

Fellow members, : el ‘ ae

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the}
length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second
half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year
will contain material on psychoiogical warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi
-—cations, survival-equipment, first aid, explosives, Weapons, codes, and other rg
lated warfare subjects.

Those hambors who have not yet completed or started on the organization's
basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most cases,
assign any member to aa imps: < underg: d project or to an organized team
or group until they have comgicted this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

_an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their
own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the
best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

- the people he personally knows and irusts. If any member would like to form their
own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send
them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on .”
"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who
wish to form their own Combat Team.

” We are enclosing a small number of S.A.O. stickers with this month's
bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible
stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit.
The stickers ure already gummed and when wet will adhere firmly to glass, metal,
or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with
the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the
rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among
them who are willing to fight for the re-estallishment of a Constitutional Republic.
These first stickers are being sent to euch member free, additional stickers and
Icaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

SOUT TT ae tal
When discussing a oe: Army Organization "Comba am, we usually think
. Of a small group of people Who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement ~
has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective
training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted
with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be
placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who
live closely together to keep from attracting aticntion, thus unit security may be
poor, If one ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,
chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that
we refer to as a"Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members
usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is
the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over
- acomparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In
urban areas one team.member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the
team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member.
being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

‘When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

. forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.

For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of.communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving
“aminimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will
naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between qur
organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve ils ultimate objectives the following activitics must
be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between
the.team and higher command, -(3) maintaining secrecy. of team members, (4) main-
taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-
plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general, ~
and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full tearn, a three
maa‘section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can
then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

“CONE

@ BOOBY TRAPS

Broadly defined a booby Lrap can be any kind of apparatus
fn which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought abour
when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re=
action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare
involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a
trip wire or the moving of some object which is connected to
the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by
signal flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents. The trigger
mechanism may be cither electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical,

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS, Such trigger mechanisms
are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting
caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity,
One of the most common electric type’ booby traps is to simply
interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when
the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This
simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticka of
dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.
To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric
blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while
the other side is attached to a spark plug or the “cold side"
of.the ignition switch, In the first case the cap detonates the
dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to
the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on,

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it
is moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed
-to complete a circuit between a dry cel] battery and the de-
tonator. A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked
along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame
and extending out far enough that contact is made between the
two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger
involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of in-=
sulation at one end as shown in Figure No. 1. When pressure
is applicd, the springs are held apart end when the pressure
is released, the springs come together to meke electrical con-
tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open
the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit, When
the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,
& wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight.
If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of pressure
- Will close the electrical circuit,

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not
leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

* connecting the wirge to the door itself he will t off the door:
frame, place the @..-: mechanism at the edge of Whe door and

. :then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

tw + . “the door is closed.

fi By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole
aes igut’ through the window casing the trigger mechanism can’ be placed
o-that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering
half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing
one.of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When
«tr -eneagh ‘of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no
longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open,

. ' “Figure No. 2 shows another simple electrical trigger made
from a spring clothes pin, The improvised contacts are held
apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.
This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.
When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-
cuit is completed,

A trigger of this type. can be used to make a time delay
- mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by
: a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a’
: - -- fin can, -Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or water is
t placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually
~ £all through into the second can, When the weight of the lower
can becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge
will be pulied from the clothes pin. As an alternate method the
spring may be already stretched out aad held there by a second
' -gord attached to some other solid object. The cord holding the ao
' / spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be-burned.- \-”
f, in two when the candle burned down a certain distance.’ An active
imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type
of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the
“British book trap", In this case ‘a book is hollowed out to
contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNT which
is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes
through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but
are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to
the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case
the contacts come together and the TNT is detonated.

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No,
3, This type of contact fs very useful in placing charges entirely
within a movable object. For example, a suitcase could be laid
on its side with. the contact positioned inside in such a way that
when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward
+ and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be pi@c in closed gasoline cans, c&eons, ammuni-*
tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place
tight side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through
the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in
contact with both of them.

2 A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a
tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first
pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of
water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil
could be used as weil), finally put the cork in the top with the
wire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas
to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

I° up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the
circuit. The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several.
hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and
the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-
factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more
difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard
record centers,- important military or missile bases, etc. but are
seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS, These may be operated either by impact
or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact
trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps
‘against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)
which in turn starts a short fuse to burn, This fuse leads to a
blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

1 : The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade
operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In
this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator. The
plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure
No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying
_pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient to de-~
tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster charge of a
fairly sensitive cxplosive is detonated by the primer and this in
turn detonates the main charge. In military use TNT is by far the
most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains 78
percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,
TNT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy-
lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene~
tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldchyde and
ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PEIN,

A very -simple device can be made from a screen door spring
that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a
trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be
very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe
which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism
is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed
point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed
above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet
releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate
well up into the leg or the body.

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just
like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.
Figure No, 7 shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing
device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with
a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.
When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound
(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the
flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

.@ blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy
cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

- sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

. Many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS, In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer)’

can be used as a trigger mechanism. For example in World War II
the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement them
back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire
was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a
hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode if the
log were used as fuel without ‘being inspected.

& common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal
oil lamps ot lanterns filled with gasoline, An unthinking person
who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned
to death.

. CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. “These are more frequently used in the
construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

shows an Hen. chemical delay igniter, The upper chamber
contains acetone, When the piercing pin is pushed downward it
penetrates the lead disc and allows the acctone to flow into the
lower chamber, The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid
washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied
by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker
rod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker
* 4s held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved
when a solution of acid is allowed to surround it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a
liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-
“tainer having a reactive.substance attached part way-up one wall.
’ The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes
in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter. One
suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture
of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable
combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for
the solid, There are many other combinations which’.a chemist might
- : * improvise from materials at hand.

‘There, are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used
as trigger mechanisms. Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from
- - ‘t ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine
: erystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating
sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece
of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A
small amount of ammonia may be added from time to tine making
[ certain that it does not have the chance to dry out. After three
or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and
partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While
wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,
it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It
may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet
away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount
described above will produce a violent explosion and should be
treated with extreme caution. Several similar compounds will be :
mentioned in the chapter on explosives. , :

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver
fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can - : aaa
be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper
side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape. When the tire rolls
over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy
even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger-
ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armies are supplied with a variety of
manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used
specifically as booby trap material. Most firing devices
are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to
be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges
made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No. 9 shows a
simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in
Figure No. 10, The apparatus at the left side is a trigger
mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire. When it is fired
the flash passes through the "U" tube which propels a 60mm
grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second
delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground
to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of
mine is 5~1/2 pounds. :

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or
mortar shells in demolition work by placing them‘in a large

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any “
value. Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm. In -
those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case,
Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base. For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)

put in its place, ;

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps
in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove
the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects a
strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position. i ee

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud wi
just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has harde

withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along -...

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will release the handle and fire the grenade. A similar .-
trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the... |.
handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn. At nivht these...
may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a :

ear traveling at night ‘with its lights off. When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

Ie seems doubt that man's ingenuity will e be .. j
7 exhausted when it coms to improvising traps of varlWs types. ial

A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb. Open pits (sometimes with~sharp stakes

ai the bottom) coveced with flimsy camouflage is much older chan

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese’ in World

War Ii.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a © ,
victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still at
be useful in guerrilla warfare. : 4

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common,

aa Alcoholic dzinks are easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary
type antifreeze)’ equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol
without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause
blindness or death in a few hcurs. Soft drinks can be easily
poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at
the rate of 2 ounces per bottle, This dose is usually fatal
and once symptoms develop there is no known: antidote.

* When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with
‘one part of powdered sugar it: forms a combination that will
either explode’ (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in
the open. A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful
of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-
“aretve ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that
“particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of
commission for quite some time, Black powder, if available, would
actuaily explode if used in this way.

7 USE OF BOOBY TRAPS J ]
It is obvious that the use of hooby traps favors an army in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

For most efficient use the laying of booby traps must be done in

a planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties, :

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are
preferred Lo a few large ones. Two or more triggers may be
avtached to a single charge. Variety of types and settings is
essential to effective use of booby traps in iavge numbers.

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel H
may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirabie that a written i
. record and detailed maps be kept as to where boopy traps are
placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby
, tvapped they mark it wath a sign which consists of a red triangle

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forees
it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-
plode when Pears removed by personnel attempting to clear the
area,

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to bech guerrilla
and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two
basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas
ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use
of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot
they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have
placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy
column strikes a mine or drives on to a tridge which is dynamited.
Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in’
the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions.
behind, Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek’
cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro=
tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they
will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla
forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby
traps. When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas
they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas
in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplies may be
heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting
a short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these ©
things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under
surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid,
They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel, If
the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route
it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies
are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that
they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general aréa
guerrilla forces shou ld guard against surprise by other enemy
forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces
should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real
booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be
safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations
and take just as much time doing so as if they were real. If the
enemy becomes carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will

“xn the danger of getting killed by a live one. In planning the
path of their retreat gucrrilla forces should booby trap alternate
- routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.

SELETIN

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS —— JANUARY 1972

"God. grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and
defend it", Daniel Webster

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the
length of this article we are only sending ont the first half this month. The second
half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year
will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-
cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other re-
lated warfare subjects.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's
basic training programs ar hereby urged to do so. We cannct, in most cases,
assign any member to an imps uid project or to an organized team

or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to
an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and forra their
own combat team (see December 197i Bulletin). In many cases this may be the
best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with
the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their
own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send.
them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on
"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who
wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S.A. 0. stickers with this month's
bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfcid and as soon as possible
stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or cther public places that you visit.
‘Yhe stickers are already gummed and when wet wiii adhere firmly to glass, metal,
or any other smooth surface, If our members wouid use these stickers along with
the leaflets that are availuble, it would have a real psychological impact on the
rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among
them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.
These first stickers are being sent lo cuch 5 bor free, additional stickers and

leaficts can be ordered on the monthly report form. = vi

TH DISPERSED TEA

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think
of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement
has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective
training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted
with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be
placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who
live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be
poor. If one y ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested. by the enemy,
chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to-experiment with a new arrangement that
we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members
{usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is
the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over ~
a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In
urban, areas one team-member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the
team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member
being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling,

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical
forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages a
For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically
has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send
his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a
larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.
Operations of saboiage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,
raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving
a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will
naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our
organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activities must
be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between
the team and higher command, {3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (4) main-
taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-
plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,
and of individual members in their own specialties.

. When the required personnel are not available to form a full tearm, a three
maa section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can
then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Broadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus
fn which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought abouc
when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re-
action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare
involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a
trip wive or the moving of some object which is connected to
the trigger mechanism,

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by
signsl flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents, The trigger
mechanism may be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical,

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS, Such trigger mechanisms
are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting
caps ate available and also a suitable source of electricity.
One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply
interrupt the electrical circuit in ‘some building so that ‘when
the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This
simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticks of
dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.
To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric
blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while
the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"
of the ignition switch. In the first case the cap detonates the
dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to
the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on,

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it
is moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed
to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the dee
tonetor, A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked
along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame
and extending out far enough that contact is made between the
two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger
involvee two small springs separated by some thin piece of ine
suletion at one end as shown in Figure No. 1. When pressure
is applied, the springs are held apart and when the pressure
is released, the springs come togethex to taake electrical con+
tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open
the awitch while the explosive is wized into the circuit. When
the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes,

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,
a wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight,
If the chair is moved or tiie box Lifted the release of pressure
. will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not
-leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

connecting the wires to the door itself. he will take off the decor
frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the docr and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when
the door is closed.

By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole
out through the window casing the trigger mechanism can’ be placed
so that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering
a half open window. 5

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged. by placing
one of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When
enough of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no
longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open,

Figure No. ‘2 shows another simple electrical trigger made
from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held
apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.
When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-
cuit is completed,

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay
mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by
a loose cord to the end of a spring which is aiso attached to a
tin can. Above this a second tin can full of sand or water is
placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually
fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower
can becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge
will be pulied from the ciothes pin. As an alternate method the :
spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second
cord attached to some other solid object. :The cord holding the
spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned
in two when the candle burned down a certain distance. An active
imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type
of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the
"British book trap", In this case a book is hollowed out to
contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNT which
is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes
through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but
are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to
the back of the bookcase, If the book is withdrawn from the case
the contacts come together and the TNT is detonated,

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figere No.
3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely
within a movable object. For example, a suitcase could be laid
on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that
when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward
+ and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be placed in closed gasoline cans, canteens, ammuni-~
tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place
right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through
i the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in
contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a
tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first
pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of
water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil
could be used as weil), finally put the cork in the top with the
wire sticking down through. The water will cause the dried peas
H to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

I. up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the
circuit. The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several
hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and
the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-
factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more
difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard
record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are
seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact
or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact
trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps a
against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shelly
which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a
: blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade
eperates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In
this case a spring activaced plunger strikes a detonator. The
plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure
No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No, 5 or by applying
_pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient. tr
tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster charge oft: -
fairly sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this t+
turn detonates the main charge. In military use TINT is by far the
most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains +3
percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolun:
TINT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy~ oa
lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethy Lene.
tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldehyde and .
ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PEIN,
Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate. Characteris~
tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in
‘another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring
that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a
trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be
very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe
which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism
is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed
point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed
above the ground, The weight of a man stepping on the bullet
releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate
well up into the leg or the body, “

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.
i Figure No. 7 shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing — am
i device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with

a gritty substance much like the strip on a beok of matches,

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse ox fire

a blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by
sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with
match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy
cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both
sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in
many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects
to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS, In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer) °*
ean be used as a trigger mechanism. For example In World War IL. ..
the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement £1 Feeee
back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire ms

Hl was built, A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a
| r hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode if the
log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal
oil lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline, An unthinking person
who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

1 , to death.

CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used in the

construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No, 8

shows an Italian chemical delay igniter. The upper chamber
contains acetone. When the piercing pln is pushed downward it
penetrates the lead disc and allows the acetone to flow into the
lower chamber, The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid
washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied
by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker
rod,

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker
is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved
when a solution of acid is allowed to surround .it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a
liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-
tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.
The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes
in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter. One
suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture

| of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable
combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for
the solid, There are many other combinations which a chemist might
improvise from materials at hand.

There, are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used
as trigger mechanisms. Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from
ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine
crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating
sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece

: of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution, A
small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making
certain that -it does not have the chante to dry out. After three
or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and
partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While
wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,
it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It
may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden ficor several feet
away or a door being closed in the same building. ‘The amount
described above will produce a violent explosion and should be
treated with extreme caution. Several similar compounds will be
mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver
fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coay'se sand can
be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper
side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape. When the tire rolls
over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy
even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger-
ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armies are supplied with a variety of
manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used
specifically as booby trap material. Most firing devices
are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to
be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges
made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No. 9 shows a
simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in
Figure No, 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger
mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire. When it is fired
the flash passes through the "U" tube which propels a 60mm
grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second
delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground
to shower metal fragments over a wide area, Total weight of

on

mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large

pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,
the projectile of an artillery shell is the only part of any

value. Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm. In
those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,
it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.
Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

7 in the base. For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be
unscrewed and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)
put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps
in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove
the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects
strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with
just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,
it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be
withdrawn. These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along
a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile
tire which will release the handle and fire the grenade. A similar
trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the
handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn, At night these
may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a
car traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles
break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity will ever be

exhausted when it comes to improvising traps of various types.

A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb. Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes

ai the bottom) covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese’ in World

War Il.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a
victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still
be useful in guerrilla warfare,

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.
Alcoholic dzinks are easily diluted with wood alcckol (temporary
type antifreeze)’ equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol
without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause
blindness or death in a few hcurs. Soft drinks can be easily
poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at
the rate of 2 ounces per bottle. This dose is usually fatal
and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote.

“ When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with
one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will
either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in
the open. A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful
of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-

‘aretre ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of
commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would
actually explode if used in this way.

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of booby traps favors an army_-in
retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.
For most efficient use the laying of booby traps rust be done in
a planned and cgordinated method. When time permits the entire
area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement
of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,
impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties,

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are
preferred to a few large ones. ‘Two or more triggers may be
attached to a single charge. Variety of types and settings is
essential to effective use of booby traps in large numbers.

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel
may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable that a written
record and detailed maps be kept as to where boopy traps are
placed. When U.S, Army troops discover a place that is booby
trapped they mark it with a sign which consists of a red triangle

pointed downward with a white circle in the middle and the word
booby traps painted in white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces
it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-
plode when being removed by personnel attempting to clear the
area,
The use of booby traps is very adaptable to bcch guerrilla
and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two
basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas
ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use
of the booby traps. Jn raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot
they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have
placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy
column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.
Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in
the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions
behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expdéted to seek
cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-
tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they
will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla
forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby
traps. When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas
they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas
in slightly protected warehouses as traps. These supplics may be
heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting
a short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these
things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their et under
surveillance for several hours or days before ‘making the raid,
They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel. If
the enemy is very careful to always. come and go by the same route
it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies
are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that
they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general area
guerrilla forces shou ld guard against surprise by other enemy
forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces
should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real
booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be
safe the enemy will have to go around or de¢-activate the imitations
and take just as much time doing so as if they were real, If the
enemy becomes carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will
run the danger of getting killed by a live one. In planning the
path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate
routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.
