he declined to coment on the names of any nembers or of

the total number of individuals involved in the WAll. DRAGER

stated the ain of his moverent was victory for all right

wing organizations and this was to be accomplished through

political elections or other necessary nsthods.

Bis methods

included preaching to the public concerning goals of his

organization and by supporting the right type of individuals

for public office. He considered BOB MIles, who is presently

incarcerated in the Federal Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas,

to be the type of individual qualified to hold public office.

DRAGER stated that his WAM has adopted a philosophy

of being the coordinator between all right wing organizations

currently operating in this country.

He stated that the

strategies and ideals of all right wing groups actually are

very sinilar and that when the corditions are right there

will be a unilication for all these groups into one large

organization that will effectively be able to take control

of the country.

He stated he originally founded the WAM iD

1970 and for a time published and distributed literature

an attempt to educate the public concerning his belleis.

He advised that WAll was unable to accomplish its goals as

an above ground organization and as a result several years

ago he decided to take the organization "under ground"

Although there is no longer any formal organization of

financial backing, WAll still has its officers and nembership

but the extent of its activities consists of himself and

others

traveling the country preaching the right wing philosophy

to any group that will listen. DRAGER declined to comment

on the number of individuals presently in WAM but did state

he had previously issued 300 membership caras.

He again

declined coment concerning the names of any of the organiza

tion's leadership or its membership.

He did state that the

Majority of liAM members were disillusioned members or other

right wing organizations. He advised the uniform of WAl

half swastika emblem on the collar.

This is the uniform he

usually wears during his speaking engagements.

DRAGER stated that recently he had been vacationing

in Florida, living mainly on previous savings.

He did work

for approximately 17 days as a chef at the Ocean Reef Club,

Rey largo, Florida. He was paid $250 per week there and had

accumulated about $500 at the time of his departure from the

Florida Keys area. He also advised he was currently existing

on survival tablets, taking up

to 12 tablets daily as a

method to supplement his normal meals. He stated he could

easily maintain his health and weight by use or these tablets.

DRAGER claimed that he is traveling by camper truck and that

dual who was arrested with him by local authorities in New

NW 55130 DocId: 32989569 Page 47

## Page 48

SI 157-4275

that BROIRICK contacted his lawyer concerning the pending

charges in New Jersey and has probably returned to New Jersey.

DRAGER did admit to past memberships in the American

Nazi Party, National Socialist White Peoples Party, Ku Klux

Klan, Knights of Constantine, as well as generally claiming

menbership in all right wing organizations at one time or

another during the pasi 15 years.

He stated he was recently the self-appointed Acting

Grand Dragon of the

Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey.

He felt the

organization needed leadership and that he had the respect

other leaders in the group, but did have some conflicts

with some other independent klan organizations in New Jersey. "

DRAGER stated that he, in the past, has been

harassed by local authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investi

gation but that he has never had any problems with any of the

leadership of any right wing organization.

He claimed he is not currently a member of the

Minutenen organization but that he does personally know

ROBERT DEPUCH. He declined to comment on the last time he

had any communications with DEPUGH.

DRAGER stated he personally knows several individuals

in Chicago.

He advised that from 1961-1967 he was a member

of thel American Nazi Party and worked in its national head-

quarters in Arlington, Virginia.

He worked closely with

GEORGE LINCOIN ROCKVELL during this period as his second in

command although he would never accept any rank higher than

lieutenant.

For a period during 1961-1967 he worked mainly

at the party's training camp in Pennsylvania as the individual

in charge of the printing of all literature for the party.

After ROCKWELL's death, DRAGER advised he was asked to tale

command of the party but he declined because of his past

criminal record, a decision he regrets to this day. Approxi

mainly three nonths after ROCHilLL's death he left the Nazi

Party. DRAGER feels that MATT KOEHL, the present commander

of the party, has the guts but not the know how to run the

party organization.

He does not feel that he has the charisma

that ROCKYELL has and he does not reach the public effectively

with the party's message. DRAGER stated he currently has no

association with the American Nazi Party or with the National

Socialist White Poples Party.

DRAGER advised he Inows no one in Illinois associated

with the American NazI Party of the National Doczalist hite

Peoples carty and the nans Dill Ductsk mans

• little to bin.

He does recall vaxiuR writing to his lini but stated Dextin

was not at Nazi Party Headquarters in Arlington during the

sale period that le served there.

He advised that he knows no one in the Phoenix,

Arizona area since the death of WeSTEROK PaKO (phonetic).

He knows of no right wing activity in that area but he did

recall in the past he communicated with a Nazi

Party member

there but he no longer recalls this individual's name.

DRAGER stated that all of his travels are basically

politically notivated and that

the main philosophy of his

WAll is victory for white Christianity and a return to the

natural order.

He

feels that the white sace was placed on

this earth as the "gifted race" and that a geographical

separation of the races is necessary to prevent interbreeding

of the races. lie contributes the basis of his beliefs to

the writings of HISIER but stated that many of the ancient

philosophers preached the same white supremacy philosophy.

He believes that interbreeding of the races will eventually

lead to the degeneration of our society and its eventual

downfalle

DRAGER stated that in the event the political

systen fails as a means for the right wing groups in this

country to save the country from its external and internal

enemies, then any other means necessary will be used to achieve

their goals. He feels thai if the Government will not act

to save the

country then right wing organizations must act to

do so.

DRAGER stressed the danger of an internal enemy in

the form of an overly suppressive Government that would no

lonjer act for the Foll-boing of the average white Arerican.

Although he stated

again that the right wing extrenist

organizations will astenpt to gain pover by legitinate political

process, it this process should break down any method, including

that of violence, would be used to accomplish their goals.

He stated the targets of the right wing would be any suppressive

NW 55130-DocId: 32989569. Page 49

SI 157-4275

5

Govornient agencies or any left wing organization that would

be doing the

"bidding" of the suppressive Covernment in

power.

Additional targots of the right wing would include

the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Fevenue

Service, and such organizations as

the Jewish Anti-Defanation

League, who although is not a Government agency, he feels

it receives its authority to act from the Governnent.

DRAGER agreed that to succeed in the violent over

throw of the country a supply of weapons and ammunition would

be necessary.

He stated he knows of no right wing organiza-

tion who currently has a stockpile of weapons and advised

that the source of weapons at the right time would be the

United States military establishment, whose leaders and

white members he predicts will join his cause when it is

time for action. Although he has heard that the Minutemen

organization was stockpiling weapons, he has no evidence that

that organization currently has any large supply of weapons

in its possession.

He stated that he also felt that all the state

units of Government will join his cause at the right time

that they will revolt against the suppression placed on

then by the Federal Government. He feels that even personnel

of the Federal Bureau of investigation will join his cause

because of their basic conservative

beliefs and because of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation's concern for the good

of the country.

He feels that the Federal Bureau of Investi

gation is now only a "pawn" of the Justice Department from

which it receives its orders.

DRAGER continued tosstate his personal philosopay

concerning the power and iniluence exerted by the Jewish

population in this country:

He considers the total Jewish

control on tha lnerican political system io le the greatest

internal threat present today in our system. He believes

that the Cormunist movement, all racial organizations, and

all liberal loft wing organizations operating in this

country are tools of the Jewish population in the United

States. le predicts a complote economic takeover by the

Jewish

segiant os our socioty. Is craigios of the extent

of the jewish control in

this

country, DIAGER uSes the

appointment of HuNkY KISSINGIR as secretary of State as

we 11

as the fact that the NIXON administration is controlled by

his high-ranking Jewish advisors and by political contributions

furnished by the Jevich population in this country. le also

SI 157-4275

sinted that all sectors of the nows media are controlled by

Jors and that they dirccily control all newspaper publications

either by direct ownership or by controlling the advertising

that newspapers need for their survival.

In addition, he

pointed out that the three major radio-television networks

are all headed by Jewish individual and as such they are able

to diret public broadensting to bonefit their own views and

the views of the Jewish segnent of our society. DIGI! further

stated that this great influence exerted by Jews in this

country will eventually lead to the degeneration of our

society unless their activities are stopped by actions from

the right wing.

DRAGER stated that as a result of his travels

throughout the country he has coordinated activities between

the various right wing groups to such a degree that all that

is needed for them to act in unison would be the right

conditions to exist in this country. He feels that his

activities are currently peaceiul in nature and that he is

determined to work within the present political system for

change, but if conditions should become too suppressive

toward

the average white citizenry in this country, then a

time for action wilt be at hand and if a violent revolution

is necessary to bring about change, it will be used. When

2c is tine for action DRAGER predicted a unification of all

the right wing organizations in this country for the good of

the comnon man.

DRAGER

admtted that he contines his activities

and travels to the area east of the Mississippi River and

that he feels that the West is organized enough. lle did

admit to having spoken in the past in Feunsylvania, New

York, New Jersey, Foledo, and Columbus, Chio, and Chicago.

He again declined to comment further regarding his activities

or individuals he may have been in contact with during his

travels since leaving New jersey.

DINGER refused to coment on any aliases he may

use or upon the various identiticatIons round In his possessioi

at the tine lot his arrest in the nares of DINiS DaAN LIa

Referenced communication set forth information relat-

ing to eiforts to organize a

"coalition" in Richmond which had

connections with the Black Panther

Farty (BPP) and which received

impetus for its formation as a result of a visit to Richmond

In September,

1969, by Bob Lee, then the Field Secretary of

the BPP of Illinois.

A characterization of the BPP is attached hereto.

- Ено,

both of whom have furnished reliable information in the

past, revealed that efforts to form a viable "coalition" in

Richmond, which "coalition" would in essence be a BPP-sponsored

committee against Fascism, were meeting with great difficulty.

These sources reported that as a result of numerous interviews

conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (ABIl coalitIon",

Individuals interested in forming the aforementioned

the individuals involved became very suspicious of one another.

suspicions were heightened, gecording to these sources,

when the FBI arrested George Soniaoode. Jes in mid-February,

During January and February, 1970, these sources

also reported that no meetings of those interested in organiz-

ing the "coalition" had been held since early January, 1970.

On March 26, 1970, confidential

source number one

reported that the individuals interested in forming the afore-

mentioned "coalition" had become so suspicious of one another

that organizational efforts have been completely stymied and,

tor the most part, the indiviauals involved no longer asso-

ciate with one another.

Confidential source number one also reported that

no meeting.

of those individuals interested in forming the

"coalition" has been held since early January, 1970, and noted

that no meetings are scheduled.

On April 1, 1970, confidential source number two

reported essentially

the same information furnished by confi-

dential source number one on March 26, 1970.

On March 26, 1970, confidential source nunber one

also reported that during February ana March, 1970, numerous

efforts were made by Al Jones (considerea by

some to have

been the leader of those interested in forming the aforementioned.

"coalition") to renew his Black Panther newspayer subscription

,and

to get

organizational assistance from BPP national head-

quarters.

This source advised that these efforts met with

negative results. The source also advised that the reason

for the negative response from the BeP is generally believed

to be caused by the poor sale of Black Panther newspapers in

Richmona, which resulted in

Jones being unable to fully pay

his Black Panther newspaper subscription bill.

VILLIAL JUNIOR STAFFORD, 1108 Claridge DIIVE,

Lexington, kentucky, known io interviewing agent as

JAY STAFFORD, through previous association and interview,

furnished the following intornation: -

STArTORD advised that he had been searching his

memory for the name of a chemical previously discussed

with him by MIke BROWN on the ccasion then STAFfOlD and

in Berca, Kentucky, on July

that he now remembers the name of the chemical that

BROWN discussed as being thermite. STAFFORD stated that

theimite was the ingredient which BROWN discussed a

need for inasmuch as thermite would finish or be the

remaining chemical to be used in a composiion which,

then lii, would create so much heat that it would destroy

any bronze or metal statue:

STAFFORD rediscussed with the interviewing agent

pecticulars of BROWN's plan to travel. to New York and

place incendiary and explosive devices in the United Nations

Building.

StArronD, on retelling the story, was positive

that BROWN described the basement area or tne united

Nations Building where dynamite was to be placed as being

a "meditation place." STATTORD again described the staiue

1n this 'heditation place" as being, according to BROWN's

description, a statue symbolizing Pagan worship of idol.

STAFTORD remembers BROWN describing this statue as being

made of marble and siated that BROWN discussed a need for

dynamite to destroy this statue inasmuch as the burning

composition including thermite would not do the job on

sock.

STAITORD discussed his impression of BROWN's

personality and character, deschbing BROWN as a person

who seemed extremely well read and an individual who seemed

to have a great deal of sophistication.

STAFFONd stated

that he bad not seen nor talked to BROWN since his visit

ou July 23, 1973.

bore.

A third cannon wes observed by these Special Agents

the same dey in the backyard of the McDede residence by driving

up a driveway commonly shared by three houses.

the Bothell, Washington area carrying sidearms and wearing

camoflage clothing.

When investigated by his department,

it was determined that at that time ANDERSON was involved

in what was referred to as "simulated maneuvers" in the

woods around the Bothell, Washington area which PLANCICH

described as being heavily populated by farms and related

businesses.

Also during the summer of 1969, a Bothell

Police Officer observed ANDERSON in the company of several

other white males who were once again conducting some sort

of maneuvers. At this time the officer observed

a shotgun

in one of the vehicles, which when measured was

just 1/2 inch

over the legal limit. During the early fall of 1969,

ANDERSON approached an officer of the Bothell Police Department

with a weapon to determine if it was legal and under the

current interpretations of both Federal and state law, it

was opined that the weapon ANDERSON had was legal, but

nO

record was maintained as to the type of weapon.

PLANCICH stated that ANDERSON, in the past, has

purchased old Bothell Police Department

vehides and it was

PLANCICH's opinion that ANDERSON did this to satisfy some

unknown egomania that he felt ANDERSON had.

PLANCICH

stated that he knew of no violent acts committed by ANDERSON

at any time.

PLANCICH stated that the only close friends and

acquaintances that he knows of ANDERSON's are as follows:

while the

group is motivated by the same principles which brought the

Minutemen into existence, the Secret Army Organization (SAO)

is taking a more cautious approach than the Minutemen in

its recruitment of membership, in order to avoid the

assimilation of

people of poor reputation.

in California, notably in San Diego, the SAC

nas recently had to sift the letters and applications beins

received

there because of the obvious eccentric type person

endeavoring to find acceptance in the group.

Concerning

Arizona, source advised that the SAO

has mailed a considerable amount of literature pertaining

to the S10 to "conservative" thinking people, but has not

at this time received response from the type of people they

wish to affiliate.

Consequently, no formal chapter or

nucleus around which to organize

has been formed in

Arizona.

However, a coordinator has been named and

is

operating. Source advised that not all former Minutemen

will be accepted into the s10.

Source advised that the SAO foresees a decentralized

type of operation

in each State, where in a revolutionary

situation brought

about by treasonous communist elements,

the SAO could present a militant front immediately. Recent

PX T-I advised on April 26, 1972, that during

his contact with members of the

also known

as Jerry

counter disruptions by revolutionary groups at the

Republican National Convention.

This question was never

discussed at great length, but in this connection, one

member suggested that old

junk-type cars be parked at

in the event of confrontation

strategic locations where the 5A0 members could have access

with dissident elements,

to the necessary weapons hidden in the cars.

Since the

time of the above discussion, however, SA0 leadership

appears to have had second thoughts on the matter because

the latter have been heard to say that they are going

to stay out of San Diego entirely during the Republican

National Convention in order to preclude any untoward

incident that could be attributed to the presence of

the SAO and redound to the discredit of the SAO.

Informant advised that he has not been present

when sources of weapons may have been discussed by the

SAO, but states that he is aware of the fact that leaders

of the SAO have attended gun shows at every opportunity,

notably at Yuma, Arizona, on October 15, 16, 1971, and

again at Yuma on February

40, 26, 1972, and

at Phoenix,

Arizona, on March 25, 26, 1972.

Source advises that the Secret Army Organization

is a new paramilitary group that has been

formed in California to replace the Minutemen

organization.

It is composed of ex-Minutemen

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JANUARY 1972

"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and

defend it".

Daniel Webster

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the

length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second

half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year

will contain material on psychoiogical warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-

cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other ag

lated warfare subjacts.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's

basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most cases,

assign any member to an important undergaound project or to an organized team

or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their

own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the

best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their

own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send

them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on

"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who

wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S. A. O. stickers with this month's

bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible

stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit.

The stickers arc alrcady gummed and when wet will adhere firmly to glass, metal,

or any other smooth surface. If our members would use these stickers along with

the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the

rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among

them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.

These first stickers are being sent to cach member frce, additional stickers and

leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

When discussing a

ret Army Organization "Combat

cam"', we usually think

of a small group of people

mão live very close to one another.

Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective

training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be

placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who

live closely together to keep from attracling atiention, thus unit sccurity may be

poor. If one 'ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,

chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into tivo sections as is

the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In

urban areas one team member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member.

being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

• When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

: forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.

For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will

naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between ar

organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activitics must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between

the. team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (1) main-

taining a continuous and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-

plies and equipment for present and future needs, (G) training of the team in general,

and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full tearn, a thrce

man section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can

then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Broadly defined a booby Lap can be any kind of apparatus

En which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about

when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re-

action. The most coumon types of booby traps used in warfare

Involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of a

trip wire or the moving of some object which is connected to

the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charge máy be replaced by

signal flares, gas, snoke or other chemical agents.

The trigger

mechanism may be cither electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS. Such trigger mechanisms

are very easily arranged wherever a

supply of electric blasting

caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply

Interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when

the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This

simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticka of

dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric

blasting cap can be attached to any metal part of the car while

the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

of the Ignition switch. In the first case the cap detonates the

dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to

the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on.

Any novable object can be booby trapped so that when it

is moved some simple type electrical switch contact is closed

•to complete a circuit between a dry cell. battery and

tonator.

A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked

along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame

and extending out far enough that contact is made between the

two when the door is opened. a slightly more refined trigger

Involves two small springs separated by some thin plece of 1n-

sulation at one end as snown in Figure No. l. When pressure

is applica, the springs are held apart and when the pressure

1s released, the syrings come together to make electrical con-

tact. This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open

the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit.

the door is opened pressure is released

and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,

a wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight.

If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of preasure

• will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled In the placement of booby traps will not

leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

Hy taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole

"out through the window casing the trigger mechanism can' be placed

za-that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering

=*a half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing

criendagh these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When

of the water evaporates, the weight of the jai will no

longer be sufficient to hold

the contacts open.

Figure No. '2 shows another simple electrical trigger made

from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held

apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.

When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-

cult is completed.

A trigger of this type, can be used to make a time delay

i mechanism in many different ways. The wedge may be connected by

a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a

...... tiri can. • Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or

water is

placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents

gradually

" fall through into the second can.

When the weight of the lower

can becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge

will be pulled from the clothes pin. As an alternate method the

spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second

cord attached to some other solid object. The cord holding the

spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned....

In two when the candle burned down a certain distance. An

active

Imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type

of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

"British book trap". In this casela book is hollowed out to

-contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of INT which

Is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes

through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but

are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to

the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case

the contacts come together and the INT is detonated.l

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.

3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely

within a movable object.

For example, a suitcase could be laid

on its side with. the contact positioned inside in such a way that

when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward

• and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

traps could be pl

d in closed gasoline cans, ca

cens, ammuni-

tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place

right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instcad of a metal case by sticking two wires through

the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a

tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first

pour in a quantity of dried

peas, then a measured amount of

water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil

be used as weil), finally put the cork in the top with the

wire sticking down through.

The water will cause the dried peas

to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the

circuit. The time can be regulated. from a few minutes to several.

hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and

the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-

factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more

difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard

record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are

• seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact

or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact

trigger. When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps

against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)

which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade

operates much

like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In

this case a spring activated plunger

strikes a detonator. The

plunger may be rcleased by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure

No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying.

• pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient to de-.

tonate most military explosives.

Generally a booster charge of a

fairly sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this in

turn detonates the main charge. In military use INT is by far the

most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains 78

percent RDX and 22% plasüicizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolune,

TNT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrinethy-

lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene-

tetramine (which is obtained by the Icaction of formaldchyde and

ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PETN.

Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

discontinued mercury fulminat

Characteris-

tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activatcd by a

trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an

ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed

above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet

releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate

well up into the leg or the body:

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No. I shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing

device, pull friction type i1-2. The coated wire is covered with

& gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy

cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

• sides.

In fleld use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS. In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer)'

can be used as a trigger mechanism.

For example in World War II

the Germans wore known to tear down fireplaces and cement them

back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire

was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a

hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode 1f the

1og were used

as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal

01l lamps oi lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person

who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

to death.

CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used in the

construction of time bombs than In booby traps. Figure No. 8

shows an Itali

chemical delay igniter. The upper chamber

contains acetone. When the piercing pin is pushed downward it

penetrates the lead disc and

allows the acctone to flow into the

Lower chamber.

The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid

washer which holds back the striker. The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker

rod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker

Is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved

when a solution of acid is allowed to surround it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a

liquid is allowed io drop through a small hole into a lower con-

tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.

The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes

in contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter.

One

suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture

of potassium chlorate and sugar for the

solid. Another suitable

combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for

the solid. There are many other combinations which a chemist might

improvise from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used

as trigger mechanisms.

Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from

ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine

crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating

sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish..

Place two or three teaspoons of lodine crystals in a piece

of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A

small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making

certain that it does not have the chance to dry out.

After three

or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and

partly evaporated from the iodine it can be left to dry out. While

wet ammonium tri-jodide is reasonably safe to handle.

When dry,

It is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It

may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden

• floor several feet

away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount

described above will produce a violent explosion and should be

treated with extreme caution.

Several sinilar compounds will be

mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver

be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper

side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape. When the tire rolls

over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy

even a husky truck tire. These combinations also arc very danger-

ous to handle.

CONFIDE TIAN

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armics are supplied with a variety of

manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used

specifically as booby trap material.

Most firing devices

are threaded on onc end with a standing size that allows them to

be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges

made from mortar or artillery sholls.

Figure No. 9 shows a

simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in

Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger

mechanism

that can be operated by a trip wire.

When it is fired

the flash

passes through the "U" tube which propels a 60mm

grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a li'S second

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground

to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of

mine is 5-1/2 pounds.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large

• pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an

artillery shell is the only part of any

value.

Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm.

In

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base.

For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed and a standard firing device (Ml0 Universal destructor)

put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps

in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove

the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects

strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with

just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,

it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn.

These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered alrng -.

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will relcase the handle and fire the grenade. A similar

trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold ths...

handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn.

At night theee.:

may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a

car traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

CONJURI

: It seems doubt

that man's ingenuity will e

be

exhausted when it sumes to improvising traps of various types.

A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb.

Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes

ai the bottom; coverud with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese

'in World

War II.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a

victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still

be useful in guerrilla wartare.

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.

Alcoholic diinks are casily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary

type antifreeze) equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol

without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause

blindness or death in a few hours.

Soft drinks can be easily

poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at

the rate of 2 ounces per bottle.

This dosc is usually fatal

and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote.

When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that vill

either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in

the open.

e new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful

of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-

aretie ashes.

The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of

commission for quite some time.

Black powder, if available, would

actually explode if used in this way.

• USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of booby traps favors an army in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

For most efficient use the laying of booby traps rust be done in

a planned ind coordinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties.

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are

preferred lo a few large ones.

Two or more triggers may be

autached to a single charge.

Variety of types and settings is

essential to effective use

of booby traps in ialge numbers.

In the event that friendly troops or your own personnel

may iC-enter such an area later on, it is desirabic that a written

record and detailed maps be kept as to where boody traps are

placed.

When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby

, trapped they mark it with a sign which consasts of a red triangle

It is common practice to booby trip the mines so they will ex-

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to boch guerrilla

and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfarc involves two

basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas

ambush regular army forces, they arc the ones that will make usc

of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy

garrison or supply depot

they must beware of booby traps that the

rogular forces have

placed

to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.

Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions

behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek

cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-

tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

• will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before mäking any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby

traps. When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas

they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas

In slightly protected warehouses as traps.

These supplies may be

heavily booby trapped

and counter guerrilla forces may

be waiting

& short distance away to take pursuit.

To guard against these

things,

the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under

surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel.

If

the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same

route

It may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies

are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that

they are being used to bait a trap. By scouting the general area

guerrilla forces should guard against surprise by other enemy

forces waiting within danger distance.

After making cither a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces

should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit.

Real

booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be

safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations

and take just as much time doing so as if they were Ical. If the

enemy becomes carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will

run the danger of getting killed by a live onc.

In planning the

path of their retrcat gucrrilla.

forces should booby trap alternate

• routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.

Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the

length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second

half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year

will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-

cations, survival equipment, firsi aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other re-

lated warfare subjects.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's

basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannct, in most cases,

assign any member to an importani undergroud project or to an orgarized team

or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their

own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the

best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to forn their

own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send.

them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet. The article on

"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who

wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S. A. O. stickers with this month's

bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfoid and as soon as possible

sticis them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit.

The stickers are already gummed and when wet will adhere firmly to glass, metal,

or any other smooth surface.

If our members wouid use these stickers along with

the leaflets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the

rest of the Amcrican people and give them evidence that there are still these among

them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.

These first stickers are being sent lo each member free, additional stickers and

leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

HE DISPERSED TEAM

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think

of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective

training and tearn operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographical area. If forced to leave this area the team may be

placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who

live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be

poor. If one ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,

chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team has the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is

the old team. The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In

urban areas one team member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member

being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages.

For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will

naturally be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our

organization and our country's communist chemies develops.

Il the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following astivities must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the leam, (2) communications between

the team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrcey of team members, (4) main-

laining a continuous and cilcetive propaganda effort, (f) obtaining the necessary sup-

plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,

and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three

man section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can

then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Expadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus

an which a reaction untavorable to the enemy is brought about

when he unintentionally maies some act which triggers the re-

action.

The most common types of booby traps used in mariare

involve an explosive charre which is set cit by movement of a

trlp wire or the moving of some object which is connected to

the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive chaiga may be replaced by

signal flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents.

The trigger

mechanism may

be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS.

Such trigger mechanisms

are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting

caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply

Interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when

the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. Thia

simple procedure applied to an automobile with

a few sticka of

dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

To booby trap a car in this manner one side of the electric

blasting cap san be attached to any metal part of the car while

the other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

of the ignition switch.

In the first case the cap detonates the

dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to

the key switch detonating occurs when the ignition is turned on.

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it

some simple type electrical switch contact is closed

to complete a circuit between a dry cell battery and the deo

tonator.

A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked

along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame

extending out far enough that contact is made between the

two when the door is opened. A slightly more refined trigger

Involves two small springs separated by some thin piece of in

sulation at one end as shown in Figuie No. 1.

When pressure

Is applied, the springs are held apart and when the pressure

Is released, the springs come together to make electical con-

This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open

awitch while the explosive is wired into the circuit.

When

the door is opened pressure is released and the charge explodes.

This simple triggei can be placed under the leg of a chair,

a wooden box or any other movable object of iufficient veight.

If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of pressure

• will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not

leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead nE

connecting the wires to the door itself he will take off the door

frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the doci and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

the door is closed.

By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole.

out through the window casing the

trigger mechanism can'be placed

so that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering

a half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing

one of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water. When

enough of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no

longer be sufficient to hold

the contacts open.

Figure No. 2 shows another simple electrical trigger made

from a spring clothes pin. The Improvised contacts are held

apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.

When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-

cult is completed.

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay

mechanism

in many different ways.

The wedge may be connected by

a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a

tin can.

Above this a second tin can full of sand or water is

placed

with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually

fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower

can becomes enough to stretch the spring

sufficiently the wedge

wiil be pulied from the clothes pin.

As an alternate method the

spring may be already stretched out and held there by a second

cord attached to some other solid object. :The cord holding the

spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned

in two when the candle burned down

a certain distance.

An active

Imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type

of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

"British book trap"

• In this case a book is hollowed out to

contain a small battery and

a quarter pound block of TNt which

is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes

through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but

are held apart by some insulating matcrial which is attached to

the back of the bookcase. If the book is withdrawn from the case

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.

3. This type of contact is very useful in placing chaiges entirely

within a movable object.

For example, a suitcase could be laid

on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that

when the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward

• and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

-2-

traps could be placed in closed gasoline cans, canteens, ammuni-

tion boxes or dozens of other objects which an enemy would place

right side up before opening. A plastic or glass test tube

could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires through

the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a

tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first

pour in a quantity of dried peas, then

a measured

amount of

water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil

could be used as well), finally put the cork in the top with the

wire sticking down through.

The water will causa the dried peas

to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the

circuit.

The time can be regulated

from a few minutes to several

hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and

the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-

seldom encountered under battlefield conditions.

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact

or by friction.

The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact

trigger.

When the handle is released a spring operated lever snaps

against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)

which in turn starts a short fuse to burn. This fuse leads to a

blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of a "potato masher" hand grenade

operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In

this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator. The

plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure

No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying

pressure to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient. r. de"

tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster charge of-...

fairiy sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this i

turn detonates the main charge. In military use INT is by far L'e

most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

So called "plastic explosive" or "Composition C-3" contains ig..::

percent RDX and 22% plasticizer made up of mixture of dinitrotolum;

INI, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrimethy-

lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethrlen.?o.

tetramine (which is obtained by the reaction of formaldehyde and

ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually totryl or PEIN,

Common explosives used in primers are lead azide, lead styphnate

or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate. Characteris-

tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a

trip wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed

above the ground.

The weight of a man stepping on the bullet

releases the trigger and fires the

cartridge which will penetrate

well up into the leg or the body,:

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a match on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No. I shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing

device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with

a gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction devica can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin of heavy

cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

. •

...

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

THERMAL IGNITORS. In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer) "

can be used as a trigger mechanism. For example In World War II .

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement shan

back together with hidden charges that would ignite when

a fire

was built. A simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a

hollow log by a burned out fire would, of course, explode 1f the

log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal

oil lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person

who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

to death.

CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used

in

the

construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

shows an Italian chemical delay Igniter. The upper chamber

contains acetone. When the piercing pin is pushed downward it

penetrates the lead disc and allows the acetone to flow into the

lower chamber.

The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid

washer which holds back the striker.

The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker

rod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker

is held back by a thin metal wire which is gradually dissolved

when a solution of acid is allowed to surround.it.

Other types of delay mechanisms may be constructed where a

liquid is allowed to drop through a small hole into a lower con-

tainer having a reactive substance attached part way up one wall.

The liquid level in the chamber gradually raises until it comes

In contact with the reactive substance which is the igniter.

One

suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture

of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable

combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for

the solid. There are many other combinations which a chemist might

improvise

from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used

as trigger mechanisms. Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from

ordinary household ammonia and iodine crystals. If the iodine

crystals are not available they can be obtained by evaporating

sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

Place two or three teaspoons of iodine crystals in a piece

of kleenex and wet thoroughly with strong ammonia solution. A

small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making

certain that it does not have the chance to dry out.

After three

or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and

partly evaporated from the lodine it can be left to dry out. While

wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,

it is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It

may be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet

away or a door being closed in the same building. The amount

described above will produce a violent explosion and should be

treated with extreme caution.

Several similar compounds will be

mentioned in the chapter on explosives.

One or two teaspoonsful of mercury fulminate of silver

fulminate mixed (very gently) with ten percent coarse sand can

be placed in a small packet of paper and attached to the upper

side of an automobile tire with adhesive tape.

When the tire rolls

over it the fulminate will explode with sufficient power to destroy

even a husky truck tire. These combinations also are very danger

ous to handle.

READY MADE BOOBY TRAP'S

All national armies are supplied with a variety of

manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used

specifically as booby trap material.

Most firing devices

are threaded on one end with

a standing size that allows them to

be used

either with prepared charges or with improvised charges

made from mortar or artillery shells.

Figure No. 9 shows a

simple firing device attached

to

a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in

Figure No. 10. The apparatus

at the left side is a trigger

mechanism that can be operated by a trip wire.

When it is fired

the flash

passes through the "y" tube which propels a 60mm

grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground

to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of

mine is 5-1/2 pounds.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

mortar shells in denolition work by placing them in a large

pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around them until they exploded. For booby traps use, however,

the projectile of an

artillery shell is the only part of any

value.

Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm,

In

those artillery shells where the prjectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.

Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base.

For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed and a standard firing device (M10 Universal destructor)

put in its place.

IMPROVISED BOOBY TRAPS

Standard hand grenades can be used alone in booby traps

in a number of methods. The simplest is to carefully remove

the handle and wedge the grenade between two heavy objects

strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with

just the safety pin ring sticking out. After the mud has hardened,

it will hold the handle in place and

the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn.

These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile

tire which will relcase the handle and fire the grenade.

A similar

trick is to place grenades in giass jars tight enough to hold the

handle in place when the safety pins

are withdrawn.

At night these

may be strung on a wire across a Inad and may not be seen by a

car traveling at night with its lights off. When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and

they soon explode.

It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity will ever be

exhausted when it comes

to improvising traps of various types.

A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi-

dual as an atomic bomb. Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes

ai the bottom, covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese' in World

War II.

"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a

victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still

be useful in guerrilla warfare.

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.

Alcoholic drinks are

easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary

type antifreeze) equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol

without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause

blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily

poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at

the rate of 2 ounces per bottle.

This dose is usually fatal

and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote.

• When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will

either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in

the open.

A new idea might be to put three

or four tablespoonsful

of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-

aretre ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of

commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would

actually explode if usea in this way.

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of booby traps favors an army.in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

For most efficient use the laying of booby traps cust be done in

a planned and coordinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in such a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties.

Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are

preferied to a few large ones.

Two or more triggers may be

autached to a single charge.

Variety of types and settings is

essential to effective use of booby traps in laige numbers.

in the event that triendly troops or your own personnel

may re-enter such an area later on, it is desirable that a written

record and detailed maps be kept as to where boody traps are

placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby

trapped they mark it with a sign which consists of a red triangle

pointed downunid with a white circle in the middle and the word.

booby traps painted in white across the top.

When anti-vehicle mines are placed by regular army forces

it is common practice to booby trap the mines so they will ex-

plode when being removed by personnel attempting to clear the

area.

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to boch guerrilla

and counter-guerrilla

activily, Guerrilla wariare involves two

basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas

ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use

of the booby traps.

In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot

they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have

placed to protect their

fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.

Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions

behind.

Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek

cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-

tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby

traps.

When regular army forces are being harrassed by guerrillas

they may be expected

to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas

in slightly protected warehouses

as traps.

These

supplies may be

heavily booby trapped

and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting

a short distance away to take pursuit. To guard against these

things,

the guerrilla should attempt to keep their

target under

surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel.

If

the enemy is very careful to always. come and go by the same route

it may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies

are not added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate that

they are being used to bait a trap.

By scouting the general area

guerrilla forces should guard against surprise by other enemy

forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush, guerrilla forces

should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real

booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be

safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations

and take just as much time doing so as if they were real. If the

enemy becomes carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will

run the danger of getting killed by a live one. In planning the

path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate

routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.
