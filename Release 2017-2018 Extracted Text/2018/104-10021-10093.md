It was confirmed that he had come to Mexico to obtain a visa
from the Cuban Embassy to transit Cuba enroute to Moscow.

In this connection he made contact with Silvia Tirado De DURAN,
Mexican, (Silvia DURAN) with whom he met on two occasions since she is
the Consulate employee in charge of carrying out the necessary procedures
for this type of visa and filling out the cards with data about the requester,
an essential requirement to obtain a Cuban visa.

By direction from her, he contacted the Russian Consulate for
the same purpose. On learning that Silvia DURAN has been one of the
contacts Lee Harvey OSWALD made in Mexico, this woman and her husband,
Horacio DURAN Navarro, were detained for interrogation. They made the
following declarations:

10. With respect to the attempt on President Kennedy, when she
heard the news she became depressed and thought that the author was
some maniac and when shé knew that it was an element of ''The Fair
Play for Cuba", she did not bdieve it at first. During President Kennedy's
visit to Mexico, she did not attend any of the functions that were held in
his honor and did not otherwise participate. In talking with her husband
when they leamed of the assassination she said it could have been done by
radicals and when Lee Harvey OSWALD entered Into the discussion, she
recognized him as the same person that had come to the Cuban Consulate
about two months prevtous to request a transit visa to Russia.

11, She remembered his name because of his unusual characteristics
and the circumstances of his visit L.e., he was married to a Russian and
sald he belonged to the "Falr Play for Cuba"; that she checked his data in
the Consulate's archives and she was then sure that it was the same person.
That he ts blond, short, poorly dressed, that his face gets red when he
talks; that he was denled a visa because the Consul told him that in order
to obtain one he would first need a visa from the Russian Consulate and this
procedure would take about four months and urged OSWALD to leave
Mexico. OSWALD became angry and for this reason she had to call the
Consul with whom he had an argument. That OSWALD was told that the
aid which could be given to him was to advise him to go to the Russian Con-
sulate. The Consul then spoke by telephone to the person In charge of that
office, and wag informed that the case would have to be referred to Moscow
and that there would be a four month delay. That in the afternoon of the
same day Lee Harvey OSWALD returned to the Cuban Consulate and that
she confirmed that he would only be given a visa when he had one fram the
Rugsian Consulate giving him, on a plece of paper, her name Silvia DURAN
with the office telephone number but that OSWALD was not given her address
since he had no reason to have it. That it was not her place to telephone
the Russian Consulate and If she did it was in an official form and to help
Lee OSWALD In the interest of performing her duties. That if she gave
him her telephone number It wae so that he could later ask If the visa had
been obtained, but he never called again.

12. It should be mentloned that in the home at which the DURANS
were detained, Herodoto No, 14, Dept. "A", house of the brother-in-law
