Coordination with involved components usually does occur
but generally not in accord with a common standard, except |

THE WASHINGTON POST 03 December 1992

‘at Moynihan has a candidate he is

pushing for Bill Clinton’s

consideration for CIA director:
Nobody,

‘The Democratic senator from New
York hinted at his choice in a report he
sent to the president-elect about
Bosnia, which he visited over
Thanksgiving. Yugoslavia is another
former country that Moynihan thinks
the agency misread— by completely
missing the ethnic ferocity that is
causing slaughter and famine.

He wants the agency shut down and
its functions folded into the State
Department, not just because it was a
creation of the Cold War that has
outlived what little usefulness he thinks
it had. It is because on the central
{question of the Cold War era, the
‘spooks got it dead wrong and caused us
to misspend ourselves into bankruptcy
competing with a pauper nation,

Moynihan may have a better chance of
convincing Bill Clinton to trim CIA and
‘stuff it into State than he has of
convincing his colleagues in the Senate,
His recent attempt to give a semblance
‘of democracy to the secrets factory—he
‘wanted to publish its budget—lost badly,
Democrats have not yet cast out their
fear of seeming “soft” on national
security; and Republicans, who hate all

become passionately protective when
cloak and dagger are in danger. Clinton,
at least, is anxious to save money. “He
could get about $5 billion if he closed it
down,” says Moyhnihan, “and not a drop
‘of blood on the floor.

Some senators, notably the current
chairman ofthe inteligene eommitee,

Bovi boren Ota) caren

Believes thatthe CIA i serious about
“reform.” He lobbied vigorously for the
confirmation of the present director,
Robert M. Gates, from an almost
childlike conviction that Gates wished to
democratize the agency and would
confide in his so-called overseers in
Congress. “I know," Boren would say to
doubters, “because he has told us s0
much, even things he didn't have to tell

us”
Recently, Boren has undergone a
conversion. Gates failed to share his.
information about the Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro, the state-owned Itafian
giant and its little Atlanta branch, that
provided the funds for loans to Iraq, and
the burgeoning scandal about our
generous financing of Saddam Hussein's
‘war machine. As it happened, the CIA

[Lee MARY MecRoRY [—)}
Terminating the CIA

got it right about what was going on in
Rome, but when challenged by the
Justice Department, which is
prosecuting on different theory, it
obligingly revised its information and
did not tell all it knew to a federal
judge. Boren has now joined in the hue
and cry for an independent counsel,
But Moynihan does not discuss such
poe esions when be presses hi ea
dl

someone who thwarts its purpose. He
does not recite the catalogue of crimes
committed by the agency when it was
being identified in the late Sen. Frank
‘Church's 1976 exposé as “a rogue
elephant.” The forbidden doimestic spying
during Watergate, the infamous LSD
experiments on unwitting subjects, the
subversion of the Chilean government,
the assassinations, to some Americans
hardly reflect our values.

Moynihan, the most scholarly”
senator, is a social scientist, and he
kknows about taking the measurements
that the agency got so wrong for so
Jong. In 1979, without the aid of
satellites or any other sophisticated
intelligence-gathering equipment, he
figured out that the Soviet Union was
headed for extinction.

He credits a “modest” employee of the

sus Bureau, one Murray Feshbach,
who in a forest of statistics found the
‘tree that mattered: the life expectancy
for Soviet males was dropping. This
should not be happening in a country
whose growth rate was routinely cited by
CIA as on a par with that of Italy and
Japan, In one of their most egregious
bloopers, they figured thatthe per capita
income in East Germany was higher than
‘West Germany's.

“The agency was so wedded to the
notion of the Soviet Union as a
successful state, that they couldn’t
absorb other ideas or realities,”
‘Moynihan says.

Stansfield Turner, Jimmy Carter's
CIA director, has admitted the hugely
wrong. estimates; but Gates and the
others now in charge are incapable of
saving "Boy, id we ever get it wrong.”
Moynihan notes “revisionist rum!
from Langley tothe effect that they had
it right all along. It has to have been
their best-kept secret,

‘Why does Congress put up with such
uinously expensive incompetence and,
year after year, increas the CIA's
secret budget?

Moynihan sighs, “It's the cachet on
knowing things that other people don’t
know—even when they're wrong.”
