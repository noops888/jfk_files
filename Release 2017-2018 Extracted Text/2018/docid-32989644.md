On August 27, 1975, SA Keith Mendenhall, Intelligence

Division, currently assigned the Senstudy Project, contacted

SAs Hawkins and Sheer and advised that the Church Committee,

U. S. Senate, had requested all the files which relate to.

the Camden Action during August, 1971.

Camden Action involved the case where 28 subjects

were arrested in the process of burglarizing the United States

Post Office and FBI Resident Agency of Camden, New Jersey,

8/21-22/71. Our arrests of these subjects was based on

information from a Philadelphia source, who was developed

immediately after Media, Pennsylvania, and who remained with

the radical

group which

eventually was apprehended in Camden.

SA Mendenhall requested that the file be reviewed

and only office informant symbol numbers be covered so as

not to divulge that particular field office number.

However,

all other confidential source and informant information on

all cover pages were to be left intact.

The request was for

all of the material which led to the decision to effect the

arrests of the subjects in Camden Action, as well as reports.

Two Xerox copies of each report were made.

There are 45

reports, contained in 25.

sections, two teletypes, and two

memoranda. There are 73 sections in this file (52-94527),

and all were searched.

A determination was made that

Sections. 38 through 73 pertained to Camden Action, while

Sections

Sections. 38 and 72 are excluded since they could

found, and are still on "locate."

As to the avallability of an F SI representative during

concerning alleged 'abuses, " I have determined that such no longer

with such witnesses are essentially four: (1) information which identifies

third agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Witnesses may

be cautioned prior to interview concerning such problem areas and

seirain from furnishing the information pending consultation with Fat

Headquarters. This mocification is effective immediately.

I hope that you will bring this matter to the attention of

in light of conversations he had had with you on the subject of

the SSC's request pertaining to materials in the Kraft file, I

attached, for your easy reference, my memorandum of September o,

making of the request, and the disposition of any informa

tion received

Where the request arose out of litigation, we would appre

ciate the opportunity to review the entire litigation file.

Reference is made to FBI memorandum dated August 25,

1975, in response to an SSC request dated August 20, 1975g

for the last known addresses of several former FBI Special

In respect to former SA Paul Leslie Cox, we furnished

his address as 2101 Ingraham Street, Hyattsville, Maryland

files.

We have since determined that former SA Cox is

frequently in travel status and uses the following two

addresses which are of motor trailer courts. The first of

these addresses is primarily a miling address and the second

is of a place where he generally resides when in Florida.

can be ascertained precisely which information in FBI files

come from electronic surveillance of Di. King; however,

there exist

areas where documentation of the information

is not precise and no accurate determination can be made.

Therefore, no assurance can be given that portions of the

It is further noced that in response to a number

Dear MI. Attorney General:

F3F

ALL #FORMATION CONTAINED

REAS CASERA MIRA

ATE/002-00 BY

I would like to bring to your personal attention

a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to

establish the relevant facts with respect to one of the

areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inquiry.

pursuant to S. Res. 21.

I have been informed by the staff that numerous

materials

which have been requested during the past several

weeks which pertain to the roi's activities with respect to

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., have been withheld from the

Committee by the Department because of concern expressed

by Mr. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and

estate,

as to the appropriateness of the Department's

"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations

«monitored during electronic surveillances of Di. King.

Upon reviewing the lists of materials requested,

I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could

conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,

especially in view of the fact that our letters of request

have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-

cripts should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to

place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all.of

the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King

matters, with the limited exception a Dead

August 24 - 27, 1964 memoranda which pertain the 1964

Democratic National Convention, and 2) those cortions of any

other requested materials which actually summarize or quote

from conversations nonitorea during

any electronic surver

ance of DI. King•

agreement between the Department and the Committee which

I understand that the

that there will be no substantial burden in meeting the

COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES ON AUGUST 12 = 1975

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED EXCEP

WHERE SHOWNOTHERWISE

I met with James Kehoe at the offices of the FBI

at 12:45 P.M. John B. Hotis, Leon F. Schwartz and Paul V.

Daly were present. I was furnished a memorandum concerning

Kehoe's appearance before the Senate Select Committee, a copy

of which is attached. Mr. Kehoe and I were assured that. the

Director had waived the secrecy agreement wich respect to

Kehoe's testimony insofar. as it related to nail covers and

interception, and that the Department of Justice had approved

the furnishing of such testimony. Mr. Schwartz advised that

he would accompany us to the offices of the Committee and would

keep himself avallable in the event that his assistance was

required.

Kehoe, Schwartz and myself arrived at the Senate

Office Building at 1:55 P.M. We were met by Paul Wallach,

James Dick, and Thomas Dawson. Wallach and Dick were staff

counsel to the Committee; Dawson identified himself as being

to the office of Senator Huddleston where the interview took

place. Schwartz remained in an adjacent room. The interview

Kehoe identified

ne

agents in charge of the New York

Office during his tenure (LaPrade, Malone, Foster, Powers and

Schmidt) and his Immediate supervisor in the mid 1960's (Brandt).

Kehoe stated that he worked exclusively in counter intelligence

except for occasional manpower emergencies when he might be.

assigned other temporary duties.

Kehoe stated that all requests for mail covers were

forwarded through his

office to the Director in Washington and

that approval would be returned in the same manner. All com-

munications. from Washington came under the name of the Director.

Upon receipt of the approval, contact would be made with local

postal inspectors.

•Direct communications with postal inspectors might take

place, in special circumstances. For example, if a subject being

surveiled placed a letter in a mailbox, postal inspectors might

be requested to locate the letter and advise the name of the

addressee. No search warrant would be obtained under such cir

cumstances. Kehoe stated that all investigative. contacts with

the postal service were made with postal inspectors. Mall carriers

and other personnel were not contacted directly. The FBI main-

tains liason with the post office, but individual agents could

contact postal inspectors directly in certain matters connected

with their cases. Kehoe could not recall the names of the liason

men in the mid 1960's.

Kehoe stated that his first contact with the Committee

of the

•FBI in

connection with his appearance was with John Hotis.

Fe advised that the FBI had not furnished him with counsel and .

that Herbert Kantor was his

bersohral.counsel.

Kehoe stated that he

visited Kennedy Airport in con-

nection with his duties to observe arrivals and departures of

persons under surveillance, to conver with the resident agents,

and in connection with mail procedures. In 1959 Kehoe suggested

that a program to review outgoing foreign mail be initiated.

The

suggestion for the program was submitted to his supervisor and the

agent in charge forwarded the suggescion to the Director. He did

not recall how long the request was pending in Washington, but

stated that it was approved and continued for approximately four

year's.

Arrangements were made. with postal inspectors to have

postal employees deliver certain air mail to a room in the air

mail building where It was scanned by FBI agents. Letters to

specific addresses in certain cities as well as letters having

certain indicators on the outside of the envelope that implied

a Soviet Connection were withdrawn from the mail and brought

to the New York Office. Kehoe stated that the indicators

were received from a sensitive source

and could not be re-

vealed. He confirmed that there was good reason to believe

that the indicators

were accurate and the program subsequently

proved their validity. The program was given the acronym

designation "SAM Survey" and assigned a case file. The mall

that was scanned under this program included mail going to both

Eastern and Westem European countries. Kehoe stated that he

believed the program was s

although he is aare that atlapes sports had indicated shal

the program might have continued thereafter.

A separate program providing for the review of all

mail addressed to the Soviet establishments in New York was

conducted ai or about the same time as SAM. This project

received the designation "Z Coverage". To Kehoe's inowledge

the "z" project was not generic, but related specifically

to mail addressed to the Soviet mission to the United Nations..

an a come and

Kehoe did not know how the Z program was initiated but believed

that it too was terminated by the Director in the mid 1960's.

A third mall'

program designated "SUN Survey"

paralleled the other two programs during the early 1960's.

This program included scanning the mail addressed to all

Soviet personnel at a post office box reserved for the United

Nations. This mail included soviet citizens working at the

United Nations other than in the Soviet United Nations mission.

Kehoe stated that he was not aware of any other mail intercept

progran Involving the soviets he stated further that he would

have no knowledge as to whether any other mail intercept programs

existed with respect to non-soviet matters. Kehoe said that •

he did not know the members of the China squad and that he had

not heard of the Hawailan Project. Kehoe said that he partici

pated in SAM and SUN but not in Z. If a project originated out

of the New York Office of was conducted by 1t, it would be un-

likely that the SAC would not have knowledge of 1fn

Kehoe stated that

the mayla write a memorandum of his

appearance before the Committee and submit It to the FBI. I stated

that the FBI had made no request for.my notes. Kehoe said that

he was not aware of any ongoing nail projects other than mail

covers used in

connection with specific cases.

Kenoe said that in the mid 1960's the SAC was Joseph

Schmidt and his supervisor was Arnold Brandt. His

squad was

designated by a letter of a number which did not have reference

to its function in soviet counter intelligence. The squad designa-

tion changed from time to time "as a football defense adjusts to

counter the offense".

Kehoe could not recall his first meeting with postal

Irspectors in connection with the SAM survey: Kehoe said that

he knew the postal inspector in charge but did not recall

whether

he discussed the SAM survey with him.. If. the postal inspector

In charge was present at such meeting then Kehoe believes that he

would have been accompanied by Schmidt. The FBI Informed the

pustal inspectors that they wished to review outgoing mail

• at Kennedy Airport addressed to certain European countries.

The review of themall was completed before the flight out so

that there was no delay.. A list of known Soviet mail drops

was created. and used for this purpose.: Kehoe's entire squad

worked on the project at various times. The special indicators

were. looked for. on a random sample basis in the mail to various

European cities. The selection of which cities' mail would be

reviewed depended upon flight schedule and manpower availability:

Kehoe was introduced to

a post office employee

at kennedy AIrport by a post

allinspector. Kehoe visited

Kennedy about five times while the project was being set up.

• He did not participate in the actual scanning of mall there-

after. When the mail was delivered to the room designateds

the postal employees

left. No postal employee was present

when the mail was scanned. Kehoe believed that

a subsection

supervisor, James O'Brien, assigned the personnel to scan

the mail. Kehoe said the name Orenstein was famillar and might

have been one of the names of the postal employees who worked

at Kennedy Airport.

Mail addressed to the addresses on the watch list.

or bearing the indicators was opened by. steam, the contents

photographed, then replaced, returned to kennedy Alrport and put

on the next flight together with other mall.. Inspection fox

microdots was undertaken, but lab tests were not performed for

other secret writing as it.would destroy the letter. The pro-

gram was conducted at Kennedy Airport only. It was pursued

around the clock, seven days a week.

It was keyed to specifically

known Soviet mail drops and indicators and was not based on the

sender.

Kehoe stated that he had read the Rockefeller Committee

report concerning the CIA mail program. He stated that the

differences in the programs between the CIA and FBI may have

been due to the

differing functions of the agencies. Kehoe

stated that he was not aware as to whether information was

exchanged with the CIA and that he did not meet with Mr. Papich.

Kehoe said that not more than three or four men at

a time were assigned to review the mail. Special skills and

and language were not regEthe Identifled as members of

his squad in the 1960's Francis Zangle, Bob Fieldhouse, James

McCarthy, Ray Wirth, Mike Moffft, and Richard McCarthy.

Kehoe stated that he was not in contact with the

• GIA during the early 1960's. He had only occasional contact

after liason between the two agencies broke down.

Kehoe stated. that the SAM Survey probably opened

fewer than 100 letters. If one letter bearing special in-

dicators was located within a six-month period, it was as

much as

could be expected. Ordinary surface mail and

registered mail were not a part of the program. The letters

were photographed in the same manner as the & cover letters.

Kehoe stated that the room at kennedy Airport did not contain

a telephone and was not visited by anyone from Washington. Kehoe

said

that schmidt did not visit the room. No. record of the

mail reviewed was made in the room and no photographic equipment

was present there.. A letter was either withdrawn from the mail

and taken to the New York Office or put back into the mail

-without notation. From time to time additions to the watch

IIst were forwarded from Washington. Kehoe stated that he did

not know of his own knowledge but assumed that such additions

may have come from the CIA.

Kehoe said that no cover story was developed in

anticipation that the program might be exposed.

The question

of exposure had not been raised nor did the FBI have concern

for the postal office employees working in connection with the

program. The only concem.was that the soviet personnel might

discover the mail watch

and

change their method of operation.

Kehoe stated that the case

walte was re-assigned by him to

George Quinn, who is now deceased. He did not know who received

the assignment of the case after. Quinn.

When a letter containing indicators was opened and

photographed there was no general dissemination of information.

A case file was opened with reference to an illegal

• soviet.

through a mail

drop in a European city. . More. complete identifica-

tion was difficult since the letter was fictitious. False names

were used and the communication was clandestine. Washington was

Informed of the location of the letter but nothing more than an

acknowledgement would be returned.

Washington did not express any complaint with respect

to the man hours spent on the project. Kehoe assumed that

Washington personnel were Informed of the project on a "need to

know! basis.

Kehoe stated that the SAM survey was terminated

uy the Director as a policy decision not because of any specific

event with which he was famillar.. To his knowledge, the project

was never reinstated, although he had suggested privately, but

not officially, that he belleved 1t would have value if re

commenced.

SECKET,

Co-ordination with the CIA was never requested.

Xenoe

met several employees of the CIA from time to time but did not

recall their names.

Kehoe was not aware of any request that the

## Page 82

CIA made for bugs or break-ins eithei through the New York or

Washington Offices of their nichoe stated that he had no

direct knowledge with respect to break-ins into installations

of ather goverments including south American countries.

The SUN Survey was initiated by George Quinn..It

had procedures similar to the SAM survey: Lt was assigned a

room on one of the upper floors of the Grand Central postal

building. It was a natural extension of the Z coverage. It

reviewed several hundred pieces of mail a day. All such letters

were brought back to the FBI and photographed. One man was

assigned to this duty each day. at

the Grand Central post office.

Kehoe took his tur from time to time. Since the Grand Centrai

post office was nearby, It was less. time consuming than the

Kennedy Alrport project. The room assigned to the FBI was not

private and there were postal functions going on on the same

floor. Kehoe believed that the same postal service employee

was assigned to deliver the mail for scanning each day. Kehoe

did not discuss the mall projects with anyone outside the FBI.

Kehoe did not believe the project could not be functioning

taday in the Ner York Office without his being aware of it (S

Kehoe believed that worthwhile information was

derived from the mail projects. The SUN letters that were

photographed were not routinely sent to Washington as many

such letters were innocuous. Any letters to the Soviet

Mission to the United Nations would be photographed regardless

of the source. Kehoe had no knowledge of the names of any

prominent persons writing to

the Mission but stated that anyone

who did so would have had their letter photographed. Kehoe

believed that the soviets had a similar mail operation functionine

Kehoe did not know

frank. Fabarint or Robert Williams.

He was familiar with Robert Hickey and Robert Monroe postal in-

spectors, and Henry Montegue.

Mr. Wallach thanked Mr. Kehoe. for appearing and stated

that he thought he was most cooperative. The interview terminated

at 4:40 P.M.

I have detailed penciled notes of the interviews. in-

cluding which of the three questioners addressed their questions

to Kehoe. My notes are available in che event that further

details are required.

former Special Agent George Berley be made available for Staff

interview concerning surreptitious entries by Bureau personnel at

9:30 a.m., 9-10-75.

We have previously communicated with the Department

requesting that they consider holding interviews by the Senate Select

Committee in abeyance in the area of surreptitious entries since it is

under review by the Department for possible criminal misconduct by

Bureau personnel. Michael Shaheen, Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination for the Department, has advised us orally the Department

will not hold such interviews in abeyance but rather the Bureau should

allow such interviews to take place. Shaheen orally stated that Bureau

personnel, who are being interviewed in these areas, should receive a

very strong briefing of their Fifth Amendment rights prior to their inter-

view by the Senate Select Committee.

SA Berley has advised the Legal Counsel Division

that he

has been contacted by the Senate Select Committee concerning this interview.

He was given a general briefing concerning his rights by SA Paul V. Daly

of this Division and he is to arrive at the Legal Counsel Division for a

more detailed briefing prior to his interview. He will also be briefed

at that time by the Intelligence Division in other areas which he may

properly refuse to answer questions.

O SEP L15:

RECOMMENDATION:

That existing employment agreement concerning George

Berley be waived for purposes of this interview.

Honorable Phillip W. Buchen.

Counsel to the President

The white House

Washington, D. C. 20500

Dear Mir. Buchen:

This is in response to your request for our

views concerning the need for concolidation of the

various Congressional inquiries into the activities or

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other investi

gative agencies in the Department of Justice.

As you know, the nuber of Congressional

Comnittees expreasing legislative or oversight interest

in these agencies

has increased signiticantly in the past

• severel months.

In addicion to Select Committees in the

House and Senate, at least a half dozen other Coumittees

of Congress are presently inquiring into the activities of

these agencies.

It appears, for example, that oversight

responsibilities in the House over the FBI ase shared

the Subcomictees on Civi1

and Constitutional Mights;

Courts, Civil Libercies and the Administration oi Justice;

the Subconmittee on Government Intorration and Indi

vidual Rights.

We have also been invited to testify balore

the Subconmittee on Fostal Facilities, Mail and Labor

Managanont on mattero colating to the

interception of the

mails. Vagt anourts of infomation and docurents have

been provided thus far to the members and staff personnel

of several of these Cormittees, and brickings have beer

conducted on the nost sensitive operations of Government.

As a general rule, these Commitcees are staffed

by personnel who have

limited knowledge about the functiona

and responsibilities of the intelligence connunity.

In

an effort to provide the basic information needed for an

intelligent judyment in these

matters, ve

have conducted

a number of briefings for stax

members of these Cormittees.

co undermine the morale of its employees.

We have experienced considerable difficulty

establishing suidelines for these interviews and for the

Ievler or production of docucents in agency files.

After

some months o negotiations wich the Senate Select Councice,

we finally agreed upon certain procedures in these natters.

I seid that that roquired a value judgment, but

as far as my personal experience in the Los Angeles Division

wen concerned, I felt it had minimal impact though there was

never any ray to be certain that impoct individuel actions may

have had.

Mr. Seidel asked if infornation obtained through

electronic surveillances had ever beon uaed as the basis

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLICENCE ACTIVITIES: (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SA BY SSC

He again asked if information obtained from electronic

surveillances had been the basis for COINTELPRO action, and I

again responded that if possibly could have been the case in

the Seberg matter, but I was not sure, and I could recall no

other instance where 1t might have been.

Mx. Seidel asked me to explain the neture of the

feud between the BPP and the U. S: Organization, I generally

expleined that this conflict had preceded, my arrival in

. Los

Angeles and continued for some time thereafter.

I said that

the two orgenizations were competing for influence in the

black community and on college campuses and that some of this

competition had resulted in violence, including the shooting

deaths of two BPP leaders on the campus of the University of

California at los Angeles in 1969

Mr.

Seidel

asked 1fve had attenpted to encourage

that conflict through use of the COINTELPRO. I responded that

I could recall no proposals that originated in los Angeles that

were intended to increase the antagonism between the two

organizations:

He asked if cards stating "Karenge is impotent!

had originated in los Angeles. I replied that I knew such a

chin but ted not set tenge out of a

proposal I had submitted.

Ron Karenga had been an Informant for local or Federal

authorities, as had often been alleged.

I responded that I had

no infornation regarding that

Mr. Seidel asked if I had ever received any pressure

from Washington concerning the COITELPRO. I advised him that

I remembered nothing to that effect.

He asked if pressure had

been placed on Sen Francisco concerning the COINTELPRO, and I

responded that I had no information in that regard.

Mr. Seidel asked if the Informants in the Los Angeles

Division hed been good.

I simply responded that informants are

a "his and miss" proposition, and that sometimes they were

good and sometimes they weren't so good. Mr. Seidel stated he

understood that the informant coverage evellable to the

San Diego Division had been of such quality that it hed not been

necessary to make use of an electronde surveillance to cover

BPP activities.

stated that I didn't know anything about that.

Mr. Seidel then asked what other kinds of cases I

ves

assigned during that period I vas responsible for the

COINTELPRO.

I said thet the cases were generally of a BP?

orientation, but I also participated in non-BPP kidnap, extortion,

bank robbery, and Fugitive investigations and also handled

some fugitive cases lavolving BPP activists.

Mr. Seidel stated that he had no further specific

questions at this time because the Committee was not yet in

receipt of COINTELPRO documents, He said he would have

additionel questions for me in the future.

the fornal interview

concluded at 11:27 e.M.

From opproximately 11:27 a.m. until 12:00 Noon we

conversed regarding matters unrelated to the formal inquiry and

upon my deperture he asked if I would be out of town in the next

few weeks.

I responded that I-wes tentatively scheduled to be

out of town off and on between the middle of September and the

end of October.

I suggested that it he needed to contact ne in

the future he make necessary arrangements through Paul Daly of

the Office of Legal Counsel or through whatever eppropriate

chennels had been previously established.

telephonically advised that he had been

contacted by Martha Tally, Senate Select Committee StatI Member,

and was requested to make himself available for Staff interview

concerning the history of the Security Indices (Index) and the

Bureau's relationship to the Department concerning this matter.

Tally advised Bland

that they had been given a detailed briefing

concerning this matter by Assistant Director Wannall of the In-

telligence Division. Bland was advised that he had a right to

counsel during interview; however, the Bureau could not provide

him with private counsel.. He was also informed that there were

• certain areas to which he may properly refuse to answer any

questions.

Those areas are where responses might tend to

identify a confidential source, information concerning sensitive

investigative techniques, information derived from other Govern-

ment agencies, including

information from foreign intelligence

sources, and

any information the disclosure of which could

adversely affect ongoing investigations.

Bland advised that he would furnish a written state-

ment of information of this interview to Section Chief William O.

from his employment agreement he may be reached in Williamsburg,

Virginia, at telephone number 804-564-9477.

This

memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Policy Steering Group held at CIA Heacquarters on

8-27-75. In Ms. Colby's absence, the meeting was chaired

by Major General Jack E. Thomas (Ret.), Acting Deputy Associate

Director of the DCI for

attendance were Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President,

James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President,

Mitchell Rogovin, Special Counsel to the Director of Central

Intelligence, Michael E. Shaheen, the Department's Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Inspector John B. Hotis,

SA Leon

F. Schwartz and representatives of the State Department,

Department of the Treasury, Department of Defense, Office of

Management and Budget, and

the National Security

Agency.

The primary purpose of the meeting was. to discuss

current relations with the House Select Committee. Mr. Rogovin,

Special Counsel to the Director of Central Intelligence, said

he met earlier that day with A. Searle Field, Staff Director

of the House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities and

discussed several topics of interest to

the intelligence com-

munity.

Field said that starting on

9-17-75 the Committee

plans to hold additional public hearings using the same general

format as in the past. At the outset, the Committee will call

the people at the operational level, such as Assistant Directors.

The heads of the agencies will be isked to testify at the final

hearings held at the end of the year.

Rogovin said MI. Field expressed concern about the

possibility that some agencies were intimidating witnesses.

He

was referring to the arrargement whereby agency employees who

appear as witnesses are required to write nemoranda reporting

the substance of the interviews.

Field was primarily concerne

about voluntary witnesses, those

followed by the Senate Select Committee concerning abuse

interviews versus investigative interviews. Although it would

be possible to have an Agent present during the investigative

interview, he would be required to leave the room if there

was a discussion of abuse practices. This, of course, would

not prevent an individual fxom having counsel of his own

choice present during the interview.

Rogovin said his own view is that an agency can

supply counsel as long as the employee realizes that there is

a potential conflict of interest and that the counsel's first

allegiance is to the agency.

It was pointed out that the

Department of Justice

has taken the position that a potential

• conflict of interest prevented it from providing counsel

for

the employees during these interviews.

He was

told that

the Department of Justice is researching the question of

whether the Government can reimburse an employee who finds

it necessary to employ private counsel at his own deiense.

Rogovin said he felt that the Department's position was

Inconsistent with its participation in the lawsuits involving

Haldeman,

thrichman, Mitchell, et al., in

which the Department

is providing legal representation. Rogovin said he believed

an effort was underway to set up

a panel of attorneys in

Washington who might sepresent such employees as a public

service.

Rogovin said he had been advised that Edward Roder •

had recently been dismissed from his position as staff

investigator by

Mr. Field.

Field is now concerned that Roder

will return to

nis former job as a reporter for the "Baltimore

Sun" and "leak" information obtained in his capacity as staff

investigator. He asked Rogovin for advice on how he thought

the secrecy agreement signed by tue Committee staff members

could best be

in this case. Field asked to be advised

investigator asked a senior official of ClA who spoke with a

noticeable accent whether he had ever been a member of the

German Intelligence Service.

would not be furnished to him, since it is given very limited

dissemination even within the intelligence conmunity. Field -

said this position demonstrates a lack of trust toward the

Committee and its staff members and a failure to respect their

legislative mandate.

Rogovin said that is not the issue; rather

it is whether it is

wise to entrust all that sensitive informa-

tion to one person.

As a final item he said that Congressman Les Aspin

hd asked for a briefing on electronic surveillance practices.

Rogovin said Aspin is one of the brightest members on the

Committee and can be a leader in molding the opinion of the

Committee.

Wilderotter said we should not honor. Aspin's request

until we have some assurances that he will maintain the conti-

dentiality of such information.. He suggested that we "hold up

until the Committee has a better track record."

Rogovin then asked for comments from those in

attendance concerning a draft letter from Mr. Colby

as Director

of Central Intelligence to Congressman Pike concerning procedures

that would be followed with respect to

requests for documents

and interviews of witnesses (copy attached). Mr. William G.

Hyland, Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of

State, said that his Department will not provide a reading room

for Committee staif members, nor will they give a briei

description of documents belonging to another agency.

It was

suggested and agreed that the wording of the

draft letter will

be revised to eliminate any references to a "brief description"

of documents withheld for Third Agency clearances.

The question of the ultimate disposition of documents

and other materials furnished the Committee was raised once

Several of the attendees expressed serious concern

about the failure of the draft letter to take a firm position

on the need for a resolution of this issue. It was pointed out

that all of the ultimate safeguards and procedures would be to

no avail if such information was ultimately published or made

available to the other members of Congress without restriction.

Mx. Wilderotter suggested that we should refuse any further

cooperation until this matter is resolved. Mr. Buchen felt,

however, this was not a realistic position to take and instructed

Rogovin to alter the wording of the letter to strengthen the

demand that a prompt decision be made in this matter.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo

Re: HOUSTUDY, SENSTUDY - 75

• Mr. Hotis said that the list of sensitive categories

set out in the draft letter was not broad enough to meet the

Bureau's needs.

It was pointed

out, for example, that the

list did not extend to information the disclosure of which

In addition it was

noted that the agency was permitted to withhold names of

citizens or organizations only where it had "pledged" confi-

dentiality. Mr. Rogovin agreed to change the wording to

include persons or organizations with whom the agencies had

a confidential relationship. Mr. Buchen said that the letter

would not be sent

on behalf of the entire intelligence community.

He wanted to see

"how this would fly" and if it was successful

each agency could draft similar letters tailored to meet its

own needs.

It was also

agreed that the wording in the last

paragraph of page 2 of the letter dealing with deliberative

documents would be changed to insure that it would apply to all

documents involved in the executive decision-making processes.

At the close of the meeting Mr. Hotis expressed

grave concern over the growing number of Congressional Committees

exercising oversight responsibilities over the FBI. In addition

to the Select Committees

of both Houses, staff members of the

House Subcommittees on Civil and Constitutional Rights and

Government Information and Individual Rights have recently

contacted

present or former employees of the Bureau in an effort

to conduct interviews. We have also received requests from

the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties,

and the

Administration of Justice and the Subcommittee on Postal Facilities,

Mail and Labor Management for information on Bureau practices

regarding electronic surveillances and mail openings,

respectively.

Not only does this impose a severe administrative burden on the

Bureau, but it also increases the likelihood that sensitive

information furnished to these Committees will eventually be

compromised. Mx. Hotis said that shere was an urgent need Ior

consolidation of these Committees anc

suggested it would be

helpful if the Administration discussed such proposals with

leaders of Congress.

Mx. Buchen agreed and asked that a

letter be directed to him setting forth the problems, which

could seive as a basis for a memorandum to the President. He

said the President might discuss this matter at his next meeting

with joint leadership of the Congress.

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, later suggested to

On July 25th I left with you a packet of materials

concerning procedures that might be appropriate in

handling the variety of demands your committee will

be making upon the Agency in the months to come.

then we have. had a number of frank discussions regarding

security and other aspects of your Committee's

investigation.

In addition, the Committee's Staff

Director has held a series of discussions with our

Special Counsel and members of my staff.

With this

then

as bachground, let me suggest the adoption of certain

procedures that I believe will insure our ability to

respond promptly and fully

to the needs of the Coimittee.

• I. Documents:

Upon receipt of a written request for documents

dealing with a particular area of inquiry, the Agency will

promptly respond with an

answer, a partial response or

at-least a-statement as to when the materials will be

available.

To insure that there are no misunderstandings

as to the materials requested, I have encouraged our staff

to contact your staff members and discuss the precise

nature of any request not clear on its tace.

Further,

our staff has been instructed to make materials available

as soon as they are ready and not hold up a response

until all of the materials requested have been

compiled.

When documents are withheld because clearance is being

sought from another Agency, your committee will be notified.

and a brief description of the document will be given.

Finally, some proposed testimony and requests for

documents may enter the area nf the executive decision-

making process in which the need to protect the

confidentiality of advice or recommendations to policy-

making bodies has long been recognized. This would apply,

for example,

to Presidential or 10 Commitice deliberations

relating

approval of ciA actions.

Where such a

circumstance exists, we would-advise the Committee that

executiva approval is being sought and that we would be

in further touch with your staff on the matter.

We will want to work together, too,

to protect certain

other information which, it improperly disclosed, could impali

the legitimate rights of privacy of individuals.

I am sure

we can deal

with these matters so as to protect this essential

privacy while satisfying the Select Committee's need for a

full understanding of intelligence activities.

II.

Witnesses:

You doubtless will want to interview present and

•former CIA employees.

Current employees will, of course, be

made available to the Select Committee for staft interviews

and for testimony.

This on rare occasions may require

special arrangements, including testimony under alias,

protect the identity of employees whose safety or future

utility might be jeopardized by. exposure.

the interview of Agency employees who are currently on

detail to other agencies in the government and whose

testimony relates to CIA matters., we will arrange with the

host agency to make the employee available upon request of

Committee.

Where the employee is

sought to testily with

respect to matters concerning his detail or matters relating

to the host agency, we will bring your request to

attention of the host agency.

Thus, if your staff will advise

us of whom they wish to interview, we will make the

no auchority to direct the cooper on ye ex employees, to

appropriate arrangements with

While I have

will be happy to assist you in

any I can. In a very few

cases, their identities also will have to be protected.

As you know, each employee had to sign a security

agreement upon entering: on duty: -This requires that ne

keep forever secret all classified information gained

during his employment, unless he obtains prior authorization

• to disclose it trom the bel. These secrecy agreements

signed by oux employees and ex-employees need not impair

the necessary work of your Committee. In view of the

security protection contemplated by your committee.

I have determined that disclosure of otherwise protecte

information to teh Select Committee or its designated

staff members will, inmost instances, constitute a tully

authorized provision of information within the meaning

of the secrecy agreements.

This letter may be used to

He die

indicate authorization for any Agency employee to furnish

information to the Select Comnittee or to appropriate

staff members on matters which otherwise would be

covered by their secrecy agreement.

Where, however, the

answer to the particular question covers the highly

sensitive matters mentioned above, the employee or

former employee is obligated to consult with the Agency

before responding.

In this regard, the Agency should be

notified before the Committee contacts each Agency employee

or ex-employee who is to be interviewed or called to

testify.

I attach

a separate letter addressed to CIA

ex-employees which should be shown to them for the

same

purpose.

Since so many of our activities involve sensitive

areas, I propose a procedure which should aid the Committee

in expediting its investigation.

If the Committee will

notify Mitchell Rogovin, Special Counsel to the Director,

of the areas of its inquiry at the outset, we would be

in a position to highlight particularly sensitive issues

and work out nethods to insure that your Committee obtains

what it needs without unnecessary risk to the sensitive

matters.

We will then be in a position to advise the

Committee whether any particularly sensitive issues

may be involved: Such a procedure will insure you get

the information you need

to perform your task and at the

same time safeguard sensitive intelligence sources and

methods which-I am obligated by law to protect,

conclusion, we ask that your Committee make an

early determination as to the ultimate disposition of its

recoras upon completion of its tasks...

lam sure you

will join me in recognizing

that permanent, safe

storage

and security safeguards will be necessary to protect the

sensitivity of the Committee's records.

To this end you

may wish to discuss permanent disposition with the

Archivist of the United States.

: ":":

....:

It is in our mutual interests to ensure that your

review proceeds as smoothly and as expeditiously as

possible.

Toward that end, I have instructed all CIA

personnel to respond in a spirit of cooperation.

A

COpy Of

that instruction is attached. And, I am prepared

to consult with the Committee

at any time tò determine

appropriate courses of action:

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby

August 29, 1975, with this comminication.

Item 2 of the request inguired concerning a

"'librazy" of handout"' material maintained by "the New left

Reporting Unit" in 1970. The teru "library"" has been used

by this Bureau to describe such naterial in a general sense.

No fornal, permanent, cataloged collection of material has

existed.

Rather, it has been the practice of supervisors

handling 'New left'' matters to maintain in their office

space coples of material which came to their attention in

the course of their duties and which might be of value in

quickly responding to requests for, or inquiries concerning,

such materiel.

This practice contimes. The raterial consists

of both classified and unclassified documents, such as

articles by former Director J. Edgar Hoover, as well as

newspaper clippings, magazine articles and pamphlets.

No

formal record has been maintained of the materials on hand

at any particular date. Neither was any centralized, formal

record made of the recipients to won raterials were furnished

or what materials were furnished. The current collection of

such material is available for review by SSC Staff Members

In Research. Wallach, Dick, Dawson, Kehoe and I proceeded

to the office

of Senator Huddleston where the interview took

place. Schwartz remained in an adjacent room. The interview

proceeded as follows:..

James Dick initiated the questioning. Kehoe stated

that he was' assigned to counter intelligence for approximately

22 years. His squad was concerned with soviet espionage activities

in the United States

Kehoe identified the agents in charge of the New York

Office during his tenure (LaPrade, Malone, Foster, Powers and

Schmidt) and his immediate supervisor in

the mid 1960's (Brandt).

Kehoe stated that he worked exclusively in counter intelligence

except for occasional manpower emergencies when he might be

assigned other temporary duties.

Kehoe stated that all requests for mail covers were

forwarded through his

office to the Director in Washington and

that approval would be returned in the same manner. All com-

munications from Washington. came under the name of the Director.

Upon receipt of the approval, contact would be made with local

postal inspectors.

Direct. communications with postal inspectors might take

place, In special circumstances: For example, if a subject being

surveiled placed a letter in a mailbox, postal inspectors mignt

be requested to locate the letter and advise the name of the

addressee. No search warrant would be obtained under such cir

.• cumstances. Kehoe stated that all investigative. contacts with

the postal service were made with postal inspectors. Mail carrier

and other personnel were not contacted directly. The FBI main-

tains liason with the post office, but individual agents could

contact postal inspectors directly in certain matters

connected

with their cases. Kehoe could not recall the names of the liason

men in the mid 1960's.

visited Kennedy

Airport in con-

nection with his duties to observe arrivals and

departures of

persons under surveillance, to conver with the resident agents,

and in connection with mail procedures. In 1959. Kehoe suggested

that a program to review outgoing foreign. mail be initiated. The

suggestion for the program was submitted to his supervisor and the

agent In charge forwarded the suggestion to the Director. He

d1d

not recall how long the request was pending in Washington, but

stated that it was approved and continued for approximately four

jear's.

Arrangements were made. with postal inspectors to have

postal employees deliver certain air mail to a room in the air

mail building where it was scanned by FBI agents. Letters to

specific addresses in certain cities as well as letters having

certain indicators on the outside of the envelope that implied

a Soviet Connection were withdrawn from the

mail and brought

to the New York Office. Kehoe stated that the indicators

were received from a sensitive source

and could not be re-

vealed. He confirmed that there was good reason to believe

that the indicators were accurate and the program subsequently

proved their validity. The program was given the acronym

designation "SAM Survey" and assigned a case file.

The nail

that was scanned under this program included mail going to both

Eastern and Westem European countries. Kehoe stated that ha

believed the program was terminated by the Director in 1963,

NW 55171 DocId: 38989644 Page 180

although he is aware that newspaper reports had indicated that

the program might have continued thereafter.

A separate program providing for the reviar of all

mall addressed to the Soviet establishments in New York was

conducted at or about the same time as

SAM. This project

received the designation "Z Coverage". To Kehoets inowledge -

the "z" project was not generic, but related specifically

to mail addressed to the soviet mission to the United Nations..

Kehoe did not know how the Z program was initiated but believed

that It too was terminated by the Director in the

mid 1960's.

A third mail program designated "SUN Survey"

paralleled the other two programs during the early 1960's.

This program inciudd seanning the mall addressed to all

Soviet personnel at a post office box reserved for the United

•Nations.

This mail included soviet citizens working at the

United Nations other than in the Soviet United Nations mission.

Kehoe stated that he was not aware of any other mall intercept

program lavoluing the soviets he stated further that he would

have no knowledge as to whether any other mail intercept programs

existed with respect to non-soviet matters. Kehoe said that

he did not know the members of the China squad and that he had

not heard of the Hawaiian Project. Kehoe said that he partici-

pated in SAM and SUN but not in i.. If a project originated out

of the New turk Office or was conducted by it, It would be un-

likely that the SAC would not have knowledge of 1t

Kehoe stated that he would write a memorandum. of his

appearance before the Committee and submit it to the FBI. I state

that the FBI had made no requesto

or. my notes. Kehoe said that

he was not aware of any ongoing mail projects other than mail

covers used in connection with specific cases.

Kenoe said that in the mid 1960's the SAC was Joseph

Schmidt and his supervisor was: Arnold Brandt. His squad was

designated by a letter of a number which did not have reference

to its function in Soviet counter intelligence. The squad designa

tion changed from time to time "as a football defense adjusts"to

counter the offense"

Kehoe could not recall his first meeting with postal

Irispectors in connection with the SAM survey: kenue said that.

he knew the postal inspector in charge but did not recall whether

he discussed the SAM survey with him.. If the postal inspector

"In charge was present at such meeting then Kehoe belleves that he

would have been accompanied by Schmidt. The FBI Informed the

postal inspectors that they wished to review outgoing mail

at Kennedy Airport addressed to certain European countries.

The review of themail was completed before the flight out so

that there was no delay:. A list of known Soviet mall drops

was created. and used for this purpose. Kehoe's entire squad

worked on the project at various times. The special indicators

were looked for. on a random sample basis in the mall to various

European cities. The

selection of which cities.' mail would be

reviewed depended upon flight schedule and manpower avallability.

office employee

at Kennedy Alrport by a postal inspector. Kehoe visited

Kennedy about five times while the project was being set up.

He old not participate a chaudedual seanning of mall thera-

after. When the mail was delivered to the room designated,

the postal employees left. No postal employee was present

when the mail was

scanned. Kehoe believed that a sub-section

supervisor, James O'Brien, assigned the personnel to scan

the mail. Kehoe said the name Orenstein was familiar and might

have been one of the names of the postal employees who worked

at Kennedy Airport.

or bearing the indicators was opened by steam, the contents

photographed, then replaced, returned to Kennedy Airport and put

on the next flight together with other mail..

Inspection for

microdots was undertaken, but lab tests were not performed for

other secret wilting as it. would destroy the letter. The pro-

gram was conducted at Kennedy Airport only. It was pursued

around the clock, seven days a week. It was keyed to specifical

known Soviet mail drops and indicators and was not based on the

sender.

Kehoe stated that he had read the Rockefeller Committee

report concerning the CIA mail program.. He stated that the

differences in the programs between the CIA and FBI

may have

been. due to the

differing functions of the agencies. Kehoe

stated that he was not aware as to whether information was

exchanged with the CIA and that he did not meet with Mr. Papich.

as members of

his squad in the 1960's Francis Zangle, Bob Fleldhouse, James

McCarthy, Ray Wirth, Mike

Morris, and Richard MoCarthy.

Kehoe stated that he was not in contact with the

CIA during the early I960's. He had only occasional contact

after liason between the two agencies broke down.

Kehoe stated. that the SAM Survey probably opened

fewer than 100 letters. •If one letter bearing special in-

dicators was located within a six-month period, it was as

much as could be expected. Ordinary surface mail and

registered mail were not a part of the program. The letters

were photographed in the same manner as the & cover

•jetters.

Kehoe stated that the

, room at kennedy Airport did not contain

a telephone and was not visited by

anyone from Washington. Keho

said

that Schmidt did not visit the room. No record of the

mail reviewed was made in the room and no photographic equipment

was present there.. A letter was either withdrain from the mail

and taken to the New York Office or put back into the mail

-without notation. From time to time additions to the watch

Ilst were forwarded from Washington. Kehoe stated that he did

not know of his own knowledge but assumed that such additions

may have come from the CIA.

Kehoe said that no cover story was developed in

anticipation that the program might be exposed.

The question

of exposure had not been raised nor did the FBI have concem

Kehoe stated that the case file was re-assigned by him to

George Quinn, who is now deceased.: He did not know who received

the assignment of the case after. Quinn.

•When a letter containing indicators was opened and

photographed there was no general dissemination of Information.

A case file was opened with reference to an illegal soviet.

tion was difficult since the letter was fictitious. False names

were used and the communication was clandestine. Washington was

Informed of the location of the letter but nothing more than an

acknowledgement would be returned.

Washington did not express any complaint with respect

to the

man hours spent on the project. Kehoe assumed that

Washington personnel were informed of the project on a "need to

know! basis.

Kehoe stated that the SAM survey was terminated

by the Director as a policy decision not because of any specific

event with which he was famillar... To his knowledge, the project

was never reinstated, although he had suggested privately, but

not officially, that he believed It would have value 1f re-

commenced.

Co-ordination with the CIA was never requested.

Kehoe

met several employees of the CIA from time to time but did not

recall their names. Kehoe gas: not, aware of any request that the

Kehoe stated that he had no

arrect knowledge with reapedd

installations

of other govemments including south Anerican countries.

The Sun survey was initiated by George Quinn. It

had procedures similar to the SAM Survey. (It was assigned a

• room on one of the upper floors of the Grand Central

postal

building. It was a natural extension of the Z coverage. jIt

reviewed several hundred pieces of mail a day. All such letters

were brought back to the FBI and photographed. One man was

assigned to this duty each day at the Grand Central post office.

Kenoe took his tum from time to time. Since the Grand Central

poss office, was nearby, It was less time consuming than the

Kennedy Airport project. The room assigned to the FBI was not

private and there were postal functions going on on the same

floor. Kehoe believed that the same postal service employee

was assigred to dellver the mail for scanning each day. Kehoe
