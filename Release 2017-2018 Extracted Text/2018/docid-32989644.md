the radical group which eventually was apprehended in Camden.

SA Mendenhall requested that the file be reviewed
and only office informant symbol numbers be covered so as
not to divulge that particular field office number. However,
all other confidential source and informant information on
all cover pages were to. be left intact. The request was for
all of the material which led to the decision ,to effect the
arrests. of the subjects. in Camden Action, as well as reports. we

reports, contained in 25 sections, two teletypes, and two.
memoranda. There are 73 sections in this file (52-94527),

With respect to the cases involving litigation beyond the
immediate vicinity of the District of Columbia, we would appreciate
your initially identifying the attorney handling the matter in order

: Senate Select Committee Request: Joseph Kraft

This memorandum will confirm a telephone conversation had
this morning with Jack Fuller, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, on the above-captioned request. Mr. Fuller advised that
in light of conversations he had had’with you on the subject of
the SSC's request pertaining to materials in the Kraft file, I
should forward that request to you in writing for the Bureau's V
appropriate response. —_—

The SSC's request for Kraft materials is contained on
page 3 of the attachment to John Elliff's letter dated July 28,
to former Special Counsel K. William O'Connor. Specifically,
it is request ITI.A. and asks for more than the SSC's "outstanding
previously requested materials" on the subject of Kraft. I have
attached, for your easy reference, my memorandum of September 8,
1975, to Jack Fuller, which contains the specific language of
the Committee's request. (You should already have a copy of
Elliff's letter of July 28, 1975, with attachments.)

" Dear Mr. Attorney General: DAT

I would like to bring to your peat attention
a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to
establish the relevant facts with respect. to one of the
areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inquiry.
pursuant to S. Res. 21.

_I have been informed by the staff that numerous
materials which have been requested during the past several
weeks which pertain to the rhi*s activities with respect to
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., have been withheld from the.
Committee by the Department because of concern expressed
by Mr. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and
estate, as to the appropriateness of the Department's
"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations
emonitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King.

‘ : Upon” reviewing the lists of materials requested,

I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could
conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,
especially in view of the fact that our letters of request
have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-
eripts should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to
place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all. of
the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King
Matters, with the limited exception of (1) Mr. DeHOa CHa
August 24 - 27, 1964 memoranda which pertain to 94
Democratic National Convention, and (2) those cortions of any
other requested materials which actua y_summarize or quote
from conversations-monitored uring any efecercnie surveili=
ance of Dr. King. i



Honorable Edward i@ Levi-
Page 2 4 :

a Delivery is requested by Wednesday, September 3,
1975, pursuant to the provisions of the general procedural
agreement between the Department and the Committee which
governs all Committee requests. JI understand that the
Bureau has been collecting the King-related materials upon .
receipt of each of our requests, and therefore I presume
that there will be no substantial burden in meeting the

September 3, date. : 7 7 ie ot

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

Pursuant to Section-TII. A. of the notification
attached to the Committee's letter of June 27, 1975, I am
forwarding herewith an additional-request for materials
which relate to this matter. :

ul The specificity of this request is not, of
course, intended to limit in any way the agreement to come
fdrward with all relevant information and materials, includ-
ing documents, whether or not they have been brought tc the
Committee's attention, or have been specifically requested

As Mr. Schwarz and I indicated in our “meeting
7 with you a few days ago, there are still outstanding sev-
eral items relating to this matter which the Committee re-
quested some time ago. This request should in no way delay
-further the availability of the previously requested items,
and we would expect that individual items will be supplied
whenever they become separately ready for submission.

Your cooperation is appreciated.

SUMMARY OF APPEARANCE WITH-JAMES KEHOE BEFORE SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES ON AUGUST 12, 1975

I met with James Kehoe at the offices of the FBI

at 12:45 P.M. John B. Hotis, Leon F. Schwartz and Paul V.

Daly were present. I was furnished a memorandum conceming

Kehoe's appearance before the Senate Select Committee, a copy ©

of which is attached, Mr. Kehoe and I were assured that. the

_ Director had waived the secrecy agreement with respect to
Kehoe's testimony insofar.as it related to nail covers and

interception, and that the Department of Justice had approved

the furnishing of such testimony. Mr. Schwartz advised that

he would ‘accompany us to the’ offices of the Commit tee and would

keep himself available in the event that his assistance was

required.
if Kehoe, Schwartz and myself arrived at the Senate

Office Building at 1:55 P.M. We-were met by Paul Wallach,

James Dick, and Thomas Dawson. Wallach and Dick were staff
counsel to the Committee; Dawson identified himself as being

in Research. Wallach, Dick, Dawson, Kehoe and I proceeded

to the office of Senator Huddleston where the interview took

place, Schwartz remained in an adjacent room. The interview

Bet proceeded as follows:

James Dick initiated the questioning. Kehoe -.ated

that he had been given no specific instructions from tho

Bureau as to how he was to testify. “He st ed that sa

eioeletieiah e cent e
that he “was assigned to counter intelligence for approximately

. 22 years. His squad was toncerned with Soviet espionage activities
in the United States wee ;

Kehoe sacinta trod B82 agents in charge of the New York

: office during his tenure (LaPrade, Malone,- Foster, Powers and
Schmidt) and his immediate supervisor in the mid 1960's (Brandt).
Kehoe stated that he worked exclusively in counter intelligence
except for occasional manpower emergencies when he might shi
assigned other temporary duties.

Kehoe stated that all requests for mail covers were
forwarded through his ‘office to the Director in Washington and
that approval would be returned in the same manner, All com-
mnund cations from Washington came under the name of the Director.
Upon receipt of the approval, contact would be made with local
postal inspectors. : :

. : ‘Direct. communications with postal inspectors might ‘take
place in special circumstances. ‘For example, if a subject being
surveiled placed a letter in a mailbox, postal inspectors might
be requested to locate the letter and advise the name of the
addressee. No search warrant would be obtained under such cir-
cumstances. Kehoe stated that all investigative contacts with ~
the postal service were made with postal inspectors. Mail carriers
and other personnel were not contacted directly. The FBI main-
tains liason with the post office, but individual agents ‘could
contact postal aneDe eons directly in certain natters connected
with their cases. Kehoe could not recall the names of the liason

men in the mid 1960's.

Kehoe stated that his first contact with the Committee

‘of the FBI in ee with his se was with gohn Hotis. |
_ advised that the FBI had not furnished him with counsel and. i
‘that Herbert Kantor was nae plead. counsel.

Kehoe stated that he visited Kennedy Airport in con-
nection with his duties to observe arrivals and departures of
persons under surveillance, to conver with: the resident agents,
and in connection with mail procedures. In 1959 Kehoe suggested
that a program to review outgoing foreign. mail be initiated. The
suggestion for the program was submitted to his supervisor and the
agent in charge forwarded the suggestion to the Director. He did
not recall how long the request was pending in Washington, but
stated that it was approved and continued for approximately pou
years, :
: ; Arrangements were made. with postal inspectors to have
postal employees deliver certain air mail to a room in the air
mail building where it-was scanned by FBI agents. Letters to
specific addresses in certain cities as well as letters having
certain indicators on the outside of the envelope that implied

a Soviet Connection were withdrawn from the mail and brougnt

to the New York Office. Kehoe stated that the indicators

were received from a sensitive source and could not be re-
vealed. He confirmed that there was good reason to believe :
that the indicators were accurate and the program subsequently
proved their validity. ” ‘The program was “given the acronym
designation "SAM Survey" and assigned a case file. The mail
that was scanned under this program included mail going to both
Eastern and Western European countries. Kehoe stated that he

believed the program was Sis ; by the Director in 1963,

Docid:32989644 Page 76

although he is aware thatgnguspaper reports had indicated that
the program mignt have odbttneea therearter. :

JOA separate program providing for the veview of all
mail addressed to the Soviet establishments in New York was
conducted at or about the same time as SAM. This project
received the designation "Z Coverage". To Kehoe'ts knowledge
the "Z" project was not generic, but related specifically
to mail addressed to the Soviet mission to the United Nations.
Kehoe did not know how the 2 program was initiated but believed
that it too was terminated by the Director in the mid 1960s.

A third mail program designated "SUN Survey"
paralleled the other two programs during the early 1960's.
4 [mnis program included scanning the mail addressed to all
Soviet personnel at-a post office box reserved for the United
Nations. . This’ mail ineluded Soviet citizens working at the
United Nations other than in the Soviet United Nations mission, .
‘Kehoe stated that he was not aware of any other mail intercept
program involving the Soviets. ie stated further that he would
“have no knowledge as to whether any other mail intercept programs
existed with respect to non-Soviet matters. Kehoe said that
he did not know the members of the China squad and that he had
not heard of the Hawaiian Project. Kehoe said that he partici=+
pated in SAM and SUN but not “in Z. Ifa project originated out
of the New York Office or was conducted by it, it would be un-

likely that the SAC would not have knowledge of iti, >

that the FBI had made no request for.my notes. Kehoe said that

: Kehoe said that inthe mid 1960%s the SAC was Joseph
Schmidt vend his supervisor was Arnold Brant His Squad was
designated by a letter or a number which’ ‘aia not have reference

to its function in Soviet counter intelligence. The squad ‘designa-

counter the offense",

Kehoe could not recall his ‘first meeting with postal

he knew the postal, inspector 4n- charge but did not recall whether
he discussed the SAM survey with him. _If. the ‘postal inspector
in charge was present at such meeting then Kehoe believes that he
would have been -accompanied by Schmidt. The “FBT informed the
postal inspectors that they wished to review outgoing mail

. at Kennedy Airport addressed to certain European countries.

The review of themail was completed before the flight out sO
‘that there was no delay.. A list of known Soviet mail drops

was created. and used for this purpose. : Kehoets entire squad
worked on the project at various times. The ‘special indicators

were.looked for.on a.random sample basis in the mail to various

| Kehoe was introduced ie a@ post office employee

Kennedy about five times while the project was being set up. f

7 He did not participate in the actual scanning of mail there-

- after. When the mail was delivered to the room designated,

TEE ; the postal employees ‘left. No postal employee was present
when the mail was scanned. Kehoe ‘believed that @ subusection
supervisor, James O'Brien, assimea the personnel to scan
the mail, Kehoe said, the name Orenstein was ‘familiar and might

- have been one of the names of the postal employees who worked
at Kennedy Airport. :

: Mail addressed to the addresses on the wateoh list,

“or bearing the indicators was opened by steam, the contents

" photographed, then replaced, returned to Kennedy Airport and put
Hn the next: flight together with other mail. Inspection for
wmicrodots was undertaken, but lab tests were not performed for
other secret writing as it. would destroy the letter. The pro-

- Spam was conducted at Kennedy Mrport only. It was pursued :
around the clock, seven days a week, ‘It was keyed to specifically
known Soviet mail’drops and indicators and was not based on the
sender.

‘Kehoe stated that he had read the Rockefeller Committee

report concerning the CIA mail program. | He stated that the
differences in the programs between the CIA and FBI may have
been: due to the differing functions of the agencies. Kehoe

adi cators was located within a six-month period, it was 7
much as could be expected, Ordinary surface mail and
registered mail were not @ part of the program. The letters
were photographed in the ‘same manner as the Z cover’ letters.
Kehoe stated that the room at Kennedy Airport did not contain
a telephone’ and was not Visited by anyone from Washington. Kehoe
: said that Schmidt did not visit the room, No record of the
mail reviewed was made in the room and no photographic equipment
was present there. .A letter was either withdraim from the mail
and taken to the New York Office or put back into the mail

list were forwarded from Washington. Kehoe stated that. he did
not know of his own knowledge but assumed that such additions

may have’ come from the CIA.

anticipation that the program might be exposed. The question

of exposure had not been raised nor did the FBI have concern

George Quinn, who is now deceased. “He did not know who received
the assignment of the case after Quinn.

When a letter containing indicators was opened and
photographed there was no general dissemination of information.
A case file was opened with reference to an illegal Soviet-
in the United States writing to his superior in the U.S.S.R.
through a mail drop in a European eity. . More. complete identifieca-
tion was difficult since the letter was fictitious. False names
were used and the communication was clandestine. Washington was
informed of ‘the location of the letter but nothing more than an

: acknowledgement would be returned.

Washington ‘dia not express any complaint with respect
‘to the man hours spent on the project. Kehoe assumed that
Washington personnel were. informed of the project on a "need to
know" basis. :

Kehoe stated that the SAM ‘survey was terminated . ~

floor. Kehoe believed that the same vostal service employee
was assigned to deliver the mail for scanning each day. Kehoe
did ‘not: discuss the mail projects with anyone outside the FBI.

: Kehoe believed that worthwhile information was

: derived from the mail projects. The SUN letters that were
photographed were not routinely sent to Washington-as many

such letters were innocuous. Any letters to the Soviet

Honorable Phillip W. Buchen
Counsel to the President
The White House

Washington, D. G. 20506

Bear Mr. Buchen:

This is im response to your request for our
views concerning the need for consolidation of the
various Congressional inqu wities of

7 the Federal Bureau cf Investigation and other investi-
gativa ‘agencies in the Department of Justice.

As you know, the nusber cf Congressional
Committees expressing legislative or oversight interest
im these agencies has Increased significantly in the past

-severel months. In addition te Select Commitraees in the
House and Senate, at Least a half dozen other Committees
of Congress are presently inquixing into the activities of
these agencies. It appears, for example, thet oversight
responsibilities im the House over the FBI are shared by
the Sube ttees on Civil and Constitutional B:
Courts, (Ll Liberties and the Admini
aad the Subc thee on Government
vidual Rights. We have alse been fore
the Subconmittee on Postal Facilities, Mail and Laber
Manaperent on watters celating to the interception cf the
mails. Vast amount mts have

Ents;
tration of Justice;
gration and Indi-

ed to testify bef

ts of information and docum
been provided thus far to the members and staff perscnnel
ef sevaral of these Govmittees, and briefings have been
conducted on the most sensitive operations c

As a general rule, these Committees are s
by personnel who have limited knowledge chout the function:
and cesponsibilities of the intelligence coum Ta
t to provide the basic information needed for an
ent judgment in these mattereg, we have conducted
a nunber of briefings for staS€ members of these Committees.

HWW 55171 DocTd:32989644

Honorable Phillip W. Buchen

Thie is a time-consuming process and ona which must be
repeated for each of the Committees. Additional problems
are created by the numerous interviews by Committee staffs -
of agency personne In some cases, these interviews
involve alleged improprieties or matters being reviewed

by this Department for possible prosecution. This places
the employee in a very diffievlt situation, partieularly
when he is called upon repestedly to justify his actions

to various Congressional investigatora. Net only does

thio discupt the normal routine of the agency, but it tends
to wuidexmine the morale of its employees.

We have experienced considerable difficulty
establishing guidelines for these interviews and for the
review or production of decuments in agency Flles. After
some months of negotiatlons with the Senate Seleet Ccameltree,
we finally agreed upon certain procedures in these matters.
it appears, however, these procedures ara not acceptable to
the Mouse Select Committee which prefers te deal with each

33

+ yequest on an ad hoc basis. We can expect similar problens

with other Coumitteés of Congress, each of which ia concerned
about preserving its own tonony and carrying out what it

excelves to be a separate legislative or oversight mandate.
s . # 2 SE. Ai
This mekes it necessary for us ko respond in different ways

to different Committees of Congress, even though there is
considerable overlap in the type of information requested.

4g you might expect these demands inmose a
substantial administrative burden on each of the arencies
favolved. In an effort te minimise this problem, I have
appointed a Special Gounsel for Intelligence Coordination
who reports directly to me in these matters. The Bureau
has also created a special weit to handle these requests,

d ent and clerical pexsonnel. netheless

staffed by several z
the demands have been ge great that it is often impossible

to comply in @ wanner which is satisfaetory to the Committees.

In ny opinion, we will soon be at a point where the effort

needed to comply in a complete and timely fashion to Congres~
sional demands will seriously wderuine the ability of these
agencies to cerry out their normal investigative responsibilities.

sitive sources cr ongoing

city of Congressional ate
spread dissemination of these materials
inereases the Likelihood ef inpreser &
preblem is aggravated im the House by Rule 11 which
provides that information furnished to a Cosmittes is
available upon request to any mecher of the House. As
you knov, Rule 7.5 af the House Rules for the Select
Committee on Intellig: Activities states that, ‘Unt
such time as the comzlttee b:s sub ted its final report

to the House, classified or cther sensitive information

in the ceumitree records and files shall not be made
available or disclesad to other then the committee uwember-
ship and the coumittee staff, except as may be otherwise
detarmined by the committea." Tt is not at all clear,
hovever, whether the Corsd.ttee Rules superseds established
xules of the House. Fur core, Rule 7.3 dcoas not deal
with the ultinute disposition of such materiale once the
Committee has submitted tts Finel report. Until this matter
is resolved, wea have no real assurance that this information
wlll be afforded the proper safeguarda.

Th

disclestxe. The

These problems can be greatly alleviated vichout
any impairment of Congressional responsibilities by the
oreation cf a joint oversight Committee. “A consolidation
of the oversignt i ene Comittee would reduce
euplication of ef ce the ability of the
Congress te acqu: formation needed fer an intel-
ligent and reasoned jude

nt in these matters, It would
also minimize the competitive atnosphere which presently
exishs among some of thesa Committees. I would urge,
therefore, that such a proposal be made to the join
leadership of Congress, with a view teward the p
resolution of thie issuc.

by SSC Staff Member Jim Dick on 8/26/75, Referenced letter
requested, in Part I, Item 1, delivery of these materials

Member Mark Gitenstein had asked Special Counsel to the
Attorney General Shaheen if we could deliver these materials
by 9/5/75. They are being forwarded herewith, Inasmuch as
the materials contain information originating with NSA,
Supervisor J. P. Thomas, on 9/4/75, contacted Mr, Frank
Foster, NSA, to obtain clearance to furnish the material
which originated with NSA to the SSC. Mr. Foster, after
clearing with Mr. Benson Buffham, advised that NSA had no
objection to our releasing this—information and, in fact,
believed that the substance of the material was already in
the hands of the SSC. Exact copies of the materials being

phone number OL2-4671I, teldphonically advised that he had been
contacted by Martha Tally, Senate Select Committee Staff Member,
and was requested to make himself available for Staff interview
concerning the history of the Security Indices (Index) and the
Bureau's relationship to the Department concerning this matter.
Tally advised Bland that they had been given a detailed briefing |

. concerning this matter by Assistant Director Wannall of the In-
telligence Division. Bland was advised that he had a right to
counsel during interview;. however, the Bureau could not provide
him with private counsel. .He was also informed that there were

. certain areas to which he may properly refuse to answer any
questions. Those areas are where responses might tend to
identify a confidential source, information concerning sensitive
investigative techniques, information derived from other Govern-
ment agencies, including information from foreign intelligence
sources, and any information the disclosure of which coul
adversely affect ongoing investigations.

Assoc. Dit. —_-

Bland advised that. ‘he would furnish a written eee
ment of information of this interview to Section Chief William 0.
Cregar and that should any problem arise as to. his being released
from his. employment agreement. he may be reached in Williamsburg,

SENSTUDY - 75

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting
of the Policy Steering Group held at CIA Headquarters on
8-27-75. In Mev Colby's absence, the meeting was chaired
. by Majo¢ General Jack E. Thomas (Ret. ), Acting Deputy Associate
Director of the DCI for the Intelligence Community. - In
attendance were Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President,
James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President,
Mitchell Rogovin,. Special Counsel to the Director of Central
Intelligence, Michael E. Shaheen, the Department's Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Inspector John B. Hotis,
SA Leon F. Schwartz and representatives of the State Department,
Department of the Treasury, Department of Defense, Office of
Management and Budget, and the National Security Agency.

_ The primary purpose of the meeting was.to discuss
current relations with the House Select Committee. Mr. Rogovin,
Special Counsel to the Director of Central Intelligence, said
he met earlier that day with A. Searle Field, Staff Director
of the House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities and
discussed several topics of interest to the intelligence com-
manity. Field said that starting on 9-17-75 the Committee
plans to hold additional public hearings using the same general
format as in the past. At the outset, the Committee will call
the people at the operational level, such as Assistant Directors.
The heads of the agencies will be usked to testify at the final
hearings held ac the end of the year.

Rogovin said Mx. Field expressed concern about the
possibility that some agencies were intimidating witnesses. Ue
was referring to the arrangement whereby agency employees who
appear as witnesses are required to write memoranda reporting
the substance of the interviews. Field was primarily concerned
about voluntary witnesses, those "who might be coming in the

-back door." He agreed, however, to bee AD SES A

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY, SENSTUDY - 75

followed by the Senate Select Committee concerning abuse
interviews versus investigative interviews. Although it would
be possible to have an Agent present during the investigative
interview, he would be required to leave the room if there
was a discussion of abuse practices. This, of course, would
not prevent an individual from having counsel of his own
choice present during the interview. :

Rogovin said his own view is that an agency can
supply counsel as long as the employee realizes that there is
a potential conflict of interest and that the counsel's first.
allegiance is to the agency. It was pointed out that the
Department of Justice has taken the position that a potential

. conflict of interest prevented it from providing counsel for
the employees during these interviews. He was told that

the Department of Justice is researching the question of
whether the Government can reimburse an employee who finds

it necessary to employ private counsel at his own defense.
Rogovin said he felt that the Department's position was
iniconsistent with its participation in the lawsuits involving
Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell, et al., in which the Department
is providing legal representation. Rogovin said he believed
an effort was underway to set up a panel of attorneys in
Washington who might represent such employees as a public
service.

Rogovin said he had been advised that Edward Rodex -
had recently been dismissed from his position as staff
investigator by Mr. Field. Field is now concerned that Roder
will return to nis former job as a reporter for the "Baltimore
Sun" and "leak" information obtained in his capacity as staff
investigator. He asked Rogovin for advice on how he thought
the secrecy agreement signed by tue Committee staff members
could best be enforced in this case. Field asked to be advised
of any inconsistencies where members of his staff used poor :
judgment. Rogovin cited a recent case in which a staff
investigator asked a senior official of CIA who spoke with a
noticeable accent whether he had ever been a member of the
German Intelligence Service.

Rogovin said Field insisted upon learning the
identity of all informants and proprietaries, including
officers and directors. he was told that this information

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY, SENSTUDY - 75

would not be furnished to him, since it sis given very limited
dissemination even within the intelligence community. Field -
said this position demonstrates a lack of trust toward the
Committee and its staff members and a failure to respect their
legislative mandate. Rogovin said that is not the issue; rather
it is whether it is wise to entrust all that sensitive informa~
tion to one person.

ay As a final item he said that Congressman Les Aspin
had asked for a briefing on electronic surveillance practices.
Rogovin said Aspin is one of the brightest members on the
Committee and can be a leader in molding the opinion of the
Committee. Wilderotter said we should not honor. Aspin's request
until we have some assurances that he will maintain the confi-
dentiality of such information. . He suggested that we "hold up
until the Committee has a better track record."

Rogovin then asked for comments from those in
attendance concerning a draft letter from Mr. Colby as Director
of Central Intelligence to Congressman Pike concerning procedures
that would be followed with respect to requests for documents
and interviews of witnesses (copy attached). Mr. William G.
Hyland, Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of
State, said that his Department will not provide a reading room
for Committee staff members, nor will they give a brief
description of documents belonging to another agency. It was
suggested and agreed that the wording of the draft letter will
be revised to eliminate any references to a “brief description"
of documents withheld for Third Agency clearances.

The question of the ultimate disposition of documents
and other materials furnished the Committee was raised once
again. Several of the attendees expressed serious concern
about the failure of the draft letter to take a firm position
on the need for a resolution of this issue. It was pointed out
that all of the ultimate safeguards and procedures would be to
no avail if such information was ultimately published or made
available to the other members of Congress without restriction.
Mr. Wilderotter suggested that we should refuse any further
cooperation until this matter is resolved. Mr. Buchen felt,
however, this was not a realistic position to take and instructed
Rogovin to alter the wording of the letter to strengthen the
demand that a prompt decision be made in this matter.

- : Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY, SENSTUDY - 75

“Mr. Hotis said that the list of sensitive categories
set out in the draft letter was not broad enough to meet the
Bureau's needs. It was pointed out, for example, that the
list did not extend to information the disclosure of which
would jeopardize ongoing investigations. In addition it was
noted that the agency was permitted to withhold names of 7
citizens or organizations only where it had "pledged" confi-
dentiality. Mr. Rogovin agreed to change the wording to
include persons or organizations with whom the agencies had
a confidential relationship. Mr. Buchen said that the letter
would not be sent on behalf of the entire intelligence community.
He wanted to see "how this would fly" and if it was successful
each agency could draft similar letters tailored to meet its
own needs,

It was also agreed that the wording in the last
paragraph of page 2 of the letter dealing with deliberative
documents would be changed to insure that it would apply to all
documents involved in the executive decision-making processes.

At the close of the meeting Mr. Hotis expressed
_ grave concern over the growing number of Congressional Committees
exercising oversight responsibilities over the FBI. In addition
to the Select Committees of both Houses, staff members of the
House Subcommittees on Civil and Constitutional Rights and
Government Information and Individual Rights have recently
contacted present or former employees of the Bureau in an effort
to conduct interviews. We have also received requests from
the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the
Administration of Justice and the Subcommittee on Postal Facilities,
Mail and Labor Management for information on Bureau practices
regarding electronic surveillances and mail openings, respectively.
Not only does this impose a severe administrative burden on the
Bureau, but it also increases the likelihood that sensitive
information furnished to these Committees will eventually be
compromised. Mx. Hotis said that chere was an urgent need for
consolidation cf these Committees and suggested it would be
helpful if the Administration discussed such proposals with
leaders of Congress. Mr. Buchen agreed and asked that a
letter be directed to him setting forth the problems, which

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
7 WASHINGTON,D.C, 20505

The Honorable Otis G, Pike, Chairman
Select Committee on Intelligence

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Chairman Pike:

“On July 25th I left with you a packet of materials
concerning procedures that might be appropriate in
handling the variety of demands your committee will :
be making-upon the Agency in the months to-come. Since
then we’ have. had a number of frank discussions regarding
security and other aspects of your Committee's
investigation. In addition, the Committee's Staff
Director has held a series of discussions with our
Special Counsel and members of my staff. With this then
as background, let me suggest the adoption of certain
procedures that I believe will insure our ability to
respond promptly and fully to the needs of the Coumittee

-I. Documents:

Upon receipt of a written request for documents
dealing with a particular area of inquiry, the Agency will
promptly respond with an answer,.a partial response or
least a-statement as to when the materiais-:will be © "07"
available. To insure that there are no misunderstandings
as to the materials requested, I have encouraged our staff
to contact your staff members and discuss the precise

“nature of any request not clear on its face. Further,

our staff has been instructed to make materials available
as soon as they are ready and not hold up a response
until all of the materials requested have been compiled.
When documents are withheld because clearance is being

“sought from another Agency, your committee will be notified.

and a brief description of the document will be given.

oon :

P7g1M®



To assist us. in servicing your requests we have
asked that where practical, the request for documents be
as specific as possible and that your staff coordinate
their requests so that House Select Committee priorities
will be given to the various demands.. We have set up a .,
reading room at the Agency where documents will be made. ©

‘available for examination.

‘ With respect to the documents to be made available.
to the Committee, there are certain sensitive materials
that must be protected not only from exposure but even the
risk of exposure. Included in this sensitive category
are: : : :

--names of agents and sources;

“--names of persons involved in Agency operations
‘ who would he subject to personal, physical

danger, to extreme harassment or to economic
or other reprisals if their names were to be
publicly identified:

--material provided confidentially by. cooperating

foreign intelligence services; -

--details that would reveal the nature of sensitive
intelligence methods and techniques of collection,
‘by technical and human means;° ~
names of cooperating Americans .and.American
organizations and contacts to whom we Rts
pledged confidentiality.

In. making such deletions, our staff has been instructed
$ describe “thé ‘deletion, ‘e: “Be, asa ‘CIK officer or agent;

in order to-place the material in context. Where your

staff believes that a particular name or detail is critical
to their inquiry, this then should be brought to the
attention of our staff and the matter can be negotiated.
I--believe this.procedure is-consistent with your statement
to me that the Committee.is not interested in our sources
and methods, or in the names of agents. ;

Finally, some proposed testimony and requests for
documents may enter the area nf the executive decision-
- making process in which the need to protect the
confidentiality of advice or recommendations to policy-
making bodies has long been recognized. This would apply,

NW_55171_ DocId:32989644., Page 160



eevenerreeene! ‘
for example, to Presidential or 40 Committee deliberations
relating to approval of CIA actions. Where such a
‘ circumstance exists, we would-advise the Committee that
executive approval being sought and that we would be
in further touch with your staff on the matter.

We will want to work together, too, to protect certain
other information which, if improperly disclosed, could impair
the legitimate rights of privacy of individuals. I am sure
we can deal with these matters so as to protect this essential
privacy while satisfying the Select Committee's need for a
full understanding of intelligence activities.

_II. Witnesses: : ‘
You doubtless will ‘want to interview present and |
former CIA employees. Current employees will, of course, be
made available to the Select Committee for staff interviews
and for testimony. This on rare occasions may require
‘special arrangements , including testimony under alias, to
protect the identity of employees whose safety or future
utility might be. jeopardized by. exposure. With respect to
the interview of Agency employees who are currently on
detail to other agencies in the government and whose
testimony relates to CIA matters, we will arrange with the
_ host agency to make the employee available upon request of
the Committee. Where the employee is sought to testify with
: respect “to. matters concerning his ‘detail or matters relating:
to the host agency, we will bring your request to the
attention of the host agency. Thus, if your staff will advise
us of whom they wish to interview, we will make the
mployees.. While I “have
: ty to “direct” ‘the co tion of ex- “employees , Tr
will be happy to assist you in any I can. In a very few
cases, their identities also will have to be protected.

As you know, each employee had to sign a security

'. agreement- upon -entering-on duty. -This requires that he --+- ~+-

keep forever secret all classified information gained

during his employment, unless he obtains prior authorization
-to disclose it from the DCI. These secrecy agreements

signed by our employees and ex-employees need not impair

the necessary work of your Committee. In view of the

security protection contemplated by your Committee,

I have determined that disclosure of otherwise protected

information to t@h Select Committee or its designated

staf£ members will, iphost instances, constitute a fully

authorized provision of information within the meaning

of the secrecy agreements. This letter may be used to

NW 55171 Doold:32989644 Page 161


NW 55171

indicate Hee, fetes for any Agency x eee to furnish
information to the Select’ Committee or to appropriate
staff members on matters which otherwise would be

covered by their secrecy agreement. Where, however, the
answer to the particular question covers the highly
sensitivé matters mentioned above, the employee or

former employee is obligated to consult with the Agency
before responding. In this regard, the Agency should be
notified before the Comhittee contacts each Agency employee
or ex-employee who is to be interviewed or called to
testify. JI attach a separate letter addressed to CIA
ex-employees which should be shown to them for the

same purpose. ;

Since so many of our activities involve sensitive
areas, I propose a procedure which should aid the Committee
in expediting its investigation. If the Committee will °
notify Mitchell Rogovin, Special Counsel to.the Director,
of the areas of its. inquiry at the outset, we would be
in a position to highlight particularly sensitive issues

_ and work out methods to insure that your Committee obtains
what it needs without unnecessary risk to the sensitive
matters. We will then be in a position to advise the

“Committee whether any particularly sensitive issues
.may be involved; Such a procedure will insure you get
the information you need to perform your task and at the
same time safeguard sensitive intelligence sources and |
methods which-I am obligated by aw .to protect,

7 In “conclusion, we ask‘that your Committee make an
early determination as.to the ultimate disposition of its
7 records pon completion £ its. tasks I am sure you .... |
“will join me in recognizing that permanent Afe™
and security safeguards will be necessary to protect the-
sensitivity of the Committee's records. To this end you
may wish to discuss permanent disposition with the
Archivist of the United States.

roan vat

It is in our mutual interests to ensure that your
review proceeds as smoothly and as expeditiously. as
possible. Toward that end, I have instructed all CIA
personnel to respond in a Spirit of cooperation. A
‘copy of that instruction is attached. And, I am prepared
to consult with the Committee at any time té determine
appropriate courses of action?

,

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby
Director

Reference is made to Part III of the August 20,

1975, request by the SSC for FBI materials for delivery by
August 29, 1975.

The materials requested in Part III of the
aforementioned request have been processed, with exceptions
noted below, and will be delivered to the Committee on
August 29, 1975, with this communication. A

Item 2 of the request inquired concerning a

"Library" of “handout"' material maintained by ‘the New Left
Reporting Unit" in 1970. The term "library" has been used
by this Bureau to describe such material in a general sense.
No. formal, permanent, cataloged collection of material has
existed. Rather, it has heen the practice of supervisors
handling ‘New Left" matters to maintain in their office
space copies of material which came to their attention in
the course of their duties and which might be of value in
quickly responding to requests for, ox inquiries concerning,
such materiai, This practice continues. The raterial consists
of both classified and unclassified documents, such as
articles by former Director J, Edgar Hoover, as well as
newspaper clippings, magazine articles and pamphiets. No
formal record has been maintained of the materials on hand
at any particular date. Neither vas any centralized, formal
record made of the recipients to whom materials were furnished
or what materials were furnished. The current collection of
such material is available for review by SSC Staff Members

offices.

Item 7 of the request related to the so-called
“program” entitled "Communist Influence. on Racial Groups,"

“Communist Influence in Racial Matters (CIEM)" and documents
responsive to your inquiry relating to the orisin, approval
and current reporting requirements in that matter are being

investigation, rather than a program. Aceordingly, no
provisions were made for regular periodic reviews of this

would be available in the case of a program, have been located.

Ttems 12 and 13 related to the March on Vashington
and the Communist Party's influence in racial matters
subsequent to the March on Washington. Compliance with
these tvo requests involves location of approximately 250
volumes of material, their review and processing for delivery
of those portions responsive to these requests. The
magnitude of this undertaking, concurrent with the handling
of the other extensive requests contained in the referenced
Aucust 20, 1975, request, has made it impossible to complete
work on these tvo items to date, Our efforts te provide a
comprehensive response to Items 12 and 13 are continuing on
a priority basis and it is anticipated that delivery of
desired materials to the Committee will be made by
September 8, 1975.

BY S8G START! ERE INT OPM ATION CONTAINED

7 pare MTB sv

On August 12, 1975, FBI SA James P. Kehoe, assigned
to the New York Field Office, traveled to Washington, D, C.,
at the request of the SSC for the purpese of a Staff
interview. He was accompanied by his attorney, Nr. Herbert
Kantor, who was present during the interview, took notes,-
ami subsequently prepared a statement concerning the interview.

Attached to this memorandum is Mr. Kantor's.
statement. :
SA Kehoe has advised of two corrections which
should be noted relative to Mr. Kantor's statement. On
page 6, paragraph 1, line 9, the word “familiar” should
have read Yanfamiliar. " On page 9, first complete paragraph,
line 4, a senterice begins "It reviewed several hundred
pieces..." The complete sentence should be altered to
read "It reviewed several hurdred pieces of mail a day to
obtain letters addressed to Soviet personnel." The next
assoc. ox. — SONtence which reads, “ALL such letters were brought back
Dep. AD Adm. — Hoey the EBL and photographed," refers only to those addressed

Dep. AD Inv. —

andi. to Soviets and not to the several hundred pieces as is

Aine —— implied in the manner in which it appears in Kantor's
eaten — Statement. ) Z f ey)

“Anterception, and that the Department of Justice had ‘approved

F

CE BO Leedecakcetenda as follows: —
Q2GN" : “.. James Dick initiated the questioning. Kehce stated
Bane that he had been given no specific instructions from the

Bureau as. to how he was to. testify. He stated that he was 2

Special Agent of the FBI having entered service in 1951 and

8622/63 25 EV



- that he'was* ou “to counter cee, for approximately

22 years. His squad was tsoncerned with Soviet espionage activities

in the United States eos ad. |

Kehoe identified the agents in charge of the New York

‘ Office during his tenure (LaPrade, Malone,. Foster, Powers and

|
Schmidt) and his immediate supervisor in the mid 1960's (Brandt).

Kehoe stated that he worked exclusively in counter ‘4ntelli gence
except for occasional manpower BERER RE when he might be
assigned other temporary duties.

Kehoe stated ‘that all requests ‘for. mail covers were

forwarded through his office to the Director in Washington and

,_ that approval would be returned in the same manner, All com-
smund cations fron Washington . came under the name of the Director.
Upon receipt of the approval, contact would be made with local

postal inspectors i

Direct- communications with postal inspectors might take

. Place in special circumstances. For example, if a subject being

- surveiled placed a letter in a mailbox, postal inspectors might

be requested to locate the letter and advise the name of the

addressee. No search warrant would be obtained under such eir~
-° cumstances. Kehoe stated that all investigative. contacts with :
the postal service yere made with postal inspectors. Mail carrier
and other personnel were not contacted directly. The FBI mein-
tains liason with the post office, but individual agents “could
contact postal BHSPeehors | directly in certain matters connected

With their cases. Kehoe could not recall the names of the liason

i ' men in the mid 1960's. | &.. i

and in connection with mail procedures. In 1959. Kehoe suggested

NW 55171 DocId:32989644 Page 180

that a program to review outgoing foreign. matl be initiated. The
suggestion for the program was submitted to his supervisor and th

agent in charge forwardéd the suggestion to the Director. He did

‘not recall how long the request was pending in Washington , but

. Stated a it was approved and ‘continued for approximately four

years. :

Arrangements were made. with postal pene to have
postal employees deliver certain ‘air mail to a room in the air
mail building where it- was scanned by FBI agents. Le tters to
“specific addresses in certain cities as well as letters having
certain indicators on the outside of the envelope that implied .

a ‘Soviet Connection were withdrawn from the mail and brought

a to the New York Office. Kehoe stated that the indicators

., Were received from a sensitive source and could not be re-

vealed. He confirmed that there was good reason to believe
that the indicators, were accurate ‘and the program paalctinasbaneiavere

proved their validity, * ‘The program was given the acrony si

! designation "SAM Survey" and assigned a case file. The mail

‘that was scanned under this program included mail going to both

Eastern and Western European countries. Kehoe stated that he

““believed the program was terminated by the Director in 1963,



although he is avare that newspaper reports had indicated that

_the program might have continued thereafter, ¢

A separate prograi ‘ding for the review of all
mail addressed to the Soviet establishments in New York was
conducted at or about the same tine as SAM. This project

received the: designation "2 Coverage". To. Kehoe ts kmowledge pansueea!

the "Z" project was not generic, but related specifically
to mail addressed to the Soviet mission to the United Nations.
‘Kehoe did not know how the Z program was initiated but believed
that: it too was terminated by the Director in the mia 1960's.
: . Athird mail program designated "SUN Survey"
“-parallelea the other two programs during the early 1960's.
(nis program included ceanning the mail addressed to all

‘Soviet personnel at “a post office box reserved for the United

“Nations. _ This’ mail included Soviet citizens working at the-
ve “‘Unitea Nations other than in the Soviet United Nations mission. .
i : te Kehoe stated that he was not aware of any other mail intercept
program involving the Soviets fe stated further that he would
fet have mo knowledge as to whether any other mail ‘intercept programs
existed with respect to non-Soviet matters. Kenoe said that
he aid not know the members of the China squad ana that he had
not heard of the Hawailan Project. Kehoe said that he partici-
pated in ae and SUN but not in Z. If a project originated out

of the New york office or was conducted by it, it would be un-

dikely that. the SAC would not have knowledge of tbe

“: ‘that there was no delay. A list of known Soviet mail drops

worked on the project at various times, ‘The ‘special indicators

- Kehoe stated that he had read the Rockefeller Committee

report concerning the CIA mail program. — He stated that the

differences in the programs between the CIA and FBI may have
.. been-due to the differing functions of the agencies. Kehoe
