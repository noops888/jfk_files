The raid is now scheduled for 12/27/63 after
several postponements caused by adverse weather conditions
and by motor trouble with the first plane selected.

This office has been keeping other local agencies,
such ab U.S. Customs, U.S. Coast Guard, Border Patrol, FAA,
State Dept., U.S. Attorney, ONI, G-2 and OSI advised of
developments in this case. U.S. Customs and FAA have primary
jurisdiction. All of these agencies have expressed great
interest in this operation and it appears that without, the
cooperation of ALPIZAR, these plans might have proceeded
without detection. U.S. Customs plans to seize the boat and
the bombs as they depart Florida waters.

In 6/63 ALPIZAR furnished information in the case
entitled "MIGUEL ALVAREZ JIMENEZ, aka; ET AL (alleged plan to
bomb Shell Oil refinery, Havana, Cuba, 6/15/63), NM" (Bufile
2-1810), which resulted in seizure by Customs of a plane and
bombs as the plane was about to depart Miami on a bombing
raid.

ALPIZAR refused to accept compensation on that
occasion; however, due to the great amount of time and effort
he has spent voluntarily in assisting this office in instant
case, he has been paid: $75.00 on 12/12/63 and $100.00 on
12/24/63.

It is requested the Bureau authorize this office
to pay him up to an additional $200.00 for services rendered,
following additional developments in this case, on a C.0.D.
basis.

Consideration is being given to opening a new 134
case _on ALPIZAR =
