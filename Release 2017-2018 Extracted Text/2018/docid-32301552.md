MM 105-2855

The raid is now scheduled for 12/27/63 after

several postponements caused by adverse weather conditions

and by motor trouble with the first plane selected.

This office has been keeping other local agencies,

such as U.S. Customs, U.S. Coast Guard, Border Patrol, FAA,

State Dept., U.S. Attorney, ONI, G-2 and OSI advised of

developments in this case.

U.S. Customs and FAA have primary

jurisdiction. All of these agencies have expressed great

interest in this operation and it appears that without the

cooperation of ALPIZAR, these plans might have proceeded

without detection. U.S. Customs plans to seize the boat and

the bombs as they depart Florida waters.

In 6/63 ALPIZAR furnished information in the case

entitled "MIGUEL ALVAREZ JIMENEZ, aka; ET AL (alleged plan to

bomb Shell Oil refinery, Havana, Cuba, 6/15/63), NM" (Bufile

2-1810), which resulted

in seizure by Customs of a plane and

bombs as the plane was about to depart Miami on a bombing

raid.

ALPIZAR refused to accept compensation on that

occasion; however, due to the great amount of time and effort

he has spent voluntarily in assisting thie office in instant

case, he has been paid $75.00 on 12/12/63 and $100.00 on

12/24/63.

It is requested the Bureau authorize this office

to pay him up to an additional $200.00 for services rendered,

following additional developments in this case, on a C.O.D.

basis.

Consideration is being given to opening a new 134

case on ALPIZAR.
