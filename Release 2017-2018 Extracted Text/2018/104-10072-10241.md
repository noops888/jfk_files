MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting With WUSLAB/on 10 April 1970

Security and Arrangements: The meeting took place at

[USLAB/1'3 home where he is still recuperating from his eye

operation.

I had to delay my arrival from 1200 until 1230,

and I phoned him concerning the delay.

He answered the door

and we went upstairs where we sat in an upstairs study. I left

at about 1400.

2. Production: (WUSLAB/Isaid that Jose Raul Viera Linares

who had had

and that Viera now realized the seriousness of the case and

that WUSLAB/1 would not be able to travel. Viera said that

the charices were now remote that he would be returning to New

A friend of his named "Rogelio" would contact WUSLAB/1/

He did not say when or where, but it would be when circumstances

permit. VUSLAB/Jasked if Viera might be assigned to another

foreign country.

Viera did not deign to answer

this question.

3. I asked [WUSLAB/I/what he considered the

Viera were. He, thought an important factor wöuld

be Viéra's

He would not be

but he did like good living.

He also pro-

bably did not like living in Havana, and would not like to stay

there for a very long period. LW/1 thought that if Viera came

out to a countru such as Spain

could

easily

In the United

States Viera was

on his

guard.

Also in the United States Viera did not have high level

contacts with the local government, whereas in other countries

he would be expected to have such

contacts. Some of those con-

tacts might then be also in contact with U.S. /officials and you

could get a cross-check on Viera.

carlos Antonio Carrasco, the National Director for

education Planning, visited

WUSLAB/1/onl97April 1970.

Carrasco

claimed that the Bolivian government is in a period of stalemate.

There is progress being made in only two fields. One of these

is planning and the other is education. The Minister of Education

Mariano Baptista has more power than

some of the other ministers.

The education budget has been increased, and he has some say

in the selection of the Ministry of Education's

personnel.

Even

though the military blocked appointments for Maria Elba Gutierrez

and Professor Chavez they are still in the ministry; Chavez in

the

"Instituto Normal" and Maria Elba as Secretary General of

the Ministry (the third ranking post in the ministry.) Baptista

has good relations with the United States which is helping the

education program.

The cabinet seems to be rather stable at

the moment, although there continues to be pressure to remove

Rolon Anaya and Marcelo Quiroga.

The latter is a candidate to

replace Juan Lechin Oquendo as the secretary general of the

union organization.

The strongest military man in the govern-

ment from the standpoint of firmness is Edmundo Valencia, the

Minister of National Economy.

5.

The civilian cabinet members believe that the United

States

is happy with them.

They think that the military are

incapable of running the

government.

There has been no in

dication of a Scandle among the cabinet members. There is also

a freeze on Bolivian-US relations. The military continues to

be worried because there is not a political party behind the

government.

Some of the civilians wanted to gain the support

of the MR, but the military did not want to do that.

6. Carrasco gave one example of the military-civilian

interplay:

The Minister of Education Baptista wanted the education

signed on 9 April 1970 which is the anniversary of the 1952

revolution.

Valencia opposed it because it was the anniversary.

Colonel Juan Ayoroa continues to be opposed to the return of MNR

people to the government.

7. Hernan Siles when he was in Bolivia saw Losada, Baptista,

and twice saw Ovando. The reason for his removal from the

country is as follows: Arellano denounced Siles to General

Torres and gave him some written material on a plot. Torres

then announced that there was a plot set for 9 April. Colonel

Ayora called Siles.

in and said that he had to leave Bolivia

within four days.

The government wanted him out of the country

on 9 April. Ayoroa told Siles that he could return to Bolivia

on 10 April.

Carrasco received the above story from Siles to

whom he talked many times.

Ovando believes that Siles is no

longer interested in governmental power.

He is interested in

the MR, and he does want to destroy the political power of

Victor Paz Estenssoro.

While in Bolivia Siles allienated Serate-

Reich, Arellano, etc.

Siles attributes to Arellano his betrayal

to the government.

8. Nothing has happened on Paz's negotiations with the

government.

9. The arrival of the Soviet Ambassador has produced good

consequences

according

to Carrasco. Relations are smoother

with the American ambassador. The Bolivians feel freer to be

more friendly knowing there is someone else to turn to. The

Soviet presence is a sop to placate the left in Bolivia. It

serves as a substitute for the lack of leftist participation

in the government.

Ovando may use the Soviets as

the need

arises, just as be will try and use the Americans.

10. Ovando and Torres wanted to expelf a Colonel Limay

who is a very right-wing government employee.

The military

opposed it and he is still in his job.

Ovando has been thinking

of a constituent assembly as a device to legalize his government.

He very much wants a legal presidency.

11. Plans: (WUSLAB/1 will be returning to limited office

work the week of 13%April7

I promised to call him during the

week. (A cable was sent on the Viera information on 10 April.)
