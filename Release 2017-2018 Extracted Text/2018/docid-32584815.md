an association of politicians of Italian extraction who are be-
lieved to be associated closely with gambling and hoodlum ele-
ments), as a former partner of SA‘ GIANCANA in the Windy City
Sports Enterprises.

to disclose.~ This’ informant told NESTOR that his information

was that TONY ACCARDO and SAM GIANCANA were active in the mobs
attempts to muscle in on the shrimp industry. Lieutenant NESTOR
furnished this information as a rumor, and contacts with WALTER
DEVEREAUX, Chief Investigator of the Chicago Crime Commission, -
reflected that that Commission's information came from Lieutenant
NESTOR and that the Commission had been unable to verify the
rumor.

In February, 1953, CG 5841-C advised that SAM GIANCANA,
'.-whom he described as a lieutenant of TONY ACCARDO, appears at
the Rainbow Lounge, 5146 West Cermak Road, Cicero, Illinois,
every Monday evening. According to the informant, at that time
GIANCANA holds court in which he settles all disputes amongst
members of the hoodlum element, makes his underworld contacts,
and is available to any hoodlum who may need money or advice.

Lieutenant JOSEPH MORRIS, Scotland Yard Detail, Chi- |
cago Folice Department, has advised that GIANCANA leasés a base-
ment room of the Imperial. House, a swanky after theater supper

club at 50 East Walton Place as a meeting plage. This restaurant} °*

is operated by an Italian using the name BENYSCOTT through whom

allegedly GIANCANA receives his orders, iby any
