Miami ghetto racial informants were responsible for the \
identification of the principal suspects in four fire bombings,
3 and this information enabled local police to make the arrest
of the suspects and charge them with first-degree arsdn.

A Cleveland racial informant obtained advance information
concerning planned racial violence. This was furnished to the
4 police department which took appropriate preventive action.

In May, 1969, New _Orleans and Jackson informants ware
instrumental in neutralizing high order explosives which were in
5 possession of the Mlan. This action has probably saved lives |
since the Klan group involved has terrorized Ecgroes in the past,

2 Detxoit racial informant furnished advance information
regarding planned. ambush of Detroit police officers which
enabled the Datroit Police Departrent to take necessary action
to prevent injury or death to the officers and resulted in the
arrest of eight persons and the seizure of a cache of weanons. |

b The informant also furnished information resulting in the
lecation and confiscation by Bureau Agents of approximately 50
stichs of dynamite available to BPP and likely resulted in saving
of lives and preventing possible property damage.

A Chicago, racial informant furnished information which
identified an individval who is a member of the BPP as the
person who raped and shot a housewife and then pistol whipped her
husband in Chicage on December 25, 1970, he same Chicago

7 infornant furnished information which resulted in the idontifi-
cation of an individual who was responsible for the murder of a
police officer in Carbondale, Illinois.

A Springfield ghetto informant furnished information
soncerning an individual vhe was attometing to sell explosives.
This information cnabled local authorities to apprehend the
individual and confiscate 100 pounds of explosives.

BPP and leaders of the Richmond Information Center (RIC), an

TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

As a result of this information developed and other
investigation, two of the BPP leaders in Washington and three
RIC leaders in Richmond, Virginia, were subsequently indicted

q by a Federal Grand Jury. Subsequent trial resulted in the
conviction of the two Washington, D. C., leaders and two of the
RIC leaders.

Detroit extremist informants advised that a BPP member
was involved in a holdup killing in Detroit. Fe also advised
that this individual was carrying the same pistol used in the
killing, which enabled the Detroit police to arrest the BPP
member, recover the pistol, and determine that this weapon was
used in the killing referred to above.

A Detroit informant provided information which saved
two lives. This informant, who was a member of the BPP, was
instrumental in saving the lives of two BPP members who were

ll being disciplined by the BPP, His information, when furnished
to local police, was responsible for the arrest of seven BPP mem-
bers, who were charged with kidnapping and assault to do bodily
harm less than murder.

A Memphis informant furnished information which prevented
a shoot-out Détwéen members of the BPP chapter and the Memphis
|? Police Department.

In duly, 1971, a then recently developed member informant
of the black extremist "Afro Set," headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio,
furnished us extensive information concerning criminal activities
by this group, including information related to several murders
of whites which occurred in 1970. We furnished this information
to local authorities in Cleveland. Working in conjunction with

3 our Cleveland Office, the Cleveland Police Department instituted
13 an intensive investigation and in October, 1971, a local grand
jury returned secret indictments against six members of
“Afro Set," including its leader, Harellel B. Jones. In
March, 1972, dones received a life sentence following a trial
in which our informant was a key witness. Two other "Afro Set"
functionaries who had been involved in this murder plot pleaded
guilty and received life sentences.

December 9, 1975

Senator Frank Church
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Church:

i ‘Taking the liberty of presuming on our short past acquain-
tance, I am writing you to express my deep concern over the
tragic adverse criticism being levelled at the FBI in the
news media as a result of current congressional inquiries

| into United States intelligence operations.

As you well know, ninety per cent (90%) of the work of
the Bureau is concentrated on the investigation of violations
of U. S. criminal statutes over which the FBI has primary
investigative jurisdiction. Your committee and the other
committees of the Congress now looking into the activities of
the Bureau are therefore examining and criticizing the work
which constitutes a very small percentage of their overall
‘responsibility. Not to stress the long and successful history
of the Bureau along with the few mistakes (the Congress itself
has had its share) they have made over the years is, I think,
unfair and not in the national interest. Just one example of
the effect these stories are having occured Sunday, November 30th,
when the Washington Post carried a letter to the Editor entitled
"The FBI Discredited". That letter followed testimony before
Congressional committees relative to the FBI, ‘much of which was
unfair and misleading. The letter itself, I'm sure you will
agree, contained not one fact but was filled with personal vitu-
perations against the FBI and its officials.

Secondly, you know and I know, as a former congressional
investigator, that each and every witness is interviewed by
committee staff members long before he’ formally appears before
the committee. For the life of me I cannot understand why
a reputable and responsible congressional committee would
allow testimony to be put on the record when it had already
been denied by officials of the FBI and was, in fact, untrue.

I refer, for example, to statements made by Mr. Rowe last week.

This Nation is in grave danger of having its greatest
law enforcement agency (FBI) unnecessarily destroyed based on,

at least partially, untrue and/or unsubstantiated statements
of witnesses,

“I urge you, Senator, to be fair and judicious. To my

mind the current rash of congressional hearings have not been
that.

Proper and effective law enforcement cannot be realized
without the full voluntary cooperation of the citizens of this
country. Congressional hearings and the news media are dis-
troying that bond sometimes for nothing more than political

ambition, financial reward or basic dislike of law enforcement
agencies themselves.

I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of this
letter to Senator Tower, my two Senators and my Congressman.

indicating that then District Birector John L. Todd (now retired)
had received a call early on the morning of March 9, 1969, rela-
ting to 4 disturbence occurring at the home of Thomas Rihn, involy-
ing Mrs. Tannenbaum, Mrs. Wana Riha and her husbend Thomas. This
does not necesrarily mean that he did not receive such a call but
merely that he made no written record of same, if in fact he
received such a cail,

Irrespective of such a call, the immigration stetus of Mrs. Mena
Rihe was already a matter of Service inquiry initiated by the

New York office of INS predicated upon a sixth preference petition
filed in her behalf ag a secretary, to sustain an application she
filed seeking to adjust hor immigration status to thet of a lawful
permanent resident alien, During the pendeney of processing this
application, Mrs. kiha had received an extension of her temporary
gtoy to October 20, 1968, to complete a period of prectical training.

Cn January 28, 1969, the New York office of this Service
addressed 2 request to Hana Riha to appear for an inter-
view on February 5, 1965. This letter was returned to the
New York office bearing an endorsement by Hena Riha’s aunt
advising of Hena's marriage to a U. 3. citizen on October 13,
1968, and her current address in Boulder, Colorado. Accord-
ingly, the Service file was transferred to the Denver office
for continuance of this inquiry.

The Service file of Mrs, Hana Riha contains a hand written
memorandum dated March 7, 1969, indicating a Mrs. Tannenbsum
had called reparding this cease. Tannenbaum wanted to know
what was necessary for approval of an immediate relative visa
petition. Tennenbaum wanted to get it doné right away since
the husband (Thomas Rika} was getting a divorce from the alien
{Hana Riha}d, Also of record in this file are typewritten let-
ters addressed to the Denver office dated March 8 and 9, 1969,
respectively and bearing a signature “Hana Riha" in which the
writer, among other matters, designates Mrs. Tammenbaum as the
person she desires to handie her business with the Immigration
Service and that all correspondence relating thereta be directed
to Tannenbaun's home address.

Cumulatively these letters allege that her marriage to Thomas
Riha was induced by her Aunt, Mrs. Gressman, as ¢ reans of
circumventing the immigration laws and establishing permanent
residence status in the U. S. although she claims she is un-
decided as to whether in fact she desires to remain in the
United States.

.

4 Q. What were the findings of Toddts inquiry?

A. Predicated upon the referenced lettera (supra) and the fact
that Mrs. Riha had overstayed her lawful admission, to wit,
October 20, 1968, Pistrict Director Todd approved an ep,:lica-
‘tion for an Order to Show Cause prepared by a Service inves-
tigator on March 10, 1969, and on March 1, 1969, issued and
aigned an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing on Mrs. Riha
charging her with being subject to deportation pursuant to the
provisions of Section 241(a)}(2) of the Immigration and Nations-
lity Act, in that, after admission as 4 nonimmigrant, she had
remained in the United States for a longer time than permitted.
This Order and Notice were served on Mrs. Riha by registered
mail on March Li, 1969, directing her to appear for a hearing
before a Special Inquiry Office on the charges, to be held at
the Denver INS office at 2:00 P.M., Tuesday, March 25, 1969. On

March 21, 1969, the Denver office received a registered letter
dated March 20, 1969, with enclosure in the form of a Notice

of Appearance as attorney for Hana Riha, in which a continvence
of the scheduled deportation hearing was requested and granted,

The file of Hana @iha contains & memorendum dated April 10,
1969, prepared for the file by then District Director Todd
reporting that at 10;30 P.M. in the evening of April 9, 1969,
he was telephonicalty contacted at his home by a reporter from
the staff of the Colorado Daily, Colorado University, Boulder,
Colorado, who advised he was preparing an article for his paper
and desired some assistance. The reporter stated that a
Mrs. Tannenbaum had informed him that she was employed in some
capacity by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and that
she had the authority to direct what disposition of Mrs. Riha's
ease. The reporter also stated that Professor Riha had disop-
peared two or three weeks beforé from the University and that
Mrs. Tannenbaum had stated his disaypearance was the result of
activities by the secret police of three (3) foreign countries;
that Mrs. Tannenbaum also claimed to have access to certain

a intellipence information in possession of the military author-
ities. In response to specific inquiries che reporter was ad-
vised: by District Director Todd to the effect that (i) a
Urs. Gerald Tannenbaum ig not and has never been, to his knowl~
edge, an employee of INS (2) that he (Todd) had no idea of what
her employment might be and (3) th t he could give him (the re-
porter) no specific information regarding a Professor Riha, the
alleged husband of subject Hana Riha. In conclusion, the memo-
randun suggests that the reporter might desire to contact Mrs. Rihats
attorney since he had already mentioned the name of Mrs. Riha’s
attorney during the course of the conversation.

5. Q. Were these findings communicated to the CIA and the FBI?

A. A memorandum dated April 11, 1969, prepared by thon Deputy Dis-
trict Director Lioyd D. Prowell and addressed ta the file of
ana Riha reports that on April 10, 1969, Prowell telephonically
eontected the Assistant Agent in Charge of the Denver office of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and provided him with the
substance of the information contained in District Director Todd's
memorandum of April 10, 1969, (supra) and implies that such agent
was requested to advise whether a contemplated investigation by
INS would interfere with any actions which might be under consideration
by the FBI.

On April 11, 1969, the Assistant Agent in Cherge of the
Denver EBL office telephonicaliy edvised Mr. Prowell that
huis office had a pending investigation on Urs, Tannenbaum
for alleged numerous impersonations of federal officials,
but that investigation by INS would not interfere with their
operations in this matter. He requested, however, that vpon
completion of any investigation by INS, his office be fur-
nished a copy of the report.

Tavestipation was initiated on Eana Riha the same date.

{April 11, 1969} A report of this investigetion was prepared

on April 23, 1969, and a copy of same was provided to the Den-

yer office of the FBI pursuant to their request. No distri-

‘bution of this report was made to the CIA, eee

Uhy, in the fall of 1969, did the INS in Eenvyer decl
veply at all to an inquiry made by friend of Rike*
whether the professor still was alive? Why was this
o£ Rihafs then told it would te better if he wouldnt:
interested in the Wiha casa?

The Service files of Thomas and Hana Rihe contain no recorded
data indicating that an inguiry was directed to the Denver 17S
office in the fall of 1969 by a friend of l’rofessor Riha, in-
quiring as fo wietber he was still slive, nor any response to
anyone advising "it would be better if he wouldn't be interested
in the kiha case.” ©

NOTE: Despite the alsence of any record of the ehove inquiry,

the declinetion to reply at ail to same would have been entirely
proper, should it have been made and not recorded. Professor Piha
was naturalized 4 citizen of the United States in 1952 and there
were no matters releting to him pending before nnd within the
jurisdiction of INS.

On what basis did the INS in Denver tell one of Kihats friends
in May or June 1969 that Riha was alive? Who in the INS office
in Denver made this report?

The Service files relating to Thomas and Hana kiha contoin no
recorded data that anyone in the Denver INS office ndvised any
inquirer in May or June 1969, or at any other time, that Pro- ~
fessor Xiha was alive. Further, ssid files contcin no factual
information upon which such a response could be predicated.

TOPIC: SEPARATION OF INTELLIGENCE GATHERING FROM LAW
ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS

The question has been raised regarding the
feasibility of separating the intelligence gathering function of
the FBI from the law enforcement function of the FBI.

The functions of the FBI do not neatly fall within
"intelligence" and "law enforcement" categories, Internal security
cases are both intelligence and law enforcement operations and
counterintelligence sometimes involves arrests and prosecutions,
i,e., law enforcement. Thus, the functions of the FBI can more
accurately be broken down into three general missions - law
enforcement, internal security (domestic), and counterintelligence
(foreign), These missions are separate, distinct, and distinguishable
functions, even though each partakes a little of each other.

While counterintelligence could adequately, and with
more success in some cases, be handled by an organization totally
separate from one with law enforcement powers, internal security
work in many cases, is directly related to criminal prosecution.
Complete separation, at least of the internal security function from

law enforcement, does not appear to be practically feasible.

EEE anborneasians 7, iy, 5 9 {FO

NW 55101 DocId:32989554 Page 36



@ e.
_. A

Separation of the internal security function also
presents serious political considerations. Internal security is
the most controversial of government's intelligence collection
activities. In the U.S., this function was originally given to the
FBI which had established for itself a reputation for being respon-
sible, competent, and most importantly, politically neutral and had
the confidence of most Americans. It is to the advantage of an
internal security agency, which is subjected to political pressures,
to be somewhat insulated by being part of a larger, respected
organization which has a high profile as a competent and fair
investigative agency in the less politically complex law enforcement
and counterintelligence fields. Adding to this insulation is the
tradition of FBI political independence, and the new Congressional
concern with keeping the FBI politically independent. While the law

enforcement and counterintelligence wings of the FBI dislike the

controversies into which its internal security wings drag the FBI name,

separation of internal security into a separate agency would probably
subject it to more intense political pressures, both from within the
administration and without, which pressures it might not be capable
of withstanding. Such separation appears politically unfeasible and

undesirable.

NW 55101 DocId:32989554 Page 37



oe s
® oe

Separation of the counterintelligence function would be
more practically feasible; however, the commingling of counterintelli-
gence and internal security interests and the threat of a merger of
the counterintelligence function with the positive foreign intelligence
collection agency, especially in the U.S., are both practical and
political reasons militating against this course.

Practical considerations against divestiture of the
counterintelligence and internal security functions from the FBI are
that: basic criminal investigative experience equips men in many
areas to be intelligence officers; a pool of trained criminal investi-
gators is available to the intelligence missions to draw from, either on
an ad hoc emergency basis, e.g. , seizure of an embassy or political
kidnapping or skyjacking, or as candidates for the position of intelli-
gence officer; a divestiture might result in the loss to the counterintelli-
gence and internal security wings of the effective use of the FBI name,
reputation, and contacts/sources built-up over the years using the FBI
name.

All members of the intelligence community have specific
responsibilities defined by statutes and executive orders. The FBI

maintains close daily liaison with other agencies to insure against

NW 55101 DocId:32989554 Page 38



repetition or overlapping activities. The Congress and the Executive

Branch, in establishing intelligence agencies such as the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency, FBI, etc., must
have considered the need to keep each agency's functions separate,
The CIA, for example, is specifically prohibited from having any

internal security or law enforcement functions. For this reason, in

addition to consideration of experience, efficiency and economy, the
FBI recommends that all three missions of law enforcement, internal

security, and counterintelligence remain with the FBI,

TOPIC: THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE FBI DIRECTOR

TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

The FBI, through Congressional enactment, Executive Order,
and directive of the Attorney General has been charged with the responsi-
bility of performing certain duties subject to the general supervision and
direction of the Attorney General. The Director of the FBI, a Bureau chief
within the Department, having been granted enormous responsibility, must
attain a proper balance between independence and responsiveness in order
to properly discharge this responsibility.

The Director of the FBI must be permitted to discharge his
responsibilities free from political or unethical pressure. This must be
balanced with his responsibility to remain responsive to the Attorney
General's leadership and direction. A Congressional oversight committee,
available to give the FBI counsel, guidance, and direction, can greatly
assist the FBI in achieving and maintaining this balance.

There must be an efficient working relationship, with free and
open channels of communication, between the Director and the Attorney
General. However, the FBI Director must also on occasion communicate
directly with the President and members of the Congressional oversight
committee. The Director must be in a position to register reasoned

disagreement with the Attorney General and if the situation dictates, to

take up important matters of disagreement with the President and the

TOPIC: THE ASSIGNMENT OF FBI AGENTS TO FOREIGN

LIAISON POSTS

The FBI has had FBI Agents serving in foreign liaison posts
since 1940. They are known as Legal Attaches and are regularly called
upon to secure in-depth cooperation from foreign agencies on criminal
and security matters which are frequently of a complicated and sensitive
nature. In order to handle such matters effectively, it is often required
that a Legal.Atiache be proficient in the language of the foreign country
involved and should have some familiarity with the culture, customs and
judicial processes. Simultaneously, it is obviously advantageous to have
a thorough knowledge of FBI jurisdiction, regulations, and policies. This
knowledge can only be achieved through years of experience as an FBI
Agent.

In order to maintain the cooperation of foreign agencies, Legal
Attaches assist these agencies by having investigations conducted in the
United States concerning matters of interest to the foreign countries
involved.

Several options in lieu of maintaining FBI Agents in foreign
countries have been suggested. These include the assignment of Embassy
personnel to handle FBI work, to have FBI interests abroad handled by

other law enforcement agencies which maintain foreign liaison offices,



xe : : e@ .
e e

and the discontinuance of FBI pursuit of foreign ramifications in criminal
and security responsibilities.by FBI personnel and conduct the investigations
through direct communications. All of these alternatives pose serious
problems including security risks, lack of expertise and knowledge of

FBI procedures and policies, etc.

The FBI has found it necessary and, in fact, through experience
it has been demonstrated it is invaluable to have a man stationed abroad
who can insure that prompt and efficient action is taken and that cooperative
relationships are nurtured and protected. Accomplishments attained by
the FBI through the liaison activities of the Legal Attaches with foreign
law enforcement agencies have been numerous, and it is firmly believed
that these successes would not have occurred in the absence of personal
and direct FBI liaison with foreign police agencies.

The FBI currently has Agents stationed in 15 American

diplomatic establishments outside the United States.

TOPIC: THE FBI AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY

The proposal to make the FBI an independent agency within
the Executive Branch has been voiced on several occasions in Congress.
Approximately one year ago, two bills were introduced in the Senate to
achieve this aim.

Proponents of this proposal indicate their basis for supporting
this approach is because of their concern to have the FBI free from political
influence. ‘They cite as an argument the fact the Attorney General is almost
always a political appointee of the President whose views generally conform
with his own.

The question arises whether removal of the FBI from the
Department of Justice is the proper means of assuring a justifiable degree
of independence and freedom from undue political pressure. The FBI as
an independent agency would simply mean the Director would no longer
report to the Attorney General but instead would be responsible directly
to the White House.

Opponents of the proposed Senate bills suggest that some danger
does exist in the FBI's reporting to a political appointee, but a far greater
danger may exist if the FBI, performing as an independent agency, became
the arm of a politically motivated Director who was primarily responsible

. to the White House.

It is the FBI's position the FBI should remain a Bureau within
the Department of Justice where it can properly perform its functions to
investigate violations of various Federal laws and report its impartial
findings to those who will conduct the prosecution of these violations in

our judicial system.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Blaine K, Katz, Richard G. Kinsey, William J. Lander,
Rodney K. McHargue, William F. Moran, Alfred K, Nicholas, Jr.,
Richard H. Ross, . John P, Thomas, and John A. Van Wagenen.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. on Saturday evening,
10/4/75, I received a call from Special Agent Paul V. Daly
of the Legal Counsel Division. Mr. Daly advised that the
Attorney General (AG) had requested the Bureau immediately
prepare a list of electronic surveillances conducted by the
Bureau from 1/1/70 until 6/30/75. In addition, the AG
requested that the supportive documents underlying these
electronic surveillance requests also be provided him. Both
the list and supportive documents were to be on the desk of
the AG by 9:00 a.m., 10/6/75.

After a series of calls, arrangements were made
with the Files and Communications Division to begin pulling
the necessary files needed to prepare the list and provide
the supportive documents. At 9:30 a.m., the above-named
Bureau supervisors reported to the Intelligence Division
where they worked steadily, without taking time out for lunch
or dinner until approximately 9:00 p.m., developing the
necessary information and documents responsive to the AG's
request.

Miss Winslow and Miss Dodge, secretaries in the
Intelligence Division, along with Miss Simmons and Mrs, Weldon,
typists in the Intelligence Division, reported for work at
approximately 11:00 a.m. These 4 young ladies worked contin-
uously through the afternoon and well into the evening hours
preparing the necessary communications for the AG. Not only
did they perform in an admirable fashion but they exhibited
an outstanding attitude and suffered considerable physical
exhaustion prior to their departure for the day at approximately

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

10:00 p.m. Without the outstanding performance of these
4 young ladies, it would have been impossible for this
Division to meet the AG's deadline.

It is interesting to note that the Intelligence
Division was successful in meeting the deadline and had
the necessary material available for the AG at 9:00 a.m.,
on the morning of 10/6/75.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. In view of the outstanding manner in which
L. Patricia Simmons, Christine A. Weldon, Gerry L. Winslow
and Mary E. Dodge performed, it is recommended that each
receive a letter of commendation from the Director.

2. That a general letter of commendation be sent
the Assistant Director, Intelligence Division, for the manner
in which Bureau supervisors in the Intelligence Division
performed and that a copy of that general letter be designated
for the personnel files of those Bureau supervisors mentioned
in the first paragraph of this memorandum.

“Et, Gen. P. A, del Valle
41 Cornhill Street
Annapolis, Maryland

34 September, 1961

*When a free and sovereign people find their elected
‘servants in government, and their appointed advisors, following a
course of action contrary te their cath ef office, destructive
of the Constitution they have sworn to uphold, and leading
rekentiessiy to the loss of their freedom and their sovereignty,
they must perforce take the most effective action to restore sane,
constitutional government, or perish as a free and sovereign people,

“A government that aids and abets the enemies of freedom
at home and abroad; recklessly spends the substance of the nation
in the purchase of votes and in the pursuit of a pro-communist
policy; punishes patriots who dare defy the communist enemy they
are trying to shield, while giving positions of power and pelf
to those traitors who give aid and confort te this enemy; employs
the power of the press and all other communications media to
deceive the peoplé as to their real aims and objectives; behaves
as though this nation were already but a province of the illegally
joined United Nations; is willing or unable to meet the constant
flow of crises provided by an arrogant enemy, yielding piece by |
piece the entire world into their ruthless hands; shows every sign
of having yielded their powers to an unseen, irresponsible and
thoroughly rapacious government within the government; then even
the bread and circuses no longer can hold the people in check,
They must take matters into their own hands and force the traitors
out of power and oblige their elected representatives to honor
their oath of office, : :



DL 100-0 art n

"in such case there are several course of action open
to the people, Political organization to vote out the traitors
and yote in the patriots is one. Pressure by personal appeals,,
petitions, letters and telegrams is another, But the time cones

. when the enemy, feeling strong and secure enough, shamelessly

| igneres these efforts ef the people, and makes ready to replace
constitutional government with socialistic tyranny openly and
quickly. Then there is yet anether course of action left: The
‘ organization of a powerful, armed resistance force to defeat the
‘aims of the usurpers and bring about a return of constitutional
‘ government. i

"The formation of such a nation-wide force, under the

Second article of the Bill of Rights, and for the legitimate
purpose of preventing a2 communistic takeover of their beloved
country, With the to.al loss of their freedom, cannot fail to
bring into being again that sovereignty which, under our form of
government, is based upon the people, Government rules by the
consent of the governed, and, when the governed refuse further to
consent to keing betrayed, then beware! Those in government who
have been Loyai need have ne fear, But when the day comes that

“ the people, in the exercise of their constitutional rights and
sovereignty once more take up arms as they did in 1776, then must
the traiters take flight. .For the wrath of a free and mighty
people, a Ged fearing people, against atheistic tyrants can be
terrible and swift, i pray te Ged that ceurses one and twe will
Burrfice, but if they de not, then 4 pray to Ged that this last
instrumentality be given His grace toe discharge our obligation to
defend those sacred rights He, and He alone, gave unto us."

until they saw ROBINSON had been taken off by police officers.

Date ___6/25/63

JIMMY GEORGE ROBINSON, 200 Second Avenue, Garland, Texas,
was interviewed and furnished the following signed statement:

"Garland, Texas
June 24, 1963

"I, Jimmy George Robinson, make the following voluntary
statement to James P, Hosty, Jr., and Donald J. Cesare, who have
identified themselves to me as Special Agents of the F.B.I. I.

have been advised that this statement may used in a court of
law. No force, threats, or promises were uséd to obtain this
statement.

"I was born June 24, 1938, Bonham, Texas, I completed
eighth grade in school.

“On June 20, 1963, I was arrested by the Garland, Texas,
police for assaulting my wife, Pauline Robinson. I was arrested
at 9:35 AM, and released at 2:00 PM. & later learned from my
half brother Donald Kaiser that at about 1:30 PM, two Garland
police officers and one Garland detective, names ” unknown, accoupanted
_ my wife to our residence at 200 Second Aves, Garland, Texas. a
“The Garland Police then searched my office and removed
some of my literature I had concerning racial integration and the
dewish conspiracy. They also took my membership list for the
National States Rights Party. I am the organizer for the National
States Rights Party in the Dallas, Texas, area,

"My office is a separate building behind my house. The
National States Rights Party rents this office from me for one
dollar a month. Wy wife had no right to let the police search
this office as it was not under her control, My membership list
was returned, but they kept my literature. They also took pictures
of my office and some of the signs I had.

"{ feel that my civil rights have been violated because

the Garland Police searched the office of National States Rights
Party, of which I am the head in the Dallas area, without my consent.

sungecr: Attorney General's February 27, 1975 Testimony ~-
regarding FBI Operations

In his February 27, 1975 testimony before. the Edwards
i Committee regarding FBI information-gathering practices, the
i Attorney General gave certain assurances, most of which seem to
j= be addressed by the FBI guidelines. These include assurances
| that:
i

1. An examination would be made of the practice. of
coilecting information on individuals, _including Congressmen
r (Tr. p. 6). i

. 2. An Become would be made to devise a procedure to
. sereen unsolicited materials to be retained by the FBI, or
to periodically review them to determine whether they’ should
be retained (fr. 16-17).
|

i

3. Director Kelley and his associates do not maintain
7 files on specific individuals in their offices which might be
considered "dossiers" (Tr. 24). Confixmarion that this remains
-true today might be obtained.

4. Measures would be taken to minimize the opportunity
for the FBI to be misused (Tr. 24).

5. Director Kelley was directed to report to the Attor-
ney General practices or requests to the FBI which are or may
appear to be improper (Ir. 27-28). This direction was repeated
in July, 1975. The FBI documents informing the Bureau of this
. policy should be obtained. Instances in which matters con~
cerning actual or apparent impropriety have been reported to
the Attorney General should be listed.

6. Consideration would be given to an Executive Order
to limit the authority in the White House to make requests
directly to the FBI to a few highly placed White House officials
(Tr, 28).

7. Consideration would be given to the scope and effect
of the Executive Order which requires the FBI to report to the

heads of executive departments and the Civil Service Com-
mission unverified allegations relevent to the character
of government employees (Tr. 29).

8. If the guidelines were complete, the Attorney
General would be delighted to announce them (Tr. 35).

9. Consideration would be given to whether a member _
of Congress should be permitted to review FBI files concern-
ing him not compiled in an investigation authori by statute
and, if he wishes, order the destruction of those files (Tr. 86).

Memorandum .
tO ' The Files DATE? Nov. 25, 1975
FROM ¢ Mark L. Wolf NUW

SUBJECT: Attorney General.’s SSC testimony regarding the FBI --.

Meeting with SSC Staff

- On November 24, 1975 Doug Marvin, Jack Fuller, Mike Shaheen,
Ray Hornblower and I met with John ELLiff and Mark Gittenstein
cs of the SSC staff to discuss the Attorney General's testimony
regarding the FBI now scheduled for December 10, 1975.
ry

The SSC has already had public testimony concerning thes
FBI from its staff and Jim Adams. It plans to have two days
of relevant hearings next week, one on the Fs¢ formant pro-
gram and another on Department of Justice supervision of the
FBI. On the latter subject, the SSC hopes to have as witnesses
former FBI officials Sullivan and DeLoach and former Attorneys
General Rogers, Katzenbach and Clark.

During the week of December 1, 1975, the SSC proposes to
hear public testimoay from’ Williams Ruckxelshaus, Henry Petersen,
and Joseph Califano on FBI domestic intelligence activities,
Clarence Kelley on the impacc certain proposals would have on
the FBI, and the Attorney General on contro g the FBI, The
SSC may also request executive session timony from the Atttor-
ney General on the FBI's activities relating to foreign intelli-
gence.

st

Gittenstein and ELliff described 5 areas which the SSC would
like to discuss publicly with the Attorney General. These are:

1. The legal authority for FBI domestic intelligence activities,
including whether President Roosevelt had the authority to
initiate the program and, if so, whether his authorization
was properly construed by the FBI.

2, The breadth of the FBI's domestic intelligence operations,
which included women's liberation groups and Martin Luther
King, and whether the FBI manual or the proposed guidelines
would permit activities directed against such groups today
or in the future. ars, nFORMATION CONTAINED

Whether "preventive action" is‘ ever appropriate and, if so,
how it should be controlled. :

\ :
Whether the Department, the President or Congress has given

“ the FBI adequate guidance on what individuals or groups

constitute internal security threats with which it should

be concerned and whether there is regular review by anyone

to reevaluate the current danger presented by an individual
or group previously designated as an internal security threat.

Whether guidance given to the FBI is being followed and how
this can be assured. Related qrvustions include whether the
FBI can properly investigate itself, whether the Department
of Justice should have an Inspector General, and wrether GAO

should be involved in regularly auditing FBI activities.

In the course of discussion, E1liff and Gittenstein alluded

several other’‘questions which might be raised. These include:

Should internal security activities be permitted et ell, or
can what ELLiff£ called the “Stone Standard” be readopted?

The question raised by the Martin Luther Keag case of what
degree of suspected or actual connection with a foreign
government should be required to trigger surveillance or
investigation of a domestic group? How should “infiltration”
be defined? ‘

How does a domestic intelligence investigation differ from
a criminal investigation and can the differences be justified?

Should there be a statute explicitly authorizing and limit-
ing domestic intelligence activities? If so, what should be
authorized?

What happens to information compiled in the course of unlaw-
ful surveillances or activities initiated on the basis of
reasonable beliefs which prove to be unfounded?

ELLif£ asked whether the proposed FBI guidelines could be dis-

tributed to members of the SSC and used as a basis for discussion
at the hearings. We indicated we would consider this request.

Questions suggested by FBI testimony of SSC 7
Staff and Jim Adams.

Mike Shaheen's office is preparing a synopsis of the
testimony regarding the FBI presented on November 18 and 19,
1975 by the SSC staff and Jim Adams. In my view, the staff
testimony suggests several areas of interest to the SSC, listed
below, which may be discussed with the Attorney General when
he testifies.

1. The SSC questions the value of investigation and sur-
veillance of domestic groups believed to be extremist or sub-
versive, According to its staff, the GAO attempted to evaluate
these activities (Tr. 1605). They found that of 675 cases
reviewed, only 16 had been referred for prosecution; hikes ting
in 4 convictions. in addition, in only 12 of these.ccses did
the GAO find "that the FBI gained any advance inowledge of
planned activities, and 51 percent of those cases revealed no
association with objectionable organizations or no illegal
objectionable activities"(Tr. 1605). Thus, the staff concludes
that surveillance of domestic groups has had little prosecutorial
or intelligence value and questions whether such activities shoulda
ever be conducted in view of the costs and risk of abuse they :
involve.

2, The ssc staf f£ believes that important FBI documents
were included in the "personal files" of J. Edgar Hoover which
were destroyed after his death (Tr. 1608). They believe that
Hoover had reviewed the personal files lettered A to C and
transferred some official documents from these to the OC files.
However, files lettered D through Z were not reviewed in this
manner and the staff presumes that some official documents were
lost when these files were destroyed. The SSC believes that
the FBI unintentionally gave the Attorney General an incom-
plete report on this matter which suggested that no FBI docu-
ments were destroyed. This report was later transmitted to

’ the SSC.

Nw ssior-

3. Senator Tower believes that attention should be paid
to the use of informants, a form of information-gathering which
does not require judicial or Department of Justice approval
(Tr. 1617).

4, ‘Interest has been expressed in whether the counter-
espionage and internal security functions of the Bureau should
be separated within the FBI or handled by different organiza-
tions to reduce the risk that techniques appropriate to counter-
septonage will be “improperly employed against domestic groups

Tr. 1636). : .

5. The 1971 FBI doevment ending Cointellpro stated that
"In exceptional instances where it is considered counter-
intelligence action is warranted, recommendation should be
submitted to the Bureau under the individual case caption" (Tr.
1651). Thus, it may be asked whether there have been any such
requests since 1971 and, if so, whether any were aprpoved.

6. The SSC staff believes that the history of the "Security
Index" is an excellent example of the problems of oversight and
relationships between the FBI, the Department and: Congress
(Tr. 1663).

7. In 1973 the FBI asked the Department to seek statu~
tory ‘authorization for domestic intelligence ectivities and
such authority has not to date been sought (Tr. 1675).

8. The FBI procedure of reporting by an "INLET" letter
dividuals
was discontinued because there were better means of communicating
"dirt" to headquarters for dissemination to the White House

(Tr. 1707). This raises the question of whether agents are
still expected to furnish such informacion to headquarters

and, if not, when it was stcpped. If it has not been stopped,
what type of information is now forwarded and what is done with
it? - 7

this was, to be effective, they felt it should be secret. But

I teld them we played no favorites, but that I naturally
knew personally what papers and reporters were favorably
disposed tovard the Bureau and which were prejudiced against
us and that this was in wy mind in dealing with the press.
I stressed te them that we always strictly followed the
iLtterney General's guidelines on vhot could und cnuid not
be given te the news media on criminal cases and that only
information of a strictly public source nature was ever
given te any newsman in other types of cases. I carefully-
explained to them vhat public source information is and
differentiated it from information developed by intervieus,
or information from informants or seurces, or information
gotten through other investigative techniques. I also
stressed tn them that ve never withheld frem any newspaper,
reporter, radio or television network any information
which they had a right te know about, no matter hw
antagonistic or anti-FBI the paper, television or radia
netiuark or the reporter might be.

they wanted me te justify each of the memoranda. I pointed
nut te them that they did nat originate im the Ci and that
i, therefore, did net think that it was up ta me to justify
ther. I pointed ut that the role of the CD vas ta merely
serve as a eendult ta get the information prepared by the
DIN te the reporter, that. the infermation te be passed by
us te a reperter vas compiicd by the OSD and that che
approval of the action propnsed by the memeranda was in
most cases completed before the memoranda even came to us.
ZI also peiated out that, in each of the mempranda they
showed me, the information te be passed to the press vas

of a strictly public source nature and that none of the
infarmatien cauld be considered confidential.

They shoved me a Int of memoranda prepared by the
DID under this program which also recommended giving certain
information to certain reporters about selected individuals
and groups. I told then that, as far as the Civ vas
concerned, these were handied the same as thnse uncer the
Vass Uedla Program and that all of my replies and explanations
under that caption (abnve} also applied to this program.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR THOMAS E. BISHOP
BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

NOTE:

Mr. Bishop's report of the interview was set
out in his personal letter of 12/4/75 to Supervisor Seymor
Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project. Mr. Bishop asked
that the letter be carefully edited, This was done to
omit those portions which were irrelevant to the interview
or were personal comments to Mr. Phillips. In those
instances where it was unclear as to whether Mr. Bishop
was reporting what he said during the interview or was
merely commenting parenthetically, the portions were also
omitted, Legal Counsel memorandum to Mr, J. B. Adams
11/28/75 captioned '"'Senstudy 75" prepared by PVD:dkg
recommended releasing Bishop from any existing employment
agreements for purposes of the SSC interview.

In his letter to Mr, Phillips, Mr, Bishop, under
that portion captioned "The Ehrlichman Teletype," also
wrote, ", . . this was the matter in which Pat Grey tried
to shaft me by telling the newspapers that the handling of
this matter had been done by me without authority, without
the approval of my superiors. The truth of the matter was
that I had objected to Mark Felt that the Bureau shouldn't
even handle this, I had been specifically ordered to initiate
action on it by Felt and that Felt, David Kinley and
Pat Gray had ali approved the handling of it. Of course,
when 'Life’ Magazine printed a critical stery about it,
then Gray started to get scared and tried te dump the blame
onme, I challenged him on it quite vigorously and, in fact,
this was the thing that finally made me realize that I
should retire from the Bureau because Gray was playing
politics and using the Bureau to do so."

purpose of a staff interview by that Committee relating to
the operations of the Crime Records Division and the "mass

address for Mr. Bishop and was going. to contact him immediately.
Rhea indicated that the current intentions of the Committee
are to have Cartha DeLoach testify on the 3rd of December
publicly before that Committee and they desired to interview

released from existing employment agreements for purposes of the
interview by that Committee. Additionally, he was informed

San Diego, Cale
December 4, 1975

Mr. Seymour Phillips
PBI
Washington, DC

Dear Seymour:

In accordance with your request, I am going to try
to set down -- very briefly -- some of the items dealt with during
my appearance before the Senate Select Committee én Intelligence
Avtivities on December 2, 1975. I am a very poor typist and can't
possibly remember all the matters discussed with me, so you will
have to bear with me.

First of all, I was sworn in by Sen. Schweiker, who
only stayed for a very brief time. I was interviewed fro® 9AM
to a bout 5 PM, with Gordon Rhea, Assistant to the Chie Counsel,
Frederick Baron, Assistant to the Chief Counsel, and Barbara
Banoff, Counsel, present during the entire questioning, and with
Joseph diGenoza, Counsel, participating during the morning session,
and John Eliff, Head of the Domestic Task Force, participating
in the afternoons

Let me say at the outset that it was a pretty grueling
experience, not because I veouldn't handle the questions they
threw at me, but because of the sheer length of the session and
because I had absolutely no prior knowledge of what memos, docu~
ments, etc they were to throw at me. I do think that the Bureau does
a disservice to former employees who have been out of the’ Bureau
for some time and who have to appear before the Commityee, by not
giving them some idea of the areas of questioning that will be 2mm
faced with and some clues as to what o1d4 memos, ete thay will be
called upon to explain.

Now, getting back to my questioning --- they first
wanted me to give them a detailed acsount of just what duties the
Crime Records Division performed. This included every function
performed by the Front Office, as well as each and every thing that
each of the Sctions dud did. They were particularly interested
in the handling of press matters -- whether we played any favorites
among papers in giving out news stories, exactly what type of in-
formation we gave out to the press, etc. Naturally , I told them
we played no favorites but that I naturally knew personally what
papers and reportes were favorably disposed toward the Bureau and
which were prejudiced against us and that this was in my mind
in dealing with the press. I stressed to them that we always
strictly followed the ATgornoy General's Guidelines on what
could and could not be given to the news media on criminal cases
and that only information of a-strietly public source nature was
ever given to any newsman in other types of cases. I carefully
explained to them what public source data is and diffdrentiated
it from information developed by interviews, or info from
informahts or 3

techniquese I also stressed to them that we never withheld
from any newspaper, reporter, radio or TV network any info
which they had a right to know about no matter how antagonistic
or anti-FBI the paper, TV or radio ntework er the reporte
might be.

Now getting to some of the topics which they went into
in depth.
MASS MEDIA PROGRAM_

The showed me dozens of memos pfepared by the Dom. Intell.
Divs under this program , all of which recommended that the Crime
Records Div. give info to xmm selected newspapers or publications
which info reflected unfavorably on certain individuals or
organizations. Many of these memos related to M.L. King, other
racial leaders , and racial organbzations. It was obvious that
they didn't think much of this program and thought of it as
harrassment. Theu wanted me to justify each of the memos. I pointed
out to them that they d&d not originate in the Crime Records
Div. and that I therefare did not think that it was up to me to
justify them. I pointed out the the role of the Crime Reoords Div
was to merely serve as a conduit to get the infowation prepared
by the Dom Intell Div to the reporter, that the infomation
to be passed by us to a reporter was compiled by the Dom Intell
Div and that the approval of the action proposed by the memos
was in most gases completed before the memo even came to use I
also pointed out that, in each of the memos thaey showed me, the
information to be passed to the press was of a strictly public
source nature, and that none of the information could be considered
confidential

_SONINTELPRO

They showed me a lot of memos prepared by the Dom Intel
Div under this program which also recommended giving certain info
to certain reporters abour selected individuals and groups. I told
them that, as far as the Crime Records Div was connerned, these
wore handled the same as these under the Mass Media Program and
that all of my replies and explanations ubder that captkon (above)
also applied to this programe

DO Not coNTACT List

They wanted to know all about the handling of this.
I told them , and also explained there was nothing sinister about
it and that it was merely to keep our agents from wasting their
time contacting people during investigations who had clearly
indicated that they did not wish to be contacted, and also to keep
our agents from being insulted or vilified repeatedly by people £
who made a prac tice of doing this whenever contacted by an Agent.
They seemed satisfied tht the DNA list was in no was a " Blacklis?"

v SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS LIST

I had to explain this in detail -- its purpose, how'a
person got included on the list, num what publications, etc, were
sent to péople on the list, etc. It appeared my explanations satis-
fied them.

WHITE HOUSE NAME CHECKS

This was gone into pretty thonpughly. In answer to a
question, I told them that we generally knew from the list of names
on which checks were being asked what was the reason for the name
check request (because the list whuld generally indicate a date on
which a function was being held at the White Housw to whieh the x
people on the list had been invited; I told them, however, that we
would still handle the name check even tuuxa though we did not
know why it was requested . They tried to make something out of that
but gave up after I pointed out how ridiculous it would be if the
FBIrefused to give the President a summary of data in a our files
on a person unless he first told us why he wanted ite

CONGRESSIONAL FILES

I had to give them a detailed explation of this -- what
info we collected from the field offices on newly elected Con-
gressmen and Senators, what we did with the info, what we used it
for, etc. I frankly thought that they would go into this in even
more detail than they did. They seemed to back off from it when
I explained that the chief purpose of the Congressional Files was
to assist me in handling liaison with the Senate and House-= that
I wamted to know which Congressmen and Senators were crooks, lushes,
libertines, etc because I certainly wouldn't trust anyone like
that. I said I could give them some specific, horrible examples,
but they didn't want me to put the names on the records

LEONARD BOUIN

He was the attornelf for Dr, Spock during the latter's
trial. He has a long history of CP’ associations . During the trial
a memo was written setting out all the public source data known

on him and it was recommended that it be given to a friendly newsr
mene They wank ted to know why this was proposed, whether the info
was in fact given to a newsman at that time, and if we made a
practice of giving out derogatory data on attorneys for defendants
in Bureau caseSe I told them we mist have been asked for public
source data by a newsman and that's why the memo was writteny I also
showed them nokations written on the mmamo which specifically
prohibited tha data beibg given out while the trial was in progres
or even until after all appeals in the Spock case were concluded.



THE BRLIGHMAN TELETYPE

While I was being interviewed, the Admknistrative Assistant
to Sen. Phillip Hart, called the staff and asked that I be
requested to make a detailed statement on the record concerning the
above matter. I was delighted to dom so because xmaks,/ this was
the matter in which Pat Gray tried to shaft me by telling the
newspapers thst the handling of this matter had been done by mo
without authority, without the approval of my superiors. The :
truth of the metter wask that I had objected to Mark Felt that
the Bureau shouldn't even handle this, I had been specifically
ordered to initiate action on it by Felt, and that Felt, David &x
Kinley and Pat Gray had all apppuwed the handling of it. of
course, when ‘Life’ Magazine printed a critical story about it, then
Gray started to get scared and tried to dump the blame on me. I
challenged him on it quite vigoréusly and, in fact, this was the 8
thing that finally made me realize that I should retiBe from
the Bureau because Gray was playing politics and usin@ the Bureau
to do soel Anyway, I put on the record a deatiled explanation
of the hahdling of this matter and clearly placed the respon-
sibility for 1t where it belonged. The reason Sew Hart wanted to /}
get my side of it’on the record is because Gray, during his con- rf

(}

firmation hearing, had tried to slip and dodge questions about
this and Sen Haft thought he may have come close to perjurye

of the Situation. In doing so, I must admit, I took advantage of

the situation to get on the record several times my description

RE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING
THIS BUREAU'S OPERATION OF INFORMANTS
IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

He DH
'

Reference is made to SSC Letter dated Novenber 7,
197%, requesting a wenorandum on this Bureau's operation of
informants in the internal secuxity field.

An informant, according te the dictionary, is
“ene who gives information.” In light of this definition,
ait is clear that very few persons, if any, have not at one
time or another been informants. To give information is an
inseparable part of life. To give accurate, sound and
helpful infornation for a worthy cause is to make one's
iife more useful and valuable to society.

informants of the FBI are persons who furnisa
necessary and vital information~-inforaation which is used
as 2 means of attaining justice. Inforaants clear the
innocent as well as convict the yuilty. They serve of their
own free will. None are forced. Informants are as oid as
the human race. Their use is international. History is
studded with many and varied examples of the uses of intoraonts.
No government or organized society has been without thea.

ENGQ NOLUVEDUOZND TT

informants provide one of the best and most complete
forms of coverage to the Law enforcement, officer, Sonetimes
they are the only means of penetrating subversive or extrenist

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTER TO STUDY GOVIRNMENTAL :
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TQ INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (esc) i

The developuent of informants is one of the most
difzieult, unique and specialised assignments, bespite
the obstacles encountered in informant development, Bureau
Agents have met and aro continuing to méet with steady and
remarkable successes, They regularly denonstrate vision,
daring and commendable resourcefulness in this work. The
Bureau today we believe has the best informant coverage in
its history.

When information is received or developed that a
person has background qualitications indicative of informant
potential, in an area where coversse is needed, a ease is
opened, Office and Headquarters indices are reviewed and
other logical discreet checks are made, including canvass of
Logical sources, to prelinimarily establish the individual's
background, reliability, stability and integrity. Tf the
preliminary checka are favorable, the individual would be
interviewed to establish a personal assessment by a
Special Agent as to the person's qualifications, potential,
and willingness to assist this Bureau, if the interview is
positive, additional background investigation is conducted
to establish the persons reliability, stability, and
integrity. Upon satisfactory coupletion of this investigation,
the individual besins a developucot period with the handking
Agent and after establishing a proven record of reliability,
Penman d and productiveness, becones a Headquarters approved

niormant.

The Bureau's informants, particularly in the internal
security field, have many restrictions imposed upon their
relationship with the Bureau. For example, they are impressed
with the confidential nature of their relationship with the
EBE, that their actions are strictiy voluntary and that they
are not employees, ff they are connected in any way with a
labor union, they are informed that the Bureau is not
interested in an employee-euployer relationship or if
connected with an institution of learning, they are specifically
advised that the Bureau is not interested in the legitimate
activities of educational institutions, In paxyticular, all
informants are instructed to avoid knowledze of defense plans
and strategy or discussion thereof with attorneys, subjects
or other individuals in any prosecution arising from intelligence
or ¢riminal investigations. In the event an informant is
unable to avoid obtaining such information, this inforaation

is not to be reported te the FBI, A signed statement, if
possible, is obtained from each informant so that the informant
is aware of the Buresi's position in these matters. {A copy
of head signed statenent appears herein as Attachment number
one.

Fron the time Snecial Agents enter New Agent's
Class they are indoctrinated and trained in the legal
aspects of the Bureau's work as well as the scope and
linits of their authority, The Manual of Rules and
Regulations spécifically addresses the conduct of Special
Agents in their investigative duties, (See Manual of Rules
and Regulations Attachnent number two.) Training
eontinues in their offices of assignment, each office having
n Legal Officer available for training, consultation and
guidance, Frequent, extensive In-Service retraining
programs further bolster the Special Agents' knowledge and
utilization of the law in the conduct of their official
duties. Specifically, informant development and handling
are extensively discussed in the FRE's training programs
and there is no quéstion as to Special Agents being aware
that informants cannot be directed to perform a function
that the Special Agent may not legally perform. Special
Agents are particularly reminded of the need to be alert
to plants, potential agent provocateurs to be used against
haw enforcement in a variety of ways, sO as to avoid
unfounded allegations of impropriety which may jeopardize
investigations or prosecutions as well as result in highly
publicized contrived incidents reflecting adversely on
Law enforcement. :

Hany of our informants furnish needed and valuable
information on a gratuitous basis, Many are also paid for
their services. Payments to informants are one of the most
highiy supervised areas within Bureau operations, When
@ paynent is made to an informant, the handling Agent must
make a vealintic determination as to the value of theservices
performed by the informant, Established Bureau procedure
requires that payments made to informants, upon recommendation
of handling Agent and approval of appropriate supervisory
personnel, originate fron the office Field Support Account
and ate drawn fron this account by check made out to the
handling Agent for the amount authorized. The handling

Agent cashes the check at a local bauk and then pays the
informant the authorized anount in cash for which a receipt
is received from the informant and maintained in FBI

files, Although there is no overall memorandum of instruction
ov document dealing with cost effectiveness as it relates to
ainforuants, this factor is considered by the Spedel Accent
handling the infornant, Lis supervisor, and the Special Agent
an Charge. Payments to informanta ior services are made
commensurate with the value of information furnished and

for actual expenses incurred in connection with obtaining
information for the RBI. Recommendations concerning

payments to informants on a regular basis receive careful
consideration at Headquarters leyel, After analysis and
couparison with paynents currently being made to other
ainforaants operated under similar circumstances and providing
sinilar-typge information, outhority ig extended at Headquerters
to pay informants for services and expenses within prescribed
Limits, When payments are authorized by Headquarters, it

is the personal responsibility of each Special Agent in
Charge to definitely assure that full value is being received.
His review is on an individual basis wherein he evaluates the
information received aud the amount being recomaended by

the handling Agent for poyuent for thin specific inforaation,
Additionally, instructions provide that each Cpyecial Agent

in Charge is to insure that all pending informant files

are reviewed personally by appropriate supervisory personnel
on @ veguiar periodic basis not to exceed a period of GO days,
This review includes, but is not limited to, assurance that
full value has been received for ali payments made to
informants, Also the entire informant prosran is subject

to annual review by our Inspection Staff which pkysicaliy
exanines inforuant files to assure that they are beiny
handled properly and that payments are being uade
commensurate with the value of information received,

In addition to the above controle and restrictions
information furnished from informants is constantly :
sifted, analyzed, recorded and disseminated, The infernation
is verified where possible through other sources and
individual investigation, A system of checks is constantly
involved to prevent an informant from producing erroneous
anformation by accident or design.

Coneerning warrants, a warrant requirement for |
the use of informants appears impractical and way be |
unconstitutional. Ft is impractical because probable cause
usually is not availabie when the informant technique is |
initiated and the submission of an affidavit in opplication
fox a warrant would increase the hazard of exposure of the
infornant's identity. Such a Jiwitation might be unconstitutional
because it would limit the First Amendnent rights of the
informant to communicate with the Government, Existing legal
restrictions require guided informants to recognize the sane
legal limitations ag would be applicable, in the sane circun- |
stances, to those directing the informants. An informant can
Legally do no more than an Agent is permitted tea do.

The Bureau in the domestic intelligence area has under
investigation oxganizations, most of which have nuuerous districts,
regions, offices, sections, chapters and clubs. These organiza-
tions and their subdivisions total over 1100, which receive |
investigative attention to some extent, These investigations |
aye afforded coverage by less than 1160 internal security

Acs noted, the Bureau’s utilization of informants
involves a bigh degree of care and supervision, ft is a
specific Bureau policy that an informant may only be
tergeted against individuals or organizntions of investigative
interest to the PBI, Et must be recognized, however,
inforuants furnish a wealth of related information which
cones to their attention during the course of theiy assigned
duties. While operating against assigned targets, the
associations necessary to maintain credibility may Lead to

informants provided information which led directly to

3. illegal Activities
Illegal activities on the part of any employee, in addition to being
unlawful, reflect on the integrity of the FBI and betray the trust and
confidence placed in it by the American people. Furthermore, unlawful
activities can disqualify him for employment by the Government of the
United States. It is, therefore, expected that employees will obey not only
the letter of the law but the spirit of the law as well whether they be
engaged in transactions of a personal or official natures With respect to
investigative activities, this admonition particularly applies to entrap-
ment or the use of any other improper, illegal, or unethical tactics in the
procurement of evidence. In this regard, it should be especially noted that,
in securing information concerning mail matter, the Bureau will not
tolerate a violation of law (Title 18, USC, §§ 1702, 1703, 1708, and 1709).
Furthermore, employees must not tamper with, interfere with, or open mail
in violation of law nor aid, abet or condone the opening of mail illegally
by any employee of the U. S. Postal Service.

As members of a Federal investigative agency, FBI employees must at all
times zealously guard and defend the rights and liberties guaranteed to
all individuals by the Constitution. Therefore, FBI employees must not
engage in any investigative activity which could abridge in any way the
rights guaranteed to a citizen of the United States by the Constitution

- and under no circumstances shall employees of the FBI engage in any con-
duct which may result in defaming the character, reputation, integrity,
or dignity of any citizen or organization of citizens of the United States.

Employees must not install secret telephone systems or microphones without
Bureau authority.

No brutality, physical violence, duress or intimidation of individuals by
our employees will be countenanced nor will force be used greater than
that necessary to effect arrest or for self-defense.
