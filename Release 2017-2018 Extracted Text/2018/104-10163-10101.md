MEMORANDUM
MEMORANDUM
Miant,May 8,1961,

A situation of unrest and dissatisfaction vhich appeared within the 10C :
before the invasion has apparently come to a head. :
It originated when four members of the six Executives of the F,R.D. united - :
vader the Generational T-esis, This provoked a erisis within the FRD and all : !
of Atta components organizations. ! ;
It appeared at the time that Rasco would be substituted by the Executive
“ Committes within Cubs, The ilant Comittee of the HDC backed Rasco, This si~

tuation was solved at the tine by a trip here to Miami, taken by Incas, the : 7
Goordinator of the MDC in Cuba, and at the same time, General Coordinator of
the FRD.

Tn a personal conversation with Lucas, he informed me that they vere not 7
satisfied with Rasco, but that he agreed that it was not the time for @ subs-
tituiion within the MOC with detriment to this organization, the FRD and the
general Revolutionary effort, At thie time Lucas mentioned Fermin Peinado and
Melchor Gaston as possible: substitutes. 7 |

The non inclusion of an MIG menber in the Revolutionary Council, produced
@ further discontent within this organization, not withstanding the inference
of ¥iré Cardona of amplifying the Council within Cuba, which implied that Lucas,
the MDC Coordinator, would be a member of the Council. : {

in the last few days several maneuvers have taken place within the MC and
although at first 14 arnenred thet Metsher Gaston-vould eubstituts Rasao, > 1
now weems that Fermin Peinado has the majority of the votes, within the Zxecu-— |

Th should be noted that this is being done in the Mani Executive that
had previously backed Rasco, with the apparent consent of the Movement within
Cuba.

The Jesuit Society, which originally created the MDC in Cuba, has not
interfered in this development, but apparently prefers Melchor Gaston to
Fermin Feinado.

Rasco has been critized within his organization for appearing in the
newspapers with a "beard".
