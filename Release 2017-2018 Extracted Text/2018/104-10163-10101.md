MEMORANDUN

Miani, Say 8,1961.

A situation of unrest and dissatisfaction which appeared within the MC

before the Invasion has apparently come to a head.

It originated when four nembers of the six Executives of the F.R.D. united

under the Generational Tesis. This provoked a crisis within the FRD and all

of it's componente organizations.

It appeared at the time that Rasco would be substituted by the Executive

Committee within Cuba. The Ilami Committee of the MDC backed Rasco. This si-

tuation was solved at the time by a trip here to Maml, taken by lucas, the

Coordinator of the MDC In Cuba, and at the sane time, General Coordinator of

the FRD.

In & personal conversation with lucas, he Inforned me that they were not

satisfied with Rasco, but that he agreed that it was not the time for a subs

tituiion within the MC with detriment to this organisation, the FRD and the

general Revolutionary effort. At this time Lucas mentioned Fermin Peinado and

Melchor Gaston as possible substitutes.

The non Inclusion of an MDC menber in the Revolutionary Council, produced

a further discontent within this organization, not ulthstanding the Inference

of Kiró Cardons of amplifying the Council within Cuba, which Implied that Lucas,

the HDC Coordinator, would be a member of the Council.

In the last few daya several maneuvere have taken place within the MC and

although et first 1t annanred thet Malphor Gaeten sould cubstitute Rasso, ''"-

sow weens that Fermin Pelnado han the majority of the votes, within the Execu

tive of the MC. An Ireoutive meeting of the MC 1a soheduled for today at

five and a General Assembly to-nite at 8 o'clock and a decision should be pro-

duosd In the Gonoral Assembly.

It should be noted that this in being done in the Mani Executive that

had previously backed fasco, vith the apparent consent of the Kovement within

Cuba.

The Jesult Society, which originally created the DC in Cuba, has not

Interfered In this development, but apparently prefera Melchor Gaator to

Fermin Feinado

Raseo has been critized within his organization for appearing in the

newspapers with a "beard"
