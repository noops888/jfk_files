___Possible Utilization of AMICE-14 in Student Activities

PRIORITY

1. SUMMARY. ‘This dispatch contains a proposal for the re=
location of a highly competent, trained, experienced JNWAVE
agent, ANICE-14, to another WH area where he could be utilized
in student activities while completing his educational credits
for a law degree. Subject'’s effectivencss can no longer be fully
utilized in the DMWAVE area; it is proposed that his unique
training and qualifications may be of utilization to another

KUBARK Station.°

: 2. JMWAVE Station is currently utilizing a principal agent,
ANICE=14, who appears to be particularly well-qualified for use
in student activities in a Latin Arerican university. AMICE-14
has been a JMVAVE agent since February 1953. Prior to his being

recruited by the Station, he had nade ten clandostine trips into

7 Cuba. In the year and a half since His “¥ ‘UIttent, he has made
five more clandestine trips-uncer Station direction. We has re-
ceivod extensive FI and’ PM training. ie has recruited a number
of agents for the Station, both inside and outside o2 Cuba, up to
and dncluding one high-ranking oZ¢icer in the present Cuban
Governnent, He has shown outsta: ding ability anc initiative in
wll these activities. Unfortunately, 4-14 is now cu knowledgeable
of several interlocking operations cu ntly. teeing inside
Cuba, due to his direct participation the: jects, that
ULMVAVE can no longer continue to allow A-14 to make any further

black infiltrations, despite bis strong desire to continue doing

so. A-14 has been told that for the protection of tke internal

assets he must make no furthor infiltrations.

3... Due to the above rentioned restricti on A-l4's
netivities, and to his stronz rotivation to continue actively
to participate in fighting Castrois=/Conmunis:, it is felt
that his greatest contribution could be made in the studeat
ficld in Latin Acerica. Subject studied alzost four yoorsat
the University of Mavana, aiming for a law degree. It is con-
siderce that ke would need at least twé ycars tore of study to
obtain his decree at another university. Subject is of wiite
nisi extraction and might pass as a native of nnothor Latin
cuustry. He comes from a fornerly well-to-do educated fanily
fron the upper clas’ of Cuban society. Transnittcd as Attach-
nent #5, Under Séparate Cover, is a copy of P2Q Part I on Sub-

MORANDUS FOR THE RECORD cpisite bar

SUBJECT: Assessment for Future KUBARK
Utilization, ANICE-14

1. ANICE-14 was recruited in arch 1963 for the AXTRUXK project
which is concerned primarily with MIAPRON activities. In Octeber 1963,
ANICE-14 became the P/A of the ANTR team and concurrently Team
Leader. He has 6 other Ax under his supervision. AXICE-14 con-
tinued in this dual capacity until June 1964 when he was told that he
would not be permitted to.re-infiltrate in the near future. During the
course of five infiltration operations over the past year and ais day-
to-day duties as Principal Agent between operations, AXICE-l4 has be~
cone thoroughly familiar with the objectives and accomplishments of the
ANTRUNK operation--and concurrently, to a lesser degree, with a parallel
MHAPRON operation (AMLASH)--to the point where his capture inside could
result in the-complete collapse of both projects. This latest develop-
ment in which his activities have been confined to the continental
limits of PBPRIME is‘ strictly:against AMICE-14's wishes. As stated
above, AMICE-14 has participated in five clandestine infiltration opera=
tions under KUBARX sponsorship and in another ten before he became con-
nected with KUBARK. The five missions met with varying degrees of
success but in each ANICE-14 showed an uncommon amount of personal
bravery tempered with a realistic application of the principles of
clandestine operations. His performance in these operatiors has also
been marked with a resourcefulness and stick-to-it-iveness which testi~
fy further to the high degree of motivation and personal integrity which
this agent possesses. f

2. ANICE-14 is 27 years old, married, and has three children from
four years of age to one month. He comes from a family of professional
people and has himself completed 4 of the necessary 5 years for a_law
degree at the University of Havar While still in Cuba, ANICE-14 was a
student leader in secondary schools in both Matanzas and Havana Provinces
and a member of the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), one of the most active
of the anti-Batista organizations and probably second only to the "26th of
July" in effectiveness. After the revolution, AMICE-14 held responsible
administrative positions in the Provincial Government and in the Bureau
of Motor Vehicles. For a person o: his relatively young age, he has many
close friends in high positions 1.1 the Castro Government.

3. The most remarkable tai. about AMICE-l4 is that re is mature ~
far beyond his years. He has packed a lot of living into 27 years. He
has been a revolutionary since his late teens and so much 07 his Mfe
has been occupied with clandestine activity of some sort thar it is
really the only “trade” he knows. -(Although CE-14 t admit it
except to himself in his weaker moments, tt may be vent to ossible
for him ever to settle down to any kind of normal lite). Many of those
young Cubans who have been fighting first Batista and then Castro with
an honest zeal and dedication are either dead or serving long prison sen~
tences. Few who have been as active as he are still alive or free, What has

personally involved, in an active acity, in the t against

is reluctant to leave the WAVE area and to cease active
Operations aga: t Castro as long as his services are needed. He
has said that he always ended to complete his education sone

day but that his owa and his fanily'"s future will have to wait un-
til Fidel is ousted. With his past experience in student activities
and clancestine operations, he couid be invaluable in the right
Latin American university. However, he intends to think of student
activities as child's play compared to the NHAPRON objectives of
the ANTRUNX project. It is still problematical whether or not he

will accept this proposal. -

8. ANICE-14 speaks adequate English for operational purposes
and for social. coaversation. He understands idiomatic English with
little difficulty. - His written English is poor but both his written
and spoken facility with the languase could be improved with some
tutorial training. He wants to speak proper English and he tries
his best to phrase his sentences gramatically but he, at least in
recent years, is hampered by a lack of formal education in English.
While he conbined both P/A and Tean Leader functions for the
ANTRUNK tean, his case officer did not press hin to provide written
reports. His reports were given verbally to his case officer who
would then prepare-them in English. He has since been given the
use of a typewriter--he had taken a course in typewriting--and his
first report (in Spanish) appears to be thorough and comprehensive.
There is reason why he cannot be developed into a good reporter
because he is very observant and is a keen student of human nature.
He will probably have to be prodded to continue to write but he
has not yet objected to it.

9, In summary, AMICE-14 would be ideal for anti-Consunist
student activities in Latin America--if he wants to give it a try.
This is still only a goal for the i ‘diate future--he cannot be

a student all his life. The biggest challenge is to rind a way to
continue to utilize his talents. Ir all depends on the Cuban
situation. If Fidel’is. ousted, there is an excellent possibility
that some day ANICE-14 may well be a very influential person in a
free Cuban governzent. If the situat.on in Cuba remains status quo
and if a way can be found to “interna.ioralize" his thinking

against Communism as a world menace rather than as the nore localized
personal cancer that Cuban C unis represents to hin at present,

he could continue to be of immense value to KUBARK in other Spanish-
speaking areas for many years.
