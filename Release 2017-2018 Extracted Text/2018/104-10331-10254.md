Dear Ms. Lambert:

this is to acknowledge receipt of your 6 September 1995

Freedom of Intormation Act (FOlA) request tor intormation on

Clay Shaw and in which you ask several questions regarding

named QKENCHANT (OI QXENCHANT...) ."

Clay Shaw's association with the Claplease accept oproject

apology for the length of time it has taken us to respond to

your 6 September letter.

Please be advised that the FOIA does not authorize or

require federal agencies to answer questions on behalf of

requesters, nor does the FOIA require us to perform research

or create records for a requester.

Neither are we required

to study a body of material to see if it is related to a

specific event, activity, or incident or individual.

FOIA provides for public access to reasonably described

records. Documents must be described sufficiently to enable

a professional employee familiar with the subject to locate

documents without an unreasonable amount of effort. This,

with few exceptions, means that the documents must be

locatable through the indexing to our various records

systems.

Notwithstanding the above, we conducted a search of our

database of previously released records and have enclosed

listings obtained under the title Shaw which may be of

interest to you.

This material was located as a result of

previous thorough and diligent searches conducted in our

other records systems on behalf of earlier requesters in

response to FOIA reguests and subsequent litigation for

information on the same subject. No records were located

under the titles @KENCHANT Or @XENCHANT.

As a requester in

the "commercial" category you are entitled to any pages

items you want and return the listings to this office.

Please keep in mind that there may be duplicative documents

and inaccurate page counts.

Therefore, we will advise you of

the total amount due, if any, when we

send you the requested

material.

A copy of our schedule of fees is also enclosed.

Please note that since the FOIA neither authorizes nor

requires us to conduct research on behalf of a requester, it

will be your responsibility to examine the material to

determine if it contains information specific to your

particular concerns.

In addition, please be advised that this Agency's

records on the assassination of President Kennedy have been

reviewed under the less restrictive disclosure provisions of

the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992. These re-reviewed records have been

transferred to the National Archives and Records

Administration (NARA) in compliance with the Act.

These records are currently being re-reviewed by the

Presidentially appointed Assassination Records Review Board

(ARRB) which, in accordance with the Records Collection Act,

has the authority to make new determinations regarding the

release of information. Following review by the Board, these

records are returned to NARA to be made available to the

Therefore, to obtain the most complete versions of

the records you want, you should submit your request to NARA

at the following address:

JFK Assassination Records Collection

National Archives at College Park

We hope we have been of assistance with your request.

Sincerely,
