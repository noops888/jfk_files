SOHN BIRCH SOCEEIY

PRISHECK recetived.the: impression:that: the VEYLs, have disassociated
themselves fromthe Birchites.and have completely severed thelr relationship
with the Society and its:purposes....\They do not see fnu WOLLMAN, a wealthy
man, who is the -Birchitexrepresentative:in-Palm: Beach. WOLLMAN had entertained
the WEYLs frequently. when.they.-first:moved:-to. Florida.

During the: entire-Jength of PRISBECK's visit and as far as she
could judge, the WEYLs:were completely. isolated socially. They have not been
assimilated into the: little.tow.in«which.they live and their only contecS
with the towspeople:is-at:theolubiwhich: they frequent ,. but: seldont.--

wes present. John MARTINO and. Nathaniel WEYL are. co-authnars of the book
"y was Castro's Prisoner”, which was. published in Novenber 1963. PRISBECK
has read it and says it is an'extremely interesting and well written accomt
of MARTINO's imprisomnent in Cuba. 7

PRISBECK, at this.point, cautioned the writer tio remember that

all she was relating regarding. the WEYL's remarks were rumors and/or gossip

VLE

MARTINO and Nathaniel. spoke of a trip that MARTINO hed mde

to Cuba with an American newspaper woman, one LAPIN and two CIA agents.
Nathaniel did not accompany them. It is PRISBECK's opinion that Nathaniel,
who is a coward, just welshed on the trip, but that he afd finance it.
The purpose of the trip was to contact a Cuban who waa serving as lisison
for the four Russian Generals in charge of training and organizing the
Cuban military. The Cuban, who met the group.in the water at the edgs of
@ beach in Cuba, told them that ths.four Generals wanted to escape and
seek asylum in the United States.

MARTINO is going.ahead-with a follow up plan whereby ona given
signal, he and a group will sail to Cuba to pick up the Generals. Nathaniel
is going on a long lecture tour.and will not be-able to accompany the pick
up team to Cuba.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD

: The Cuban friende.of the umamed individual io Miami Imow that
OSWALD contacted the Cuban MI-6 by telephone from a private home in Miami.
They also know the man vho furnished the information on OSWALD to the FBI.

From the reports given by the Cubans to this unknown individnal,
it seems very definite that RUBY went to Habana to mike a shady deal with
@ creature by the name off PRASKINy who works with the Cuben Commmists and
who 1s also tied up with call girls in Cubs.

A friend of Nathaniel WEYL, who ran for the presidency of Cuba
in 1958, shortly will testify before the Senate Internal Security Sub-
Comittee. FRISBECK says this information may be confidential. _ SOURWINE,
of the Conmittee, contacted Nathaniel to get in touch with the individual.

MARINA OSWALD

Nathaniel claims there is more to Marina than meets the eye. He
bas no doubts about her being politically involved and also he thinks that
OSWALD's mother is an old line Commnist, but he cannot prove this belief,

Nathaniel Imows that after OSWALD was refused a visa to the Soviet
Union, he made a quick trip from Mississippi to Cuba. OSWALD returned from
this trip with money and then purchased a car. This story of his trip to Cuba
comes from a girl in Miami with whan he was living when he was in Miami.

Source alse advised that no American may vork in Russia unless he
is a wember of the CPUSA. Naturally, Foreign Service personnel] and private
businessmen on trips are exchuied from this restriction. The Party directs

espionage training scheol was located in Kiev and that this school was still
in existence in this eity in 1937, the last date of contact of Source: with
RIS. Source said it is very likely that the CPUSA.instructed OSWALD to proceed
