on May 1, 1961 in connection with burglary and entering of a
telephone booth, Dallas on February 16, 1961.

On June 23, 1961, DL T-7 advised that wiLLIAM SOLTES,
Dallas bondsman made bond for DOLAN in connection with the
Federal Firearms Act charges pending at Biloxi, Mississippi,
that other bonds which SOLTES has made for DOLAN in ‘the past
have been discharged due to dismissal of process and/or no
bills. It was stated that SOLTES was known to have been in
contact with JOHN. J. FISHER, DOLAN's attorney, and that
FISHER had stated DOLAN had considered leaving Dallas and that
if he did so, SOLTES would be notified.

On July 5, 1961, DL T-4 advised SA JAMES W. BOOKHOUT
that DOLAN, accompanied by FISHER, was known to have paid $30
on an old bond account on that date. According to.DL T-4,
FISHER had related in informant's presence that at the time of
DOLAN's arrest at Gulfport, Mississippi, a stolen golf bag
was found in the car in which he was riding, that local
officers reportedly do not have the golf bag now but FISHER
was concerned as to whether local authorities at Gulfport
intended to file charges against DOLAN in this connection,

It appeared DOLAN desired to avoid arrest on a fugitive
warrant should such charges be filed by arranging bond in
advance. E

On June 9, 1961, DL T-2 advised SA ALFRED D, NEELEY
that JOE RUSSELL WYATT, Dallas Police eR RE ERS Number 30252
had approached NICK CASCIO, FBI #692074/48%q, ‘ort to
determine if they could furnish information concerning any
“hot jewelry" that might be available for purchase. DOLAN
reportedly stated he did not know of any in. Dallas but that
if he was interested he, DOLAN, could put WYATT ia touch with
a party in Phoenix, Arizona.

advised by a female who answered the telephone at the ‘
American Guild of Variety Artists, DOLAN's former employment,

female had "no idea" where DOLAN was presently employed or
where he could be reached.

On April 12, 1961, DL T-2 advised SA ALFRED D. |
