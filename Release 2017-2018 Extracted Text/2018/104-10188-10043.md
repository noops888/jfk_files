4) LIFEAT/CUBAN

LIFEAT coverage of two relatives of AMSTRUT-2 provides an "essential" check

on the activities of AMSIRUT-2, and particular information which aids the in

idicoled sse unficers jan the acual co tacis with AMSTRUT -2 plus the progress

of the AMSTRUT operation.

The valuc of LIFEAT providing an unilateral check

0:1 the activities of AMSFRUT-2 and her rela:ives during critical periois of the

AMSTRUT operation cannot be over emphasizel. Copies of the daily take from

the two lines covered by LIFEAT for the AMSTRUT operation are forerded

iwlee a wick lọ WAVE.

5) LIFEAT/EXILE

LIFEAT information is drawn on heavily both for the presen: harassment campaign

direcied against ESLARD I as well as for daily incelligence of the activities and

contacts of this cargei. Weekly summaries of LIFENT provided material are

cabled direcily to Headquarters and Station Guatemala City.

6) LIFEAT/AMERICAN OOMMUNISTS

As per reference, coverage in this area was resumed on 22 January 1963 with the

return from home leave of the ODENVY processor of these lines.

Travel and

contacis of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM) provided by the

LIFEAT take are of particular interes: to ODENVY.

Only change nored in paragraph 1. A (6) above.

C. LIAISON

Resumption of local liaison with ODENVY as noted in paragrapi l. A (6) above.

D. SECURITY :

[) The installation of new municipal lighring for many areas in Mexico

City noted in refereice continued during january 1963, bur at a reduced scale.

Some areas covered by LIFEAT basehouses are now free of the installation

crewS.

li) Due to the circumstances under wilch most of the LIFENT basehouse

keepers were originally recruited or shifted from other projects to employment

in LIFEAT (in most cases at least ten years ago) they are either avare or have

reason to suspect that they are now, or at one time were, employed sy KiBARK

working out of the local ODACID installation, LIFEAT outside principal agent,

Derid M. WILSTED, (at Siation direction) is making a major and continuing effort

• to orient the LIFEAT personnel toward the idea that there is to presen: contact

with the ODACI insiallation, that WILSTED and Ws/ne C. DRABAND (under alias)

are solely responsible for the operation and that they report direcil to Head-

quarters" in PBPRIME, When and if necessary for the Station Case Officer in

charge of LIFEAT to meer any of the local agents under LIFEAT, it is under alias.

If protracted meetings of this type become necessary a cover story will be devel-

oped for the Case Ofticer's continued presence in Merico... such as "tourist"

status or commercial employment with an unnamed PBPRIME firm doing business

F. COVERAGE

During the month of January 1933 LIFEAT provided unilateral coverage on a total

uf 13 targe: lines. Coverage by target was as follows:

I. Aleksandr G. SIDOROV

2. and 3. Pulish Emlassy

%. 5. and 6. Yugoslav Embassy

?. and S.

aMs TRot Operailon

9. Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo

10. Sergio BELTRAN Lopez

11.. Home uf a Czech Intelligence Officer

12. Francisco WALTZ Olivera

13. Albert MALTZ

G. PERSONNEL

Divid M. WILSTED ieturned from home leave on 1 February 1963 and assumed full

responsibilities as LIFEAT vutside Case Officer, Wayne C. DRABAND and

LIEMERACE-S who subs ituted for WILSTED in the LIFEAT operational and technl-

cal phases respectively during WILSTED & absence are so be commended for their

maintaining LIFEAT at the high level of efficiency and security normally enjoyed

by the operation.

DRABAND's performance was the subject of separate correspon-

dence (see HNIMT -3-169):

As presently projected, Wayne C. DRABAND will be leaving Mexico or or about 1

Novemher 1963. The responsible Station Case Officer and WILSTED are attempting

to resolve the problem of a replacement for DRABAND a: the local level, primarily

from the pool of agents already employed under the project. This would have the

advantage of not further disseminating the fact that LIFEAT does exist, but would

have the serious drawback of giving knowledge of the whole operation (le. all

basehouses) to another Mexican national. (Nore: At present LIFEUD-2 and

LIFEUD-3. the wo

who now comeci the lap lines to the basehouses, are

the only Alexican nationals who know of the location of all LIFEN'T basehouses.)

The Siation does not desire another staff employee io fill this position, but would

prefer a U.S. citizen, technically competent, with sone working knowledge of Span-

Ish or ability to acquire a working knowledge of Spanish.

Since working papers are

extremely difficult to obtain at present, for cover purposes anyone coming into

Mexico to fill the LIFEAT position would probably have lo come as a recired person

with a guaranteed income. It is thought that perhaps an individual retiring from une

of the Armed Forces in a technical rating might have the best possibilities of filling

all the regairements noted.

Although the Station will continue to explore all possible solutions to the problem,

it is requested that Headquarters' views and, if possible. assistance be given the

Siation in this matter.

2. Di ring the reporting period a number of memoranda were prepared by

the Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in pari on

LIFEAT provided material. The following HMMS were provided as a by-produci

of the LIFE.AT Operation:
