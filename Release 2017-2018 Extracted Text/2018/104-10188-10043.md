09 the activities of AMSTRUT-2 and her relatives during critical periods of the

1) The installation of new municipal lighting for many areas in Mexico
City noted in referéice coxtinued during January 1963, bui at a reduced scale,
Some areas sch by LUFEAT baselouses are now free of the installation
crews,

li) Due to the circumstaaces under which most of the LIFEAT basehouse
keepers were originaily recruited or shifted from other projects to emp!oment
in LIFEAT (in most:cases at least ten years ago) they are either aware or have
reason to suspect that they are now, or at one time were, employed oy KUBARK
working out of the local ODACID ‘installation, LIFEAT outside principal agent,
Devid M, WILSTED, (at Station direction) is making a major ard continuing effort
“to orient the LIFEAT personnel toward the idea that there is 10 present contact
with the ODACID insiallation, that WELSTED and Ws m2 C, DRASAND (under alias)
are solely responsible for :he operation and that they report direcily to “Head-
quartecs" in PBPRIME, Waen and if necessary for the Station Case Officer in
charge of LIFEAT to meet any of the local agents under LIFEAT, it is uader alias,
If protracted meecings of this type Decome necessary a cover story will be devel-
oped for the Case Officer's continued presence in Mexico, ,.such as “tourist”
status or commercial employment with an uanamed PBPRIME firm doing bu:

&, COVERAGE

During che oath of January 1993 LIFEAT provided unilateral coverage on a total
of 13 targes lines. Coverage by target was as follows:

1, Aleksandr G, SIDOROV

2. and 3, Polish Embassy

4. 5. and 6, Yugoslav Embassy

7, and 8. AMSCRUT Operailon 7
9, Juan Jose AREVAi.O Bermejo
10. Sergio BELTRAN Lepez
1. . Home of a Czech Intelligence Officer

12, Francisco WALTZ Olivera
13. Albert MALTZ

_ G, PERSONNEL

David M, WILSTED Yeturned from home leave on 1 February 1963 and assumed full
responsibilities as LIFEAT outside Case Officer, Wayne C, DRABAND and
LIEMERACE-S who Subszituted for WILSTED in the LIFEAT operational and technl-
cal phases respectively during WILSTED's absence are to be commended for theit
maintaining LIFEAT at the high level of efficlency and security normally enjoyed
by the operation, DRABAND's performance was the subject of separate correspon-
deace (sce HMMT-3469),

As presently projected, Wayne C, DRABAND will be leaving Mexico on or about 1
November 1963, The responsible Station Case Officer and WILSTED are attempting
to resolve che problem of a replacement for DRABAND a: the local level, primarily
from the pool of agents already employed under the project, This would have the
advantage of not further disseminating the fact that LIFEAT does exist, but would
have the serious drawback of giving knowledge of the whole operation (t,e, all
basehouses) to another Mexican national, (Note: At present LIFEUD-2 and
LIFEUD-3. the two[____]who now co.neci the tap lines to :he basehouses, are
the only Mexican nat fonals who know of the location of all LUIFEAT basehouses, )

The Station does not desire another staff employee co fill this position, but would
prefer a 'J,S, citizen, technically competent, with sone working knowledge of Span-
ish or al to acquire a working knowledge of Spanish, Since working papers are
extremely difficult to obtain at present, for-cover purposes anyone coming into
Mexico to fill the LIFEAT position would probably have to come as a retired person
with a guaranteed inceme, It is though: that perhaps an individual reciring from une
of the Armed Forces in a technical rating might have the best: possibilities of filling
all the requirements noted,

Although the Siation will continue to explore all possible solutions to the problem,
it is requested that Headquarters’ views and, if possible. assis:ance be givea the
Scation in chis matter,

2, Ouring the reporting period a number of memoranda were prepared by
the Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in part on
LUFEAT provided material, The-following HMMs were provided as a by-product
of the LIFEAT Operation:

HMM-6993 HMM-7095
HMM-7OLL 2h HMM-70 48°
