2. On 7 May 1973 we were advised. by Station WH/Miami that pueaniee,
‘two employess of a Station WH/Miani proprietary had:told the
tation that one Rene VIERA Gonzalez, a Cuban exile? ournalist
“Who writes for Diario Las Americas and owns the Westchester
_ Mali’ Bookstore In Miami received a call in early May from one
ENU GOTTLIEB who said. he worked for tha Tines in Washington.
(GOTTLIEB is believed to be Sanford GOTTLIES, 11102 “Brandywine
 St., Kensington, Md. who was formerly an'employee ofi the - __.
‘National Committee on Sane Nuclear Policy". “A pretext call to
the Washington bureau of the New York fines verified: that one
"Sandy" Gottlieb was employed thére.) GOTTLIEB asked VIERA
'- what people in Miami were Saying about the Watergate’ case and
‘what participation the Cubans had in it. He specifically
" asked about the activities of Reinaldo PICO (former 2505
Brigade member), Orlando PIEDRA (former Chief of Cuban Bureau
‘o£ Investigation in Batista Sovernment), and Rolando MASFRRRER
(former Cuban Senator and self-admitted former Communist). .

According to GOTTLIEB, BUTTARI was appointed as "political
chief in the Republican Party", : eee :



3. GOTTLIEB apparently has current. information on the

(PAULA and Antonio Felix GENOVA Corzo, a WH/Miami proprietary ~
employee recently purchasad a jewelry business) and‘he knew -
that Reinaldo PICO had resided in Venezuela and had recently
returned to the United States. The phona conversation lasted
about 45 minutes and GOTTLIEB told VIERA that if he.came to

' Miami they would have lunch together. : ¢ Hanne
