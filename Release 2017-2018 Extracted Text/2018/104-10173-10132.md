MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

• I. I phoned Paul Burns, Special Assistant to the DDO, and

said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has

the action In the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the

fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance

activities of Barry Goldwater.

2. I said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burng

was not familiar with that title, but recognized it as the predecessor

of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington

field office. I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division

Chief of DO Division and now DCOSI

7 might be in a position to

give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then.

suggested that he be queried by cable.

Burns said Gaines is staying

on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available.

3. I said that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the

Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt

went:to the field in 1965.. He could give the background on the assign-

ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines at Helms!

direction. His recollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman

became COSL

Tlater, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide

information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.

I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines should be queried.

I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in

^—=-

domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that

his assignment to Spain after the clection could be presented as giving

him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue the matter to be

sure we know the facts.

I asked Burns to be sure that ve are on information distribution

of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for

keeping files.on Watergate.

He said we are on the PLMHPLANt for

messages to Helms.. He would advise the action officer. I said we are

available for any help we can give.

At the recent request of the Deputy Director for

Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched

its records to determine if we could find any payment to

Mr. Hunt in an amount of approximatcly $30,000 that required

no accounting.

a. The expense runs for the period July 1964 to

June 1973 for

the

the immediate Office of the DD/P: FI Staff

We have checked various items that vere re-

b.:

The

station, JNWAVE and FR/Washington

Office accountings

to determine it there were

funds passed by the Stations to Mr.. Hunt during

the year he

served under non-official cover in

Madrid.

We could find no payment to Mr.

Hunt

either

in his true name or his two identified

pseudonyms.

1960-1972 and have found nothing in these

travel claims that were

determined that $33,500 was advanced to him

for travel

and transportation of household

goods

to and from Madrid with one trip to

Paris for he and.his family to renew their

All of this advance was fully

accounted for. However, in his accounting,

one "item appeared unusual.

It was an

expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive

operation which was approved for

write-off by Nr.

Desmond Fitzgerald on i June 1966 without

further

we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

1. I spoke with. Fig Coleman about Hunt's assignment to Spain®

I.had spoken with him. back in August when we were inquiring into

reported activities involving Mrs. Hunt.

Z,: Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964

(by which he fised the time), and took over the Iberian desk. Bill

Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn

Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamessines)

that Hunt was to be assigned tol

Jas DCOS, as a directed assign-

"ment by Helms. A memo was prepared and sent to the COS, L

(now retired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan

called Coleman in and showed him & RYBAT letter from stating

that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the

Embassy.

Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt

was COS Montevideo, He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting

the days until Hunt left. The President of Uruguay visited President

Eisenhower in the States, at which time he requested a personal favor

that Hunt be reassigned to Montevideo. • So Hunt took another tour.

Woodward was outraged, and had his reverge in 196$ when Hunt was

to be sent as DCOS

4. After a couple of months--carly 1965--Ryan called Coleman

in and, observing that there was more than one way to skin a cat,

told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover. This

didn't require anything special, Ryan saying that he didn't know

much about it. It came to him from Karamessines on Helms' order.

Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do

nothing for the station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers

for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman

" said he never saw Hunt before he went out. He knows that there was

no operational reporting, to indicale that Hunt was doing anything:

## Page 9

COMTBENTTAL

The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was poor.

Coleman raloed the question with Ryan about his signing off, and

Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines. if ho wished. Because

Coleman had a close personal association with Karamessines he:

did just that. He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much

"about it eithor--"Helms said send him out." He was instructed to go

ahcad..

"In carly July 1966 (1 July) Coleman went to Madrid. He

had a ten day turnover with

Hunt had already gone and

he did not see him. said he didn't know what Hunt did, but

that Coleman need not vorry because he was gone.

6. Several months ago |

was at a seminar at which

Ambassador Woodward was also present.

At the time he asked

about funt.

Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.

Tad Saule had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to

Spain. Coleman observed that Szulc did have a long article on Hunt

in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment ivas mentioned,..

but without any conclusions as to its significance..

7. Coleman said the RYBAT file of C/EUR may have something on

the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern

I: I met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning

in GG10, where he is cleaning up some details before he goas to

his new assignment as DC/DCD. I told him generally about our

attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial

transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections ho may

have öf Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.

2.

Halpern said that he has no recollection about such an

assigament.

In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des

FitzGeräld when he became the DD/P. At about that time

Halpern's father died and he was in New York for the funeral

and ten days of religious observations following that." He was back

in mid-June. and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend

the National War College which began in August. He did not return

to that office until the end of June 1966.

Halpern observed that during this period Karamessines

was ADDP with Helms moving up to ba DDCI. He thought it entiroly

possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this

on their own.

Halpern said that Evan Parker had come into the office

of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned

from Honolulu for that purpose. He stajed on for Fit Gerald until

Halpern returned from the National War College. He suggested

someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something

abnut il (although ha may not). He also suggested talking to Georgia.

Mr. O'Malley reiterated his previous statements

that Mr. Hunt was referred

to his office for placement

assistance through the Office of the Executive Director,

then Colonel L. K. White. Mr. O Malley stated that in

as to whether of not executive level: interest was still

being shown in Mr. Hunt's post-enployment placement,

Mr. O'Malley recalled

ter reference on Mr. Hunt's resume and that Mr.. Holms

the company.

Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various

Agency officers to Mi. Hunt for guidance when these indi-

viduals expressed an interest in entering the public

relations field.

Mr. O'Malley did recall disappointment

in feeling Mr. Hunt had generally been less helpful on

Mir. Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several occasions

requesting referral of retiring Agency eployees vith

Nt. O'Malley also recalled a

request from Mr. liunt for an individual having skilis in

area of locks and surreptitious entry.

A rosume of

Mr. Thomas C. Anato was provided to Mr.. Hunt at that time.

It is Mr. O'Malley's recollection that Mr. Hunt specifically

that a person with Mr. Amato's qualifications was

niceded in connection with a requirement of the Howard

Hughes Organization in Las Vegas,

Nevada. Mr. O'Malley

stated the opinion that it was his impression that the

duties involved vould include the monitoring of a listening

device in an undisclosed location.

Mr. O'Malley reiterated

his understanding that Mr. Anato did not accept Mr. Hunt's

call wher

his. O'Nalley asked how his susgestion had worked out,

Mr. Hunt icsponded,

"Yes, they had done a fine job."

At this point Nr. O'Nalley was asked whether or not from

his associations with Mr.. Hunt he felt. Nr. Hunt was in

the habit of naking glib connents which sere not neces-

sarily accurate

in order to pass over a subject.

Mr.

O'Malley stated that this was catogorically so.

He said

he ras sure that Nr. Hunt had lied to hig on a number of

occasions and that, therefore, he was in no position to

• be sure that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact,

used the

services of Anderson Security Consultanis.

Mr. O'Mallcy

volunteered the opinion that he suspected

the clectronic

counterneasures "sweep"' was to be carried out in the offices

of tho Committée

to Re-elect the President.

In response to a question as to whether he had

ever

referred anyone

to NcCord Associates, Mr.

O'balley

replied that he remembered having referred walter Brayden.

Brayden for a time acted as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha

Nitchell.

As an aside Mr. O'Malley nentioned that Mr.

Brayden had refused to carty a firearn in spice of the

fact that Mr. McCord told hin he could do so on the auchor

ity. of the Attorney General.

Asked specifically if he had

ever referred either Willian Slea or Teresa Shea to Mr.:

NeCord, Mr. O'Nalley stated that he did not recall specif-

had not rearing Teresa Sea and that he was sure that he

Icferred Willian Shea to hin.

So, contrary to

1.

On the morning of 14 Februsry 1971 Messrs.

Frederick Evans and Lawrence Hove intervieved Mr. Raymond

A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operationg.

The purpose.of

the interview was to follow up on infor

mation contained in Office of Sacurisy files which stated

the beller that Individuals in the

Counter.

Operations office had knowledge of the writing activities

of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. This belief vas a matter of record

in the files of the former Secuzisy Research Staff and was

attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynot, now ratired, and MI. Edward

Sayle.

2.

During this interview Mr. Roces was specifically

askad whether or not he had knorledge of the existence of

any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.

E. Honard Hunt to writo novels to inprove the image of

chis Agency.

Additionally, Nr. Rocca was asked whether

ох пос злу

assistance was ever raquasted of the Counter

Intelligenco Operstions offica to be provided to Mr. Hunt

or whether or not that staff had ever had any relationship

with Mr. Hunt whatsoever.

In response to these questions

M=. Rocca

sesponded "on

the record" that he has no knowledge

о*

any such arrangaments nor ai any time has he party to any.

assistance or any raquests. for assistance to Mr. Hunt®

Mr.-

Rocca stated that the particular seccion which he had been

nost acively concerned in the past yoars was responsible

for bandlins a variaty of tasks categorized under the area

of "setting the rocord straigha."

in this sense, the "inage"

mission of

the offico was to coutor misinforation: cur-

rently in cha media or othervise believed to be part of an

e§for:

to discredit the Agency.

Ne. Rocca fauls that any

assumption that Mr. Hunt was

engaged in any form of Agency

sponsored Image activity would have probably load to cho

conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intelligence

Operations.

Howoyer, Mr. Rocca enpatically stated that

this was not the case.

3.

Mr. Rocca was thoroughly candid and cooperative

duriag the course of this interview.

He was unable to

suggest alternato means of attenptiag to deternine if

any official Agency sponsorship of Mr. Hunt did in face

exist.

Mr. Rocca

did venture the opinion

that he felt

that in all probability an official acquiescence on the

part of senior officials might have been involved rather

than an official sponsorship.

It was agroud. by all lu

this discussion that the nature of any informal support

given to Mr. Hunt would be far nore difficult to define

in the absence of any formalized agreements.

MEMORANDUNI FOR: Mr. Kuhn

SUBJECT: General Gaynor's Recollections

This date, at your instruction, I called Gen. Paul F. Gaynor

to seek his recollections regarding his knowledge of the writings of

" Mr. 'Hunt and any official who might be aware of the circumstances

of any Agency involvement in that eifort.

2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear

on the matter, and that he was "reaching, " but stated that has he

reconstructs the matter:

a.. He became aware that Hunt, while in WII, was accomplishing

a steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re

quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. (He stated'

that this acticity continued later,

as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and

agreed with idca that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate

that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.) Gon. Gaynor advised

that he raised the issue "up front" on severa! occasions. The reaction

he recieved to his raising the issue was that "keep your stinking nose out

0! this business. " He stated that he was lead to believe that Mr. Helms

desized to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agency

and that Hunt's books were a part of the program to du 10. He stated that

hew, never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he

recieved lead him to believe this was the case.

b.

He suggested that tivo people might be able to assist in clearing

the issue, Ray Rocca and Walter Piorzheimer, both of whom were involved

in the "'image" materials. He stated that Piorsheimer secmed to be avara

of all the details - on an up to date basis - of Huat's departurc from the

Agency to join the public relations firm, to the degree that Gen. Gaynor

gained the belie! that Hunt was merely moving his dosk outside the building,

but being paid by the same source as before.

Ile also advised that he kept

Niss Ethel Mendoza fairly current on what he was learning about Hini's

activities because she followed the case for him, and suggested that her

Iccall about what he had learned and wher and what resulted, might be:

botter than his aù this date.

SUBJECT:

Terence S. CRABANAC - Reterition of

Royalties by a Contract Employee

1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to

the retention of future royalties which might be carned by Terence S.

CRABANAC as a rcsult of his literary efforts. We believe that he is

entitled to rctain such royalties withou an offset against his Agency

salary.

We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that

CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC'S

cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service

Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contraci dated 4 July 1965 may

Royaltics from the fictional works that he writes as

a profitable hobby will not ba emoluments rcceived from or through his

'"'covcr activities."
