activities of Barry Goldwater. : : :

2, I.said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns aa
was not familiar with that title, but recognized it as-the predecessor fan
of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington
field office. I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division
Chief of DO Division.and now DCOS might be in a position to
give 4 few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I
suggested that he be queried by cable. Burns said Gaines is staying =~ 4
on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available. . ;

3. Teaid that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the j
Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and ‘when Hunt R
went:to the field in 1965, He could give the background on the assign- i f.

Lgave'as a possible préss treatinent that Hunt was engaged in ~

Hr. O'Malley recalled that Mr. Richard Helms, then

. Director of Central Intelligence, was listed as a charac-

ter reference on Mr. Hunt's resume and that ‘Mr.. Helms

contacted in the last month of Mr- Slunt's Agéncy service by

Nr. Hunt became instrumental in discussing several aspects
of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of
the company. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various
Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-
viduals expressed an interest in entering the public
relations field. Mr. O'Malley did recall disappointnent
in feeling Mr. Hunt had generally been less helpful on
these occasions. : 7 .

5. Mrs Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several ‘occasions
requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with’
specific qualifications. These instances occurred apparent-
ly after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with
the White House. In one instance Nr. Hunt requested re-
ferral of a recently retired Agency secretary. As in
previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Malley was uaable
to recall the name of this individual. He. did, -however, -
state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turned down the
individual whom he referred: .As a point of clarification,
Hr. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously
been known. to Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked

.for him in any capacity. Mr. O'Malley also recalled a.

request from Mr. liunt for an individual having skilis in
the area of locks’ and surreptitious entry. A resume of

Mr. Thomas C€. Amato wes provided to Nr. Hunt at that time.

‘Stated that a person with Mr. Amato's qualifications was
needed .in connection with a requirement of the HK

Hughes Organization in Las Vogas, Nevada.: Mr. O'Malley
stated the opinion that it was his impression’ that the

O'Malley recommended the Wackenhut Corporation... Mr.



ley recalled that Mr. Hunt expressed tisfaction
tht gestion in part because teat.
viowed as that firm's politicat cricatctia O'Malley

did not claborate further oa that remark. Mr. O'M lley
then suggested the use of Anderson Security Consultants,
Inco ated, | _ |
—,\ Nr. O'Nalley stated that insofar as this

ization was advertised in the yellow pages and that
Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the ser-
vices, he felt this tobe a reasonable suggestion. Mr.
O'Malley stated that during a subsequent phone call when
Nr. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worked out,”

-Ur, Hunt. responded, "Yes, they had done a finé job."

At. this point Nr. O'Malley was asked whether or not from
his associations With Mr. Hunt he felt Nr. Hunt was in

the habit of making glib comments which were not neces-
sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr.
O'Malley stated that. this was categorically so. He said

he was sure that Nr. Hunt had lied to hin.on a number of
occdsions and that,therefore, he was in no position to

be sure ‘that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact, used the
services of Anderson Security Consultants. ‘Mr. O'Malley
volunteered the Opinion that he suspected the electronic .
countermeasures "sweep" was. to be carried out in the offices

“of the Comnittes to Re-elect the President. -

7. -In response to a question as to uhether he had
ever referred anyone to McCord Associates, Mr. O'Malley
replied that he remembered having referred Walter Brayden.
i Brayden for a time acted as-bodyguard to Mrs. Martha
Mitchell. As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned that Mr.
Brayden had refused to carry a firearm in spite of the
fact that Mr. McCord told him he could do so on the author-
ity.of the Attorney General. Asked specifically if he had

.ever referred either William Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.,

McCord, Mr. O'Malley Stated that ‘he did not recall specif-
igally referring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he
had not'referred Willian Shea to hin. So, contrary to

in. Mae rid; Spain, on 16 August 1965. The'costs of this

travel weré: charged to the budget of the Western Haai-

marized PCS travel expenses and included a payment for
apartaent rental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with a
payment in the amount of $125 to Mr. for
this purpose.

on the David St. Joha Novsls

1. On the morning of 14 February 1974 Messrs.

* Frederick Bvans: and: Lawrence Howe interviewed Mr. Raymond

A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelkigence Operations.

The purpose of tha interview was to follow up on infor-
mation contained in Office of Security files which stated
the belief that individuals in the Counter Intelligence
Operations office had knowledge of tha writing activities -— -
of Mr, E, Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and was
attributed to Mr. Paul enen now retired, and Mr. Edward

Sayle. :

2. During this interview Mr. Roces was specifically
asked whether or not he had knowledze of the existence of
any forn of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.
E. Howard Hunt to-writo novels to improve the image of
this Agency. Additionally, Nr. Rocca was asked whether
or not any assistance was ever requasted of the Counter
intelligence. Operstions offics-to be provided to Mr. Hunt

“Or whither of hot that staff-had ever-had any relationship

with. Mr. Hunt whatsdever. In response to these questions F
Mr. Rocca responded on the record" that he has no knowledge

of any such arrangements nor at any. tine was a party to any
assistance or any Faquests.for. ass. cz to Mr. Hunt. Mr.
Rocca stated that the particular section wh ‘he had been. -----
most accively conctrned in th: past:.y: was responsible
for bineustied a variety of tasks categorized under the area
of "setting the record: straight." In this sense, the "image"
mission of the office was to counter nisinfornation . cur-
rently in the media.or othetwise believed to be part of an
effort to discredit the Agency, Mr. Rocca feels that any
assumption that Mr. Hunt was engagsd in any form of Agency
sponsored ‘image activity would hsVe-prdébably lead to the
conclusion that: it was done under the Counter Intelligence
Operations. . However, Mr. Rocca emphatically stated that
this waa not the case.

FC Fe, MjpEP SI:



3. Mr. Rocca was..thoroughly candid and cooperative
during the course of this intervicw. He was unable to
suggest alternate neans of attempting to deteraine if
any. official Agency sponsorship of Mr. Hunt did in fact
exist. Mr. Rocca did venture the opinion that he felt
that in all probability an official acquiescence on the.
part of senior officials might have been involved rather
than an official sponsorship. It was agroed by all in
this discussion that the nature of any informal support
gives to Mr. Hunt would be far nore difficult to define

in the absence of any, formalized agreements.

written by. Mr B.: Howard Hunt.. This interview was. undertaken
at your request in an effort to determine if Mr. Hunt had

acted in any capacity in cooperation with Counter Intelligence
Operations, It. has previously been alleged in Office of
Security records that Messrs. Paul Gaynor and Edward Sayle

of Security Research Staff, believed that Mr. Hunt. had written
novels at Agency request and that this effort had been known _

first St. John book, On Hazardous Duty, appeared in 1965, he
undertook to identify the trie name oF the author. Mr.
Pforsheimer related that he checked with a source in the copy-

accerted the suggestion and Mr. Pfortzheiner recalls that
subsequent copyright applica’ > wats submitted without: -
the address. Within five. minutes of the conversation with-
Mr. Karazessines, Mr. Pforzheimer recalls being called. by
Mr. Richard Holms, then Deputy Director of Central. Intelligence.
Mr. Pforzheimer recalls the substance of the conversation as
being, "for Christ sake Walter, this is the first book to.-:
come along and say.something good about the Agency.” "hy

not leave the Goddamn thing alone. .

3.° The undersigned asked Nr. Pforsheimer, who to his

Knowledge, would be in a position to confirm or deny whether
Mr. Hunt was under any form of Agency sponsorship in his
writing of the David St. John novels. Nr. Pfortzheimer replied
that he was never officially briefed on the matter and that
orily Mr. Helms or Mr. Karamessines could provide the answer.
Mx. Pforzheimer was then asked if either Mr. Angleton or Mr.
Rocca of Counter Intelligence Operations would have any
knowledge of this activity. Mr. Pforzheimer replied that he

doubted it seriously.

_ 4+ Myr, Pforzheimer went on to relate that he was
Occasionally tasked to do research for Mr. Hunt. He recalled
on one occasion being asked ‘to research the Indian religious

ites involving use of funeral pyres. Mr. Pforzheiner
remembered that this theme figures significantly in Nr. Hunt's
subsequent novel Tower of Silence which appeared under the
Sty John pen name in 1966. Nr. Pforzheimer parenthetically |
pointed out the origin of the pen name as being the names of
Mr. Hunt's two sons--bavid and St. John.

; 5. Tracing Mr. Hunt's career assignments, it is noted
thdt he was assigned to the Office of the Deputy Director

for, Operations then designated, the DDP/Operations Group, in
Fobruary 1965. The first David St. John book was published
during 1965. From June 1965 through September 1966, Mr. Hunt laity
was assigned to Madrid, Spain a3 a Contract Agent. During
1966, three St. John books appeared in print, the highest out-
put for any year. “Mr. Hunt published one book under the
St. John pseudonym in 1967, ani one each in the years 1963, -
1969,.1971 and 1972. Mr. Hunt officially retired as an Agency’
Staff Employee effective 30 April 1970.

6. A check of Office of Security records did not develop
any indication that any of the David St. John manuscripts were
ever submitted for review in accordance with Agsncy regulations.
There is no documentary evidence currently. available to the ‘
Office of Security to either confirm or deny possible Agency

‘The reaction

that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.
that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions,
