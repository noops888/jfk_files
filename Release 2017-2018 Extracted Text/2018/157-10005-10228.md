earlier, that when I first inquired around for the location of

Colonel Pash and his assistant, the reaction I encountered

very little.

And so when Colonel Pash seemed reluctant to become
involved in responding affirmatively to my questions, my
inference was that Colonel Pash and{__|could well not

Now that was my impression, and I was a little disgusted

by it. I think I talked to the Chief of the PP staff later,

who was of course well aware of the Albanian problem and I

said I didn't get any satisfaction from Pash, but it doesn't

really make any difference because we don't have the name

of the suspected individual.

Mr. Baron. Just to stop here for a second and clear up

some of these details, were you under the impression that what

you called wet affairs, assassinations, kidnappings, or other

removals from the scene of troublesome individuals was the

primary function of this unit that Pash and were

running?

Mr. Hunt. Yes. In fact the only. -As far as I knew,

never made aware of what it was.

Do you know anything about Colonel Pash's background?

Mr. Baron. I know a bit, but if you think that there are
relevant details to put on the background, go ahead.

Mr. Hunt. Well, I had not thought of Colonel Pash for

| years until I began reading a book called "Lawrence and Oppen-

heimer," and I saw quite a few references to Colonel Pash. I
had known previously that he had been associated during the
war with the Manhattan Project and that he had a security
background, And as I believe I touched on briefly before, it
was my impression that Pash had been active a couple of years
at least before I knew him in West Germany with the sort of
thing that we had been discussing so far today.

Mr. Baron. What kinds of stories had you heard about
Pash's previous activities?

Mr. Hunt. Kidnappings mostly.

Mr. Baron. And where were those?

Mr. Hunt. West Germany and West Berlin.

Mr. Baron. Do you know the names of any of the victims
of the kidnapping or any of the people involved other than

Pash and

Mr. Hunt. I do not.

Mr. Baron. And are you aware from whatever source of

any assassination planning or attempts that Pash was involved

Mr. Hunt. I am not.

Mr. Baron. Does your answer include not only the period
of time before you talked with Colonel Pash but after you
talked with Colonel Pash?

Mr. Hunt. Yes, sir.

I might add that I was rather briefly at CIA headquarters
at that time and within a very short period of time after I
had had my interview with Colonel Pash, I was transferred to the
Guatemala project, the overthrow of Guatemala.

Mr. Baron. Is that the reason why you did not follow up f

on the problem with this particular suspected double agent

Well, not being held, but where they

were being housed and trained for Albanian operations.

Mr. Baron. Can you explain the term "retainer"?

Mr. Hunt. Well, I understood that when he finally got
out of Albania, that he brought with him what I can best
describe as retainers. That is bodyguards, members of his
personal staff, probably some relatives. I think he had
four or five sisters with him. But the able-bodied portion

Mr. Baron. But that would be the person primarily

Mr. Hunt. That's correct.

Mr. Baron. Are you aware of what happened with that

Mr. Hunt. I have no idea because, as I may have indicated

| previously off the record, it became apparent some years later

that the unfortunate fate of our Albanian agents was linked
far more closely to the revelations of Kim Philby, the
Soviet agent who was in direct liaison with us in Washington
and in Great Britain, rather than any penetration, although
the possibility of a penetration was of course always there.
But I don't think that anybody was ever focused.

the division chief about it, although it was not, it had not

that time was John Richardson of later Vietnam fame.
It's also possible that the Division Chief in that era

was John Baker, now deceased, who left that division to

become Chief of the PP staff, and that would have been a
normal follow through for me if I had discussed it with John
Baker, my direct Chief, and then to have discussed it with i
him when he was my staff chief in the overall political and |
psychological staff. |

There's a man named who was in the

Psychological Warfare Branch of the PP staff. I believe at

which later became the International Organizations Division,
then headed by Cord Myer, Jr., and his Deputy at that time was
Tom Braden, the now-columnist whose wife has just ascended to
the Executive Office Building. There were members of the
Labor Branch, and I'm trying to think of that branch of office

that was down the hall.

There was a labor branch. The people in there might know. -

There was a lady lawyer named Carol somebody who was very
knowledgeable about what was going on in that area.

Mr. Hunt. Well, in the sense that when you have an
adjoining office, you usually pretty much know what the other
fellow is doing. Just in that sense, because her function
in the labor’ branch had nothing to do with Pash, to my
knowledge.

It was about that time that General Cushman was still
assigned to the CIA. I could be wrong about that but I seem
to have a memory of Cushman being around in those days. He
was then a Colonel. I had associated with him. In fact, we
had shared an office at one time, but that was several years
earlier. I would place it about early 1949, But I'm quite
sure that Cushman was around in that period of time and
involved with the PP staff, though what his function was I

don't know.

then members of the PP stafé, { Rang

These are men who in effect established the PP staff for
Frank Wisner and then left to go on to other things. They

Mr. Baron, Let me just return to one name that you

Did you -- first, generally, what was the nature of your

Did you have any?

Mr. Hunt. I never had any, no. In fact, I've only seen
him once in my life, to the best of my recollection.

Mr. Baron. As you may know, William Harvey was tasked
in 1961 with setting up an executive action gapability at
the CIA, tasked originally by Richard Bissell to carry out

assassinations if required.

than I did previously when we were taking sort of a wide

| Swipe at the canvas.

Colonel Pash indicated or said to me that it was a matter
that would have to be approved by higher authority and as
a relatively low ranking officer in those days, I thought he
was probably referring to Frank Wisner. And indeed, he may
have. It never got pushed up to Frank Wisner's level because
there no direct approach or a request for such approval
was ever made.

I left with the impression that Colonel Pash was glad
that he wasn't going to have any business for me or that he
had successfully deflected whatever approach I might be making
to him because it would give him and{ span
opportunity to drink more coffee and to draw their salaries
from the Agency while affecting to do a job that they were
perhaps not equipped to do.

Now again, that impression I had when I left him was at

variance with what I had heard before I came in, where I heard

he and or he at least had been active in West Germany

in wet affairs, particularly kidnappings and that sort of
thing.
Mr. Baron, And you carried into his office the impression

that Colonel Pash was a man who could carry off an assassination

Mr. Baron. Did you ever discuss this matter with anyone
ether than Colonel Pash?

Mr, Hunt. In that context?

Mr. Baron. In the context of assassinations or kidnapping.

Mr. Hunt. Well, I wasn't involved in plotting or planning
any kidnappings. Again, I would suggest that I might very

well have gone back tol uno was the most interested

individual, because he was responsible at the branch level

{ sis an operational tool, whereas, I had an overall

the background of that, the rubric under which I became

my assumption at that time was that authorization by Frank
Wisner would have been all that would have been required to

proceed with the project had it ever materialized. That is

| + .
j the Chief of the Clandestine Services.

1 Now whether Frank would have been required to go to

Allen Dulles, I rather doubt it. I think it is something that

| he would have been able to authorize himself.

Mr. Baron. All right. Let me ask you now before we get
into Colonel Pash's version of the story, which we will,
| whether it is possible that you are confusing the time periods
here?

So as not to hold anything back from you, Colonel Pash
has said that the time period has to be off because he
retired from the Agency, or left the Agency in probably late
‘Sl. It's possible that it went into 1952, But he wasn't
with the Agency in any capacity after '52. And in fact, his
status was. that of a military officer who had been detailed
to the Agency from approximately 1948 to '52.

Now does that affect your recollection in any way of the
period '54 to '55 as the period when your conversation with
Boris Pash took place?

Mr, Hunt. Well, from 1950 to 1953, I was in Mexico

Mr. Baron. And where were you from the time that you

joined the Agency until you went to Mexico?

Mr. Hunt. I was a member of the PP staff.

Mr. Baron. Is it possible that your conversation with
Boris Pash about the assassination of a suspected double agent
took place in that time period?

Mr. Hunt. I would have to say it's possible, yes.

Mr. Baron. Would you have been dealing with East

| European problems or --~

Mr. Hunt. No, I was dealing with West European problems.

Mr. Baron. I'm sorry. Would you have been dealing with
a problem like this one, a problem with a suspected Albanian
double agent in West Germany during that time period?

Mr. Hunt, I can't recall having done so. The West
European Division had its own PP staff officer and he would
have been the one to take it up, whereas my recollection is
that this was generated at a later time when I was in the
Southeast European Division and had a direct reason to become
interested in the matter.

I have to say that it is possible, but I would say maybe
5 percent possible.

Mr. Baron. And you accord so small a possibility to
the hypothesis that you actually talked to Pash about this
problem in '49 or '50 because you were not involved in
operations in West Germany at that point.

Mr. Hunt. No, I was not.

Mr. Hunt. Physically I was in the JRK building with the

who I have mentioned earlier.

Mr. Baron. Did you travel to West Germany during that
period of time?

period after I left Mexico, which was in, I think, March of '54

for about the ensuing year when I left for the Guatemala project’

I was in Washington or the SE Europe Division. So I had
that continuous almost year there.

Mr. Baron. Is there anything else that adds to your

Do you recall any dealings that you had in your earliest

That is, I had seen him in the corridors, but it was the

My memory is further jogged in this respect, that

the possibility of his being aasigned to the SE division.

Mr. Hunt. After Allen Dulles's resignation and retirement,

I was assigned for about a period of a week to the CA staff

| Division under Tracy Barnes, which was really the Commercial

Operations Division, although it was never so-called. 1

I was the first Chief of Covert Action for the Domestic !

Operations Division and we inherited as a new division a number '

of projects that had been running for a period of time, that !

had been run by the commercial staff of the Agency and by a

number of the geographic divisions.

The purpose of turning these ongoing projects over to the

Domestic Operations Division was to centralize contacts with

divisions such as the Asian or Far East Division which might

want a book published on ror a particular purpose. :

They would come to Tracy Barnes with a particular request.

And I should say that the relationship with the

that I was the only one, I guess, who knew anything about the

publishing industry, who had ever been connected with the

And at that time, with the help of our own commercial
people within the Division, our accountants and auditors and

so forth determined that there were a number of aspects of

our fiduciary relationship with the eee company that would
bear greater investigation.

So the relationship from a freewheeling one prior to our

it became sort of an unpleasant continuous argument about

dollars and cents, rather than functional matters.

audience for the publication?

Mr. Hunt. Well, I knew that it was not a part of the
Agency charter, and it was a matter that the USIA looked at.

I talked about it occasionally. The USIA coincidentally had

come under some criticism at that time for subsidizing certain
publishers in the United States. That became known; I don't

Barnes the danger that we might be criticized for the same |

Mr, Baron. Were any techniques used to prevent contamina- !

undertakings to Cuban leadership and to our own paramilitary
people, and had failed to carry them out.

However, this fact was successfully disguised for a number |

In any events, the Bay of Pigs cost Dulles his leadership

of the Agency, and I had the utmost respect for him. I was 1

associated with him as an assistant for the special Cuban
Bay of Pigs purposes, for a period of several months prior to,
perhaps six months prior to his eventual retirement.

I had had occasional contacts with him as pycnio? off]

and we had some discussions. Mr. Dulles brought into the
formal Central Intelligence Agency the same feeling of esprit
de corps that we had all enjoyed in the Office of Strategic
Services, and this was largely lost during the McCone director-
ship. And I think we had some admiral after that, Admiral
Radford, possibly. we got under a group of managers, and the
human element that we had enjoyed in OSS was gone with the :
passage of Allen Dulles until Dick Helms came back in. You
see, I'm an unrepentent admirer of Allen Dulles and the way we

A year ago when Congress established the Church Committee, Senator

STATEMENT BY B. HOWARD HUNT

Baker was quoted as saying that I would be an early witness. I was then free
on Appeal and readily available to testify concerning CIA involvement in
allegedly dllegal Saat = Moreover, I viewed testifying before the
Committee as & further/to testify under oath concerning my total non =
involvement with Messrs Oswald, Bremer and Sirhan, persons with whom my
name has been slanderously and libelously linked in press and electronic
media, Although I had been interviewed previously by the FBI and the Rock-
efeller Commission with regard to these allegations a host of assassination
buffs and media advocates continued irresponsibly to associate me with the
deathe of the Kennedy brothers and the crippling of Governor Wallaces

My Appeal denied, I re-entered prison in April,1975. Three weeks
later US Marshals escorted me to Washington DC for what turned out to be a
three-hour interview with a new Watergate Assistant Special Prosecutor. For
a Jeday period I was ledged at the Leesburg, Vas, jail,and finally returned
via Detroit and Tallahassee where I was imprisoned in the isolation area
before being driven on May 26 to Eglin Federal Prison Camp. On May 27,
Assistant Comittee Counsel Michael Madigan telephoned me to say that the
Church Committee wanted to interview me “within the next two weeks". I
apprised Mr. Madigan of Public Law 93-209, Title 18. Sec.4082(c) Para. 1
(amended) which authorises minimum security prisoners such as myself to be
furloughed for up to 30 days for purposes of testifying. Counsel Madigan
agreed to ny testifying on this furlough basise

Over the sumer,however, I heard nothing further from Hr. Madigen
or his Committee associates. Than in mid-September 2 Washington POST story
alleged that I had been assigned by a White House superior to assassinate
columist Jack Anderson. Senator Church was thereupon quoted as saying

that his Committee would investigate the charges. I welcomed this apparent

opportunity, for the allegations had gained wide credence while my om
delayed response appeared only incompletely in the press, Still, nothing
was heard from the Committees

‘In December 1975 John Crewdson of the New York Times interviewed
me in prison. He asked if I new anything about "CIA assassination capae
bilities", and I related to him my encounter with Col. Boris T. Pash. Mre
Crewdson then inquired whether the Church Committee had interviewed me.
I responded in terms of the foregoing, noting that I would have testified
about the Pash encounter had I been given the publicized opportunities.
My interview with Mr. Crewdson was published and shortly thereafter my
attorney was contacted by a representative of the Committee.

I consider it highly discriminatory that the Committee is
unwilling te have me testify in Washington as a furloughed witness.
Further, the Committee's refusal to postpone interviewing me in prison
util one of two counsel familiar with my career and affairs is available
places me in a difficult position with regard to representation by informed
legal counsel. And, as during the Ervin Committee hearings ( whose cost in
legal fees to me approached $100,000) I must again pay legal fees occasioned
by the interest of the Senate in a matter of no discernible benefit to me.

Between last January and April I could freely have traveled to
Washington to testify at the pleasure of the Senate. From then on I could
have been furloughed for that purpose and testified accompanied by customary
counsel who are not now available to me. Nevertheless, in demonstration of

my willingness to cooperate fully with the Senate I agree to be interviewed

under oath today. ZH Pa (a
