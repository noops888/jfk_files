1. On January 10, 1976, I was examined by Frederick D.

Baron, a counsel for the Sénate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities.

On January 11, 1976, I was examined by both Mr. Baron and Howard

both of these examinations I was accompanied by my counsel, Randall C.

Coleman, and advised of my Constitutional rights.

2. I have read the transcripts of both of the above-

mentioned examinations, and I hereby affirm that my testimony

therein is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

might have directed me to this particular unit.

I was told that somewhere within the overall political

and psychological staff there was located a man with a small

office.

This man's name was Pash, Colonel Boris Pash, and

my understanding was that colonel Pash had been doing business,

let us say, with the Agency in west Germany for quite a while.

I sought out Colonel Pash. I was directed to his office

and found sitting with him another Agency officer named?

I'm not sure whether it is

point on, let's say, a search mission to determine whether the

alleged capability of Colonel Pash in wet affairs, which is

how it was referred to, that is liquidations, would have any

relevance to our particular problem of the Albanian dis-

appointments.

MI. Baron. By liquidations, you mean assassinations?

Mr. Hunt. Ansassinations. Assassinations, kidaappings,

removals, let's say.

This had been alleged to me. So I spoke to Colonel Pash

in Mr.

presence. I explained the problem to him,

although at that juncture I'm quite sure that we had not

identified the Albanian suspect. So we were talking hypothetically

earlier, that when I first inquired around for the location of

Colonel Pash and his assistant, the reaction I encountered

was a rather jesting one, and the impression I gained was

here were a couple of men who were drawing salaries and doing

very little.

And so when Colonel Pash

seemed reluctant to become

involved in responding affirmatively to my questions, my

inference was that Colonel Pash and

could well not

have such a capability but for purposes of employment and

status, this was the job they had. But they didn't want

anyone to call upon them to activate their particular

abilities.

Now that was my impression, and I was a little disgusted

by it. I think I talked to the Chief of the PP staff later,

who was of course well aware of the Albanian problem and I

said I didn't get any satisfaction from Pash, but it doesn't

really make any difference because we don't have the name

of the suspected individual.

Mr. Baron. Just to stop here for a second and clear up

some of these details, were you under the impression that what

you called wet affairs, assassinations, kidnappings, or other

removals from the scene of troublesome individuals was the

primary function of this unit that Pash and

were

running?

Mr. Hunt. Yes. In fact the only. As far as I knew, they

never made aware of what it was.

Do you know anything about Colonel Pash's background?

MI. Baron. I know a bit, but if you think that there are

relevant details to put on the background, go ahead.

Mr. Hunt. Well, I had not thought of Colonel Pash for

years until I began reading a book called "Lawrence and Oppen-

heimer," and I saw quite a few references to Colonel Pash. I

had known previously that he had been associated during the

I war with the Manhattan Project and that he had a security

background. And as I believe I touched on briefly before, it

was my impression that Pash had been active a couple of years

at least before I knew him in West Germany with the sort of

thing that we had been discussing so far today.

Mr. Baron. What kinds of stories had you heard about

Pash's previous activities?

Mr. Hunt. Kidnappings mostly.

Mr. Baron. And where were those?

Mr. Hunt. West Germany and West Berlin.

Mr. Baron. Do you know the names of any of the victims

of the kidnapping or any of the people involved other than

Pash and

Mr. Hunt. I do not.

Mr. Hunt. I am not.

MI. Baron. Does your answer include not only the period

of time before you talked with Colonel Pash but after you

talked with Colonel Pash?

Mr. Hunt. Yes, sir.

I might add that

I was rather briefly at CIA headquarters

at that time and within a very short period of time after I

had had my interview with Colonel Pash, I was transferred to the

Guatemala project, the overthrow of Guatemala.

MI. Baron. Is that the reason why you did not follow up

on the problem with this particular suspected double agent

after not receiving satisfaction from Colonel Pash?

Mr. Hunt. That certainly could have been one reason.

Why were they being parachuted to their

scene in West Germany, where the balance of his retainers were

well, not being held, but where they

were being housed and trained for Albanian operations.

Mr. Baron. Can you explain the term "retainer"?

Mr. Hunt. Well, I understood that when he finally got

out of Albania, that he brought with him what I can best

describe as retainers. That is bodyguards, members of his

personal staff, probably some relatives. I think he had

four or five sisters with him. But the able-bodied portion

of those loyalists who came out with him we had largely taken

Mr. Baron. But that would be the person primarily

responsible for taking care of this double agent problem?

MI. Hunt. That's correct.

Mr. Baron. Are you aware of what happened with that

suspected double agent?

MI. Hunt. I have no idea because, as I may have

indicated

previously off the record, it became apparent some years later

that the unfortunate fate of our Albanian agents was linked

far more closely to the revelations of Kim Philby, the

Soviet agent who was in direct liaison with us in washington

and in Great Britain, rather than any penetration, although

the possibility of a penetration was of course always there.

But I don't think that anybody was ever focused.

Again, I left for Latin American affairs. I left the

Division about that time and I really never heard about it

again.

Southeast Asia, and the whole sort of complex of knowledgeable

Colonel Pash with the idea in mind of seeing if an assassination

Mr. Hunt. The then Chief of Foreign Intelligence and

Counter-Intelligence for the Division. And I think now that that

was

charley angion, Charice beatley. I think he wore both

hats. He had both foreign intelligence responsibility and

the counter-intelligence responsibility. And I might have told

the division chief about it, although it was not, it had not

achieved

such stature at that point that I would have

necessarily talked to the Division Chief, who I believe at

that time was John Richardson

_of later Vietnam fame.

It's also possible that the Division Chief in that era

was John Baker, now deceased, who left that division to

become Chief of the PP staff, and that would have been a

normal follow through for me if I had discussed it with John

Baker, my direct Chief, and then to have discussed it with

him when he was my staff chief in the overall political and

psychological staff.

Mr. Baron. Anyone else who would have known about your

approach to Colonel Pash or about --

Mr. Hunt. Or his function.

Mr. Baron. Yes, that Colonel Pash was considered to have

assassinations as one of his functions.

Mr. Hunt. We had a Colonel Buffington who at that time

was a member of the 'PP staff, the overall PP staff, and I think

that was down the hall.

There was a labor branch. The people in there might know.

There was a lady lawyer named Carol somebody who was very

knowledgeable about what was going on in that area.

Mr. Baron. Knowledeable about Pash's activities?

Mr. Hunt. Well, in the sense that when you have an

adjoining office, you usually pretty much know what the other

fellow is doing. Just in that sense, because her function

in the labor branch had nothing to do with Pash, to my

knowledge.

What I'm trying to do here is to give you sort of a

knowledge through me. I'm not sure. I have made a list of

other people whom I have not mentioned who conceivably, by

virtue of personal contact or functional responsibility, might

well have been aware of Pash's true functional responsibility

within the Agency.

MI. Baron. Before I ask you to tick off that list, let's

make it clear that all of the names, in addition to

are names that you have given as people who are

likely to have been knowledgeable of Pash's activities because

of their place in the organization structure at that time.

Mr. Hunt. That's correct, or as I have indicated in some

cases, as with the PP labor branch by virtue of physical

proximity to that office.

Mr. Baron. Okay. Why don't you now just run very briefly

through the names of other people who you think could conceivably

have been knowledgeable of Pash's function?

It was about that time that General Cushman was still

assigned to the CIA. I could be wrong about that but I seem

to have a memory of Cushman being around in those days.

He

was then a Colonel. I had associated with him. In fact, we

had shared an office at one time, but that was several years

earlier. I would place it about early 1949. But I'm quite

sure that Cushman was around in that period of time and

involved with the PP staff, though what his function was I

These are men who in effect established the PP staff for

Frank Wisner and then left to go on to other things. They

Mr. Baron. Let me just return to one name that you

mentioned and that is William Harvey.

Did you - first, generally, what was the nature of your

operational relationships to William Harvey after this period?

Did you have any?

Mr. Hunt. I never had any, no. In fact, I've only seen

him once in my life, to the best of my recollection.

MI. Baron. As you may know, William Harvey was tasked

in 1961 with setting up an executive action çapability at

the CIA, tasked originally by Richard Bissell to carry out

assassinations if required.

Mr. Baron. And neither of those two men are alive today?

Mr. Hunt. That's right.

in the CIA that could take care of such problems by means of

assassination?

Mr. Hunt. No. My distinct impression and recollection is

the function, if indeed it existed, and I believed it then

to have existed as I do today, was centralized or focused in

Colonel Pash and

Mr. Baron. Now what would have been the formal title

of the unit. that Colonel Pash and

were running?

MI. Hunt. If it had one, I never knew it.

Mr. Baron. Can you add any other detail to the record

on your talk with Colonel Pash and his reaction to your

request that he consider on a general level the planning of

an assassination of a suspected double agent?

Mr. Hunt. Well, as I recall it, my conversation with hin

was a relatively brief one. I stepped in the door, met him,

saw

who I knew briefly, or at least knew him

by sight, and I sat down and I said, we have this problem in

the Albanian branch. We may need somebody liquidated in

Western Germany. Can you handle it if that day comes, or if

it comes to that?

And he seemed a little startled. I have already indicated

that. What I'm trying to do now is to refine my thoughts more

than I did previously when we were taking sort of a wide

swipe at the canvas.

Colonel Pash indicated or said to me that it was a matter

that would have to be approved by higher authority and as

a relatively low ranking officer in those days, I thought he

was probably referring to Frank Wisner. And indeed, he may

have. It never got pushed up to Frank Wisner's level because

there

no direct approach or a request for such approval

was ever made.

I left with the impression that Colonel Pash was glad

that he wasn't going to have any business for me or that he

had successfully deflected whatever approach I might be making

to him because it would give him and

san

opportunity to drink more coffee and to draw their salaries

from the Agency while affecting to do a job that they were

perhaps not equipped to do.

Now again, that impression I had when I left him was at

variance with what I had heard before I came in, where I heard

21

he and

or he at least had been active in West Germany

22

in wet affairs, particularly kidnappings and that sort of

23

thing.

24

25

Mr. Baron. And you carried into his office the impression

that Colonel Pash was a man who could carry off an assassination

Mr. Hunt. No.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever discuss this matter with anyone

other than Colonel Pash?

MI. Hunt. In that context?

Mr. Baron. In the context of assassinations or kidnapping.

MI. Hunt. Well, I wasn't involved in plotting or planning

any kidnappings. Again, I would suggest that I might very

well have gone back to

who was the most interested

individual, because he was responsible at the branch level

gas an operational tool, whereas, I had an overall

political responsibility

And I have described

the background of that, the rubric under which I became

interested in the Albanian problem in the first place, and

then having talked to

Pash, it would have been only natural

for me to have said to

look, I've talked with Pash

and he says it will have to be approved by higher authority.

Now have you gotten, we don't have a body yet, but when you

get a name to put on the target, at that point you will have to

carry the ball and take it on up the line.

Mr. Baron. And you never heard anything further about it?

Mr. Hunt. No, probably because I went within, I think,

a comparatively few weeks off to the Guatemala operation.

Mr. Baron. Did anyone ever mention it to you, say did

ever mention it to you again?

Mr. Hunt. No. I next saw

it would be about '57 or '58, and I had dinner in his home in

Taipei, and I'm quite sure I said at that time, whatever

4

5

happened to Boris Pash, or what do you hear from Boris?

Now he was a rather unusual individual to say the least,

and I don't think

6

told me that he was dead. I don't

know who told me that boris, that Pash died, but whatever

he said, it was, well, he was okay the last time I saw him

and that was the last time we ever discussed it.

10

Mr. Baron. And you didn't discuss this request?

Mr. Hunt. No.

11

MI. Baron. Where did you receive the impression that

12

Colonel Pash was dead?

13

Mr. Hunt. I guess when, either from reading the Lawrence

14

and Oppenheimer book or from the newspapers, from the Crewdson

story. I don't think at the first level when I began recalling

the story, I don't think I was aware that Boris Pash was

dead.

18

19

20

Mr. Baron. In the Crewdsonstory there is an allusion

to the fact that Colonel Pash is probably dead.

Are you saying that that came from Crewdson's research

21

and not from yourself?

22

Mr. Hunt. Oh, yes, that came from Crewdson's research, not

mine.

23

Mr. Baron. This is more than a minor note on the record,

24

Colonel Bash is not dead.

25

Mr. Hunt. Oh, good, I thought he was dead.

my assumption at that time was that authorization by Frank

Wisner would have been all that would have been reguired to

proceed with the project had it ever materialized. That is

the Chief of the Clandestine Services.

Now whether Frank would have been required to go to

Allen Dulles, I rather doubt it. I think it is something that

he would have been able to authorize himself.

Mr. Baron. All right. Let me ask you now before we get

into Colonel Pash's version of the story, which we will,

whether it is possible that you are confusing the time periods

here?

So as not to hold anything back from you, Colonel Pash

has said that the time period has to be off because he

retired from the Agency, or left the Agency in probably late

'51. It's possible that it went into 1952. But he wasn't

with the Agency in any capacity after '52. And in fact, his

status was that of a military officer who had been detailed

to the Agency from approximately 1948 to '52.

Now does that affect your recollection in any way of the

period '54 to '55 as the period when your conversation with

Boris Pash took place?

Mr. Hunt. Well, from 1950 to 1953, I was in Mexico as

Mr. Baron. And where were you from the time that you

joined the Agency until you went to Mexico?

Mr. Hunt. I was a member of the PP staff.

Mr. Baron. Is it possible that your conversation with

Boris Pash about the assassination of a suspected double agent

took place in that time period?

Mr. Hunt. I would have to say it's possible, yes.

Mr. Baron. Would you have been dealing with East

European problems or --

Mr. Hunt. No, I was dealing with West European problems.

Mr. Baron. I'm sorry. Would you have been dealing with

a problem like this one, a problem with a suspected Albanian

double agent in West Germany during that time period?

Mr. Hunt. I can't recall having done so. The west

European Division had its own PP staff officer and he would

have been the one to take it up, whereas my recollection is

that this was generated at a later time when I was in the

Southeast European Division and had a direct reason to become

interested in the matter.

I have to say that it is possible, but I would say maybe

5 percent possible.

• Mr. Baron. And you accord so small a possibility to

the hypothesis that you actually talked to pash about this

problem in '49 or '50 because you were not involved in

operations in West Germany at that point.

Mr. Hunt. No, I was not.

Mr. Hunt. No, no.

He was not.

you in '49 and '50 physically?

Mr. Hunt. Physically I was in the JRK building with the

Mr. Baron. In the later period, '50, '54, and '55, that

you were discussing, did you travel often to West Germany?

Mr. Hunt. No.

Mr. Baron. You were stationed in Washington?.

Mr. Hunt. I was stationed in Washington and from the

period after I left Mexico, which was in, I think, March of '54

16

for about the ensuing year when I left for the Guatemala project,

17

I was in Washington or the SE Europe Division. So I had

sense of the probabilities that this conversation took place

in '54 and '55?

defined functions. And

Do you recall any dealings that you had in your earliest

period of service with the CIA with PB7, now that I've refreshed;

your recollection?

Mr. Hunt. Not as such, no. Does Colonel Pash define

what his functions were in the PB7?

Mr. Baron. Before I answer that one, let me ask you one.

Mr. Baron. This is very helpful.

Do you recall any charters that any of those planning

branches had?

Mr. Hunt. At this juncture, no. I was only aware that,

I think mine was PB2. This is when I first went in in 1949

or 1950. I think that was

gutfit.

MI. Baron. Colonel Pash described the charter of PB7

as giving PBY responsibility for such other functions as the

six other units didn't perform.

Does that square with your recollection of what he was

doing in those early days?

Mr. Hunt. Well, you see, I don't associate Colonel Pash

with the very early days. I associate him with a later period,

24

about three years or five years later.

recollection is that Colonel Pash was said to have come to us.

He was recently assigned in Germany and he had come to us

from there. That was all that I knew.

Mr. Baron.

past week on this subject, said that his recollection of the

charter of PB7 was that it gave PBT responsibility for

assassinations, kidnappings and such other functions as higher

authority may assign or as were not being performed by other

with reali certainty that no such conversation took place and

that even in terms of exploring the possibility of assassination

planning or inquiring into the capability for assassination

planning, he maintains that assassinations were never raised

with him, what do you then have to say about his

testimony?

MI. Hunt. I would have to say that his perceptions and

mine were at variance

and that we were engaged in some sort

of an Aesopian dialogue in which neither of us understood

what the other was saying.

I had no other reason to approach him. I had never heard

of the man except in that particular context.

Mr Baron. And there was no other reason for them

discussing capabilities for an assassination?

Mr. Hunt. That's correct.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of any specific function that

Colonel Pash performed with the CIA after the date of 1952?

Mr. Hunt. Well, my recollection is that I saw him in

'54 and '55 and that's the only specific function that I can

relate him to.

Mr. Baron. Now you have drawn a chart of the PP staff,

Exhibit 4, that locates Colonel Pash and

Mr. Hunt. Is it possible? Yes, I belléve it's possible

Mr. Baron. At what point did OPC merge or was it

transformed?

MI. Hunt. Well, it merged with OSO, I think, in 1953

when I was

Tand i becane

ine.

In Mexico in '53, and

I came out of there in, I think, March of '54, I left Mexico.

By that time the merger had taken place.

Mr. Baron. So is it possible that this chart could have

been a chart of the PP staff as it operated under the OPC

structure, the 453?

MI. Hunt. Yes. In fact, I don't think that there was

any particular change from the PB to the PP era.

MI. Baron. The reason for my own confusion here is that

Colonel Pash and

have both said that at the

point when OPC was merged, or at some point shortly thereafter,

PB7 was abolished and they don't know what became of it.

They say the functions that these seven planning branches

performed were scrambled and reorganized and they were never

sure exactly who carried through the functions that had

previously been assigned to PB?.

unit or branch as it appeared in the PP staff following the

merger, that had the same function and the same personnel as

let's say whatever PB enumerated or numerical designations.

So it's just a question of terminology. I can see that for

chronological purposes you are interested in how I recall it,

• .

whether I recall it by a PB numercial designation or by --

But since I never knew what the Pash-l

unit was designated,

whether it was designated by a word or by a number, it

doesn't help me at all. And for that reason I can't be

of more assistance to you.

Just go see Cölonel Pash. He's in such and such an office

down there.

Mr. Baron. Off the record for a second.

(Discussion off the record)

MI. Baron. For the record now, while we were off the

record we agreed to continue this session a while to get into

one of two other areas. But I have a couple of questions to

tag on to the end of this one.

First of all,

in his testimony to the

Committee, said that he had no recollection of a conversation

with you where he was present, and you discussed assassination

of a double agent, or the planning for such a mission with

Colonel Pash and himself.

Do you, even having heard his testimony, still have a

clear recollection that

was present when you

had this conversation?

2

MI. Hunt. I do, because to the best of my knowledge and

belief, it was the first time that I had met

4

That is, I had seen him in the corridors, but it was the

5

first time that I was able to append a name to the particular

6

individual who I had come to recognize visually.

My memory is further jogged in this respect, that _

8

having identified me as a member of the SE division of the

9

staff, at a later time but not much later, talked to me about

10

the possibility of his being assigned to the SE division.

11

And my recollection of the conversation is that

told

12

me that he was a great friend of

13

and that this friendship should be put to use for the Agency's

14

benefit, and it could be best done by his being transferred

15

to SE division for ultimate assignment to Athens.

16

MI. Baron. Do you have from anything in your experience

17

in the CIA any personal animosity toward Colonel Pash or

involvement in the Manhattan Project and I certainly admired

his contribution to national security in that era.

account of an incident when he was stationed atr

that he

had written a cable to CIA headquarters outlining a propaganda

program because he was involved in propaganda operations at

that point.

And he said, unbeknownst to him, someone else

in his station with the approval of the Chief of Station

attached an extra paragraph to this cable which suggested the

assassination of Chou En Lai in preparation for the Bandoeng

Conference where Chou En Lai was supposed to be an important

spokesman on behalf of many Asian nations.

And the way that

recounted the incident,

he knew nothing about the paragraph that had been attached to

his cable until the reply came back very strongly in the

negative and eventually, a high ranking CIA official came out

to

o reprimand everyone involved in the incident for

suggesting assassination.

is not suggesting that is some basis for personal animosity,

I trust.

Mr. Baron. No. He did say, though, that you might have

had knowledge of that suggestion, although he wasn't sure of

it. He said you were involved at that time in a place where

you might have seen cable traffic like that.

Mr. Hunt. That's quite right, but I never saw that

traffic.

MI. Baron. Let me pick up one last general question for

the moment at least on assassinations.

Do you have any knowledge of even the consideration of

assassinations at high levels of the American governemnt?

In other words, we have been using the term higher

authority and I would like to use it for the moment now to

refer to the level of the DCI or the National Security Council,

the President, his close White House advisors, Cabinet

officials, and the DCI.

Do you have any knowledge of any people at that level

seriously considering assassination planning?

Mr. Hunt. No, none. I think you have to bear in mind

to me and I was surprised when on invasion day Castro was

alive. I now realize from testimony that Harvey and others

have given that the matter had been discussed long before my

arrival on the scene and it was in hand one way or the other.

Mr. Baron. When was your arrival on the scene?

Mr. Hunt. Spring of 1960. I transferred up, I actually

made my trip to. Havana

the summer of 1960, and then we had

the Bay of Pigs invasion the following April. of '61.

Mr. Baron. Now it is my own recollection of our

assassination report that no action was taken to carry out

an assassination plan against Castro as early as the spring

of 1960.

Did something --

MI. Hunt. No. I've giving you, I guess, a bureaucratic

answer. I was officially transferred back to Washington in

the spring of 1960 and I took some leave en route in Spain

Eventually I made my way back to Washington in the spring

and early surmer and got on the scene within a few days of

my actually reporting: into the project managers, i.e., Bissell

and Barnes, who decided I would go down to Havana for a period

of time, and I went down for about a week and came back, and

by that time we were talking maybe July or so.

Mr. Baron. July of '60?

Mr. Hunt. That can't conceivably have been a reference to

Mr. Baron. Why is that?

Mr. Hunt. Because I had not been involved in Cuban

activities for more than three years at that time. I was

purposely isolated from all Cuban activities after the Bay

of Pigs.

Mr. Baron. You said you did operate out of Madrid for a

period of time but it was later than September of '64?

Mr. Hunt. No. Let me clarify that.

I was sent to Madrid in either '64 or '65. I can't

recall which, and I stayed there less than a year.

press publications or press placements or any responsibilities

you may have had for media relations.

Mr. Hunt. After Allen Dulles's resignation and retirement,

I was assigned for about a period of a week to the CA staff

and I then transferred to the newly set up Domestic Operations

Division under Tracy Barnes, which was really the Commercial

Operations Division, although it was never so-called.

I was the first Chief of Covert Action for the Domestic

Operations Division and we inherited as a new division a number

of projects that had been running for a period of time, that

had been run by the commercial staff of the Agency and by a

number of the geographic divisions.

The purpose of turning these ongoing projects over to the

Domestic Operations Division was to centralize contacts with

publishers in the United States for the benefit of geographic

divisions such as the Asian or Far East Division which might

want a book published on

¡for a particular purpose.

They would come to Tracy Barnes with a particular request.

And I should say that the relationship with the Frederick

Praiger Publishing Company had been in existence for quite,

a period of time and I think they were managed by Cord Myer

International Division, if I'm not mistaken, or possibly the

CA staff. But what we received were ongoing operations.

We

were sent the case files for the redosick A.

out of a

Virginia office.:

I had no personal media contacts with American magazines

or newspapers, if that is the thrust of your question.

Mr. Baron. Actually, I'm interested in this whole area,

both contacts with specific reporters or media people dome-

stically or contacts with publishing houses or contacts abroad

in the publishing field.

Mr. Hunt. Well, I've given you the names of the publishing

houses that we had contact with. I did on one occasion meet

and I can't recall the purpose of it, it was a very large

textbook publishing house and their main offices were in

New Jersey. If I had an annual for publishers, I could pull

it out.

But beside from that publishing house, we never did any

business with them. I don't recall of any publishing houses

beyond Predes lak

A

that is trade publishers,

that

we dealt with.

We had our own press agency, Conetneatal press,

which I

imagine you're quite familiar with.

Mr. Hunt. Can you describe the standard mode of

operating with these various publishing outlets?

material? Would you urge them to publish a manuscript they

already had from another source? Would you give them a

manuscript that CIA personnel had written under a pseudonym?

MI. Hunt. I don't think that ever took place, to my

knowledge.

What I recall is

ired Praege? meeting with Tracy Barnes

and me or individually, either in Washington or New York during

this period and saying I have a great book I would love to

publish, but it's not economically feasible, and I think it

would be good for you people abroad for the following reasons.

And we might come up with the differential or we might not.

I don't recall any Agency-created manuscripts that were

sent to

Praeget or for that matter, any other publisher.

I recall we had a lot of accounting problems with

Pragger

and finally we got really almost bogged down in arguments

about back copies. It was a little on the nightmarish side.

We did turn out some good books, but I couldn't give you a

title at this point. But I'm sure that they are a matter of

record within the Agency.

Mr. Baron. What was the nightmarish aspect of it?

Mr. Hunt. Well, apparently, before the project came

under

DOD, it had been handled on a very freewheeling basis by the

previous project managers. "Praeget got everything he wanted

from the Agency in terms of subsidy money and expense money

and publicity money and that sort of thing and when we took

it over it was brought under -- I hesitate to use the term

professional management, but I do so in a qualified sense in

that I was the only one, I guess, who knew anything about the

publishing industry, who had ever been connected with the

project.

So I knew a little about it.

And at that time, with the help of our own commercial

people within the Division, our accountants and auditors and

so forth determined that there were a number of aspects of

our fiduciary relationship with the

praeger company that would

bear greater investigation.

So the relationship from a freewheeling one prior to our

DOD managerial take-over, it became from a freewheeling thing,

it became sort of an unpleasant continuous argument about

dollars and cents, rather than functional matters.

Mr. Baron. Out of what funds at the CIA did these monies

come from that we were giving to Praeger?

Mr. Hunt. I wouldn't have any idea, project money.

Mr. Baron. Who signed off on the project money?

Mr. Hunt. Well, it would depend on how much it cost.

I think that Karamessines could sign off up to $50,000 and

beyond that it had to be signed off on by Helms, I think. That!

my best recollection. And I don't know -- as annual review

was conducted, and of course the division chief had to approve

it.

the ones you've mentioned? In other words, supplying funds

to companies other than the ones you've already mentioned?

Mr. Hunt. I don't know of any. None that I knew of.

I would be very surprised if a memorandum showed up saying

that we were dealing with Random House, for example. I just

don't recall now.

Mr. Baron.

Was there any other aspect to your liaison

with these publishing houses other than their seeking funds

to publish books that you were interested in having published?

Mr. Hunt. Only this, that the USIA was, I think, finally

brought into a formal relationship with DOD, at least my

part of it, and the head of the book division at USIA and I

would meet from time to time and he would indicate that he had

a good one that we really ought to do rather than USIA and

vice versa. And he knew fully of the Praeger relationship.

Mr. Baron. Can you describe the process that you would

go through to ensure the publication of a book that the CIA

was interested in having published? An example that I was

given by somebody on our staff who has been looking into this

was books written by or ghosted for Chinese

branch sort of

would like to have Praeger

publish, and it had to do with the

dispute, the name of which I can't

recall. So the manuscript would have been read by Praeger

or his principal assistant, and he would give an indication

of what he thought the marketability was. And at that point --

well, in this instance, we got the funds

from the Near East

Division. When it came down to that, why should dod, who had

no interest in the

dispute, provide money for

that particular piece of propaganda. So the money would be

transferred somehow from the Near East Division's allocation.

It would be their project, but we would be the managers of it

when it got down to the point of dealing face to

face with

Praeger

on the matter. My office would keep the division

apprised of the project, when publication could be expected,

and so forth.

MI. Baron. Were there any other CIA publishing proprietaries

and Continental?l

than the two you have mentioned,

Mr. Hunt. That I had personal knowledge of within the

Domestic Operations Division, no.

MI. Baron. You qualified that by saying within the

Domestic Operations Division. Were there others?

Mr. Hunt. Because the international operations or Inter-

national Organizational Division under Cord Myer, ran quite a

few

things in conjunction with the Congress for Cultural Freedom,

for example. Radio Free Europe, those things that went on.

cations?

Mr. Hunt. I ghosted a couple of - I'm very reluctant

to go into this, although I have discussed it with John

Crowdson. But this is

another one of those difficult areas

where it's very hard for me to prove.

There came a time in the spring of, I think it was the

spring of about 1969, when the Soviet Russia Division asked

me if I could cause to have published something on the --

by this time I was no longer with the Domestic Operation

Division.

I was with Western Europe - on the increasing use

by the KGB Of

such covers as heroflat and things like that,

and Christ, I hope this doesn't get out.

And so I went to llelms. Howard Osborne was then Chief

of the Division, as I recall. He was late Director of

Security, and this had been staffed out. And I prepared the

article and it appeared in large portions unchanged under the

byline of

And it was not a fabricated article.

It was just information which was supplied which he wrote

somewhat in his own style, and there was a second article which

appeared a month or two months later, and this was done by

Dick Helms.

Mr. Baron. Also under

byline?

Mr. Hunt. Yes. You could understand the difficulties

involved here and I don't need any more enemies. I have plenty.

Mr. Baron. By other people? Was it a general practice

to supply either prefabricated articles or the material for

articles to favorable press contacts in this country?

Mr. Hunt. Well, we know about the

book,

which was largely a cooperative venture with the Agency,

and that was done by the SR Division.

You are aware of that, aren't you?

Now in that case, you see, the SR reached out on its own.

Penkoski! Papers was another example. We had nothing to do

with that in DOD. That was done, again, by SR division.

And

I can understand why.

But basically, in answer to your question, I have given

you everything that I have personal knowledge of.

arrangement.

Frederick Ad

Praeges Organization. I felt that a strict

construction of the CIA charter made the project quite suspect

because if we were doing a book, for example,

Communism,

who was the target? It would have been highly

inappropriate for United States citizens to be the target

of the particular book, and we did a hell of a good book on

Communism. It became about this thick. I can't

formed, which was true, but how much of the Praeger output

actually got abroad for any impact I think is highly arguable.

Now, in the case of contental Pregs, the material was

physically mailed from Washington to foreign targets, the

newspapers, I think particularly the

Agency was a client, The mere fact that the project was

rooted in the United States gave it sort of a credibility

lustre abroad in that particular era. If it came out of

Washington then it was probably okay.

But I - Continental Press had no domestic U.S. papers

as clients. What I'm trying to get at is that DOD handled

operations which were based domestically in the United States,

the commercial operations, and this includes proprietary

airlines and things like that, whose ultimate target was

abroad. The principal target of even a tangential target was

not the United States citizen.

Mr. Baron. But, with anything that was published in

English, the United States citizenry would become a likely

audience for the publication?

Mr. Hunt. A likely audience, definitely.

Mr. Baron. Did you take some sort of steps to make sure

that things that were published in English were kept out of

or away from the American reading public?

Mr. Hunt. It was impossible because Pragger was a

commercial U.S. publisher. His books had to be seen, had to

be reviewed, had to be bought here, had to be read. Again I

say it was a matter of great difficulty. Mr. Barnes resolved

all that philosophically, and I simply carried out the dicta.

Mr. Baron. What was your philosophical opinion of the

danger of propagandizing Americans?

Mr. Hunt. Well, I knew that it was not a part of the

Agency charter, and it was a matter that the USIA looked at.

I talked about it occasionally. The USIA coincidentally had

come under some criticism at that time for subsidizing certain.

publishers in the United States. That became known; I don't

recall how. I discussed with the USIA book man and with

Barnes the danger that we might be criticized for the same

target, or an audience, I should say.

MI. Baron. Were there any precautions taken against

dissemination in America of publications by CIA proprietaries

in English?

Mr. Hunt. Proprietaries, well, my only personal knowledge

is the Continentel Press operation which I say was

simply mailed

out of Washington. That was the only precaution, rather than

our people mailing them themselves.

Mr. Baron. Were any techniques used to prevent

contamina

tion of American intelligence by picking up on things that the

CIA was actually publishing or arranging to have published?

Mr. Hunt. I would assume so, and I would guess that that

would be done in the first instance by the knowledgeability of

the reports officers in the various geographic divisions

at

headquarters who would scan newspapers,.

for example, or they

would receive raw reports from

let's say, and see that

there had been a big sale of a particular book which we had

sponsored, which they knew we had sponsored but nobody else

knew. Of course,

Would have known about

it, t00.

So I would say that it was a pretty good fail-safe.

area of knowledgeability was high. For one thing, I traveled

publicity for the Agency, is that what you imply?

Mr. Baron. Right.

Mr. Hunt. No.

MI. Baron. What about subsidizing non-CIA authors to

write stories of any sort, or books of any sort that the CIA

was interested in having published?

Mr. Hunt. I would say this in a qualified sense. Where

we were subsidizing the author of that book because it was

other words, there was never any face to face contact.

Mr. Baron. Aside from dealing through publishing houses

that you had established contact with, did you deal individually,

with authors who were non-CIA employees?

Mr. Hunt. I did not. I don't think DOD did. I think that

Mr. Baron. Is there anything else that you think we would

MI. Hunt. Well, I think you could get probably a good

deal more information from Cord Myer, who had a lot of that

directly under him when he was Chief of the International

Organizations Division, and of course, he served as Deputy

Chief of Clandestine Services for quite a while. He would

probably have as panoramic knowledge as anybody. I guess he's

undertakings to Cuban leadership and to our own paramilitary

people, and had failed to carry them out.

However, this fact was successfully disguised for a number

of years, but Dulles and Dick Bissell paid the price.

In any events, the Bay of Pigs cost Dulles his leadership

of the Agency, and I had the utmost respect for him. I was

associated with him as an assistant for the special Cuban

Bay of Pigs purposes, for a period of several months prior to,

perhaps six months prior to his eventual retirement.

I had had occasional contacts with him as a

Station yand I had seen him in Japan when he came over there

and we had some discussions. Mr. Dulles brought into the

formal Central Intelligence Agency the same feeling of esprit

de corps that we had all enjoyed in the Office of Strategic

Services, and this was largely lost during the McCone director-

ship. And I think we had some admiral after that, Admiral

Radford, possibly. We got under a group of managers, and the

human element that we had enjoyed in OSS was gone with the

passage of Allen Dulles until Dick Helms came back in. You

see, I'm an unrepentent admirer of Allen Dulles and the way we

used to do business. Why do I say that? Because the way we did

business during Mr. Dullet's directorate was precisely the wav

we did it in oss during General Donovan's creation and directioni

of that organization. In OSS, which was Allan Dulles's trainina,

Exhibit 1

STATEMENT BY B. HOWARD HUNT

A year ago when Congress established the Church Committee, Senator

Baker was quoted as saying that I would be an early witness. I was then free

on Appeal and readily available to testify concerning CIA involvement in

allegedly illegal activities. Moreover, I viewed testifying before the

opportunity

Comdttee as a further/to testify under oath concerning my total non -

Involvement with Messrs Oswald, Bremer and Sirhan, persons with whom my

name has been alanderously and libelously linked in press and electronic

media. Although I had been interviewed previously by the FBI and the Rock-

feller Commission with regard to these allegations a host of assassination

buffs and media advocates continued irresponsibly to associate me with the

deaths of the Kennedy brothers and the crippling of Governor wallace.

My Appeal denied, I re-entered prison in April, 1975. Three weaks

later US Marshals escorted me to Washington DC for what turned out to be a

three-hour Interview with a new watergate Assistant Special Prosecutor. For

a loday period I was lodged at the Leesburg, Va., Ja1l, and finally returned

Via Detroit and Tallahassee where I was imprisoned in the isolation area

before being driven on May 26 to Eglin Federal Prison Camp. On May 27,

Assistant Committee Counsel Michael Madigan telephoned me to say that the

Church Committee wanted to interview se "within the next two weeks". I

apprised Mr. Madigan of Public Law 93-209, TItle 18. Seo.4082(c) Para. 1

(amended) which authorises wintmun security prisoners such as myself to be

furloughed for up to 30 days for purposes of testifying Counsel Madigan

agreed to my testifying on this furlough basia.

Over the sumer, however, I beard nothing further from Mr. Madigan

or his Camdttee associates. Then in mid-September a Washington POST story

alleged that I had been assigned by a lhite House superior to assassdnate

columist Jack Anderson. Senator Church was thereupon quoted as saying

that his Comdttee would Investigate the charges. I valcomed thia apparent

opportunity, for the allegations had gained wide credence while uy own

delayed response appeared only Incompletely in the press. Still, nothing

was heard from the Committee.

In December 1975 John Crewdson of the New York Times Interviewed

me in prison. He asked 1f I knew anything about "CIA assassination capa-

bilitles", and I related to him my encounter with Col, Boris T. Pash. Mr.

Crewdson then inquired whether the Church Committee had Interviewed me.

I responded in terms of the foregoing, noting that I would have testified

about the Pash encounter had I been given the publicized opportunities.

My interview with Mr. Crewdson was published and shortly thereafter my

attorney was contacted by a representative of the Committee.

I consider 1t highly discrininatory that the Condttee 18

willing to have me testify in washington as a furloughed witness.

Purther, the Comdttee's refusal to postpone intervlewing me in prison

unt11 one of two counsel familiar with uy career and affairs is available

places me in a difficult position iith regard to representation by informed

legal counsel. And, as during the Ervin Conndttee hearings ( whose cost in

legal fees to me approached $100, 000) I must again pay legal fees occasioned

by the interest of the Senate in a matter of no discernible benefit to me.

Between last January and April I could freely have traveled to

washington to testify at the pleasure of the Senate. From then on I could

have been furloughed for that purpose and testifled accompanied by customary

counsel who are sot now avallable to me. Nevertheless, in demonstration of

my willingness to cooperato fully with the Senate I agree to be interviewed

under oath today.
