Cuba, ave opposed to the Communist régime of FIDEL CASTRO
and opposed to the presence of Russians in Cuba.

MM T-2 stated that frequently whén a group of*
fishermen gathered, one or moré Russians may be in¢luded
in the group, at which time they would invariably drink more
than the Cubans. If some of the Cominanist Cubans presént ~~
wanted to extend themselves to be Adspitablé to the Russians,
they would sometimes offer the Rudsians Soitething to éat with
their drinks. On occasions this would be’a ¢an of Russian meat.
Thé Russian sailors would invariably refuse thisl-meat with an ~ I

emphatié "No" and say soniéthing which phonetically soundéd Tike

by one of the Ruséian supériors who raised a heavy wrench ~
