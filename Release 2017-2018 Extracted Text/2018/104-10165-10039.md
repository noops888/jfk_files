MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD '

£UBJECT: Relations with Manoio RAY and the {RP i

1. For background see my memorandum of 1Z May 196ly reporting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, banolo promised to ,
come up with a prospectus within approximately ten days! time, after con-
sulting with his leaders in Cuba,

2, On} June 1961 Mr. Barnes called me to say that Mr, Goodwin had
been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT woo asked for immediate financtal -
support for Certain activities of the MRP which would run around $10, 3
1 dollare. Mr. Barnes asked me to contact BETANCOURT for the pur.ose of
ascertaining what the {unde were to be used for, exactly how much nseded, ete.
' Icalle¢ BETANCGURT and he told me that I snould get these details from
CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at room 549 at the Washington Hotel,
Tcalled Eugealo'and made a daia for m6 and Ray Dubsis (Ray Adams ts the
mame he uses with Key and Cisneros) to call upon him. ‘ve called on CISNEROS.
at approximately 1845 boure | June, and he informed us that he had urgent
meed for pesos for use in support of his sabotage and underground activities
in Cuba, He said his people were absoluely witzout funda, needed money for
2, transportation, purchase of #2! rent, air fares for :
and for assisting peogle to get out of prison, He said that it wae
now possible for people to buy their way eut of prison by oribiag ane of the
mzay ‘communist lawyers and judces. He thought that 4v, CG or 60, Lut
would meet immediate needs and that some sort of arrangement should be made
to receive funds = 36,90 moathly or theresboute ~ ona fixed and permanent
basie.

3. We made no commitment to Fugento other than to say that we would
pass his plea along to the interested people, 1 reminded him that we hed aaked
im and Manole to prepare a plan for consideration and that we were atill
waiting for that plea, 1 said I personally doubted that enytning could be dene
until the plan was recaived from RAY. He sald Manolo was planning to came to
Washington on the afternoon of 2 June. with the plan, but that he himself was =‘
having to return to Miami immediately and it was vital he be able to takethe
money with him, arrange in Aifami for purchase of the pesos (at rate of i al}

money slready in Cuba - dollars would be delivered to ownara of the pesos who :
‘are in Miami). I told him I would call him in the morning to let him know how
things stood.

4, Idiecussed our meeting with CISNEROS with Tracy Barnes on the
morning of 2 June. Ik was Tracy‘s opinion, in which Ikeartlly coneur, that
we should put out no money whatsoever until we have had a chance to ezamine
Manolo's plan and to study just what repercussions or ramifications there
would be, policy-wise and otherwise, to a decision 10 aseiet the MRP
eallaterally; that {s, outside the Council and presumably without MIRO's
knowledge or. consent. Since RAY has withdrawn his grous from the Council
with a grea: deal of fanfare, it is most unlik that MIRG would look kindly
en any assistence to RAY, especially since he feels he has a rather firm :
promise from the President to deal only through MIRO. :

5._ RAY, upon arrival in Washington, will presumably take his plan (along
with BETANCOURT) directly to-Mr. Goodwin and I would also presume that :
Goodwin will pass tt down to Tracy and Tracy to us. Ray DuBois, who has
beea Manolo's case officer, is standing by in the event he should be needed.

6. I personally feel very stroagly thet we should do nothing to suzport the ~
plan, whatever it is, until we have received from the White House and the i
Department clear-cut, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall plan. I aleo i
feel that now is the ime, if we are going to aupport the MRP unilaterally, to
insert a non-official cut out into the operation. 1 would recommend that con-
olderation Le given to using Mr. harry Pieper (a 4 AVE contract employee) :
oa this job Harzy is iampermentally suiied, bas a good business head, is :
fluent in Spanieh (lived <8 years in Cuba), is cleared, follows directions, .
completely honest and tremendously conscientious.. It would be harder to i
find a better person, :

7. Also, 1 would like to point out the security risks inherent in any arrange-
mente with the RAY-BETANCOURT-CISNEROS trio. These fellowe have had
easy access to the White House and to the Department, are notorious ior their

_ ‘planned leaks , will probably presume all the Department officials they deal
“with are privy to the arrangement, and belore we know it the whole exile i
community will be well aware that we are providing financial and material eee
Support to the RAY group. [am oot arguing against providing euch eupport, H
but am merely pointing out the real potential for emdarrassnient to us if the
matter le not handled with the greatest of precautions, I {cel they have become
too closely identified with U, S. -officialdom, inctuding myself, and that the
plausible denial aspects, to date at least, are almost non-ealstent.
