"Captain Hamilton indicated that ‘the No. 2 man may
have been the one who accompanied "Meat Ball" to Chicago via
Tacoma, Washington. It is further believed that "Meat Ball"
remained in Tacoma after returning from Chicago and that the
No, 2 man returned to Los Angeles, Upon receiving this
information Director Duffy discussed the matter with Deputy
Superintendent Morris, and made a request that the Syndicated
Crime Unit of the 0.C.D, send a man to Los Angeles to work with
the Los Angeles IntéZligence: Division to gather further infor-
