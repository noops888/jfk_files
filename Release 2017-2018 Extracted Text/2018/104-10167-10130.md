Subject: Viea Aprlication of Wife of Yarcos DI:Z Len=
1, Mr, Messott (1211) told me this mor.ing that State has no
record of the vise aprlicétion of Sra, DIAZ Lanz, If one has bean

submitted to the Anerican Tnbassy in Habana, it has not been forvarded
up here for am advisory opinion, . State has flagged her naze and will

. notify Massett (or tr, Cotter or Mr, Pennington of the sane office) -

vhenever her case is subitted for an opinion, Hae

2, Since current plazs call for her evacuation from Cuba to
Yexico, rather than direct to the U.o., there 4s not the urgency
that there was tefore in getting her a U,S, visa, However, when the
matter ca:es up after her arrival in Mexico, we should expedite the‘

forvarding of her application to State so that processing may zroceed,
