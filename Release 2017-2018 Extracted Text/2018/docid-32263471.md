Harbor. The U.S. issued a "vigorous protest

against the Premier's accusation.

Secretary of State Herter told Cuba's Charge

d'affaires that Castro's implication that the

U.S. was involved in the munitions ship explo-

sion was

'baseless, erroneous, and misleading."

given to the elimination of Fidel Castro."

conference: "

...there is one very disturbing

development that is taking place in Cuba, and

that is that anti-communism is now being made

synonymous with anti-revolution, and that those

who express concern about Communist influence are

now being accused of being anti-revolution, and

anti-Castro..."

US State Department announces that. the US

economic aid program to Cuba will be terminated

on Dec. 1, 1960. US military aid will be termin-

ated in June.

Cuban Government orders two attaches of the US

Embassy in Havanna to leave the country within

coanter revolutionaries."
