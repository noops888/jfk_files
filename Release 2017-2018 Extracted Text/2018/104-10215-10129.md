Re: AMPHODARCH/Arthur G, VAIVADA -

CI Staff notes that training for VAIVADA ig scheduled to comme: on
,the.same date in the sano city sa the training scheduled for .
ERE eee __|,This situation seons inherently

dangerous and unwarranted by the circimstances ag known to CI Staff,
Pending further justification CI Staff cannot concur in the training as
requested; but would of course concur in the training for VAIVADA if the
locale yere shifted to another elty such as New York.

(This 1s. basically an operational or an operational security mtter.
therefore urges that CI/0°S/Vi and CI/OA discuss the problen

with the deak, and resolve it if possible.
defer to CI/OPS AND CI/OA in thig matter.)



&

CI/Ors/#i does not concur with the CI/R-&-A recommendations as set forth for
the following reasons:

1, ‘The security compromise would only stex from tke two BRAC officers
identifyirg the ValVaDa affiliation and trainirg on tetalf of this agency.
This arsears extremely renote as the desk advised there is no indication
that the FRAC officers know VAIVADs either ty name or sight.

2, ‘while VAIVADA is being trained, his wife will be attending citizen
ship classes in D.C. preparing for her citizenship examination before
returning to:Cuba, Consequently, it would ke a financial drain for 7alVaDA
to stay in New York City and his wife in D.c. In addition, certain. ser diem
costs would be incurred by the Case, Officer traveling to New York City to.
fonitor ‘sone of the OTR training,

3. The desk will instruct OTR of this joint training aspect and as °
@ precsutionary measure, request that training sites, hours, ete, do not
overlap, : ?
