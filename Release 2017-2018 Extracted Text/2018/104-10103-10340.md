in Spein-(which:Espinosa entered illegally), Espinosa was in-~
formed that.there is a. plan to:overthrow the Castro regime
and to kill. Castro.and some.of his main’ leaders. The plot is
led by Cubelef andsome ofthe March 13:Movement, plus (I be-
lieve) some military officers; They must move very quickly

. because: more ‘and «more people are. learning of the plot and

there-is growing risk of exposure, ‘They ere anxious to have
some coordination, or -at leeet consultation, with responsible
Americens, .' They ‘are not confident: that ‘they could win an‘all-
out fight against the Cestro forces, and are ‘thinking more in
terms of taking control for a short time (perhaps only a few
hours) ,-killing Castro and his most ‘effective men “(thus
ruining -the Castro movement < forever), end then trying to hold
out..for as -long.as ‘feasible, ‘ It+is essential that they know

later, when. the-coup. is. attempted, Also, they wished to alert

cunning out. Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,
cautiously asking whether there has been some "response",

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off, Meanwhile,
the Cuban who wag waiting in Spain for the answer has had to
xeturn.” Espinosa keeps waitin to ‘hear whether the Americens
will play ball with ‘the’ Cubelds “group. The plot has lasted
for over 18 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very =
soon rio matter whether the Americans “play‘ball" or not. One
vYeagon is that they almost havi’ to go ahead now, for the plot
will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

Espinosa algo referred to a jeweler by the name of
teppeizino (spelling?), located at 47th Street, in New York
City. Teppédino works for CIA and has frequent contact with
the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris, _ The Ambassador regularly dis-
poses of jewelry and othe: valuables made available from Cuba,
He does this through Tepp no. However, the latter fools
CIA, , For example, the Ambassedor agrees to sell for $80,000.
Teppelf{ino informs CIA the price is $110,000, and quietly
pockets the difference, On the other hand, Teppéjdino and
CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for
CIA, but the Ambsesador does know.

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dengerous
situation.of the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level
official in the United States Government unless he receives
at leact some reply from CIA.

Comment:

Espinosa was not: overly tense and did not indulge in his-
trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this
matter further if he did not get some response within the very
near future, I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reli-
ability on the basis of this one conversation, However, if IT
hed to guess at this point I would be inclined to accept most
of what he said about actual events, But of course there are
all sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocation,

In accordance with what we agreed on, while Espinosa was
