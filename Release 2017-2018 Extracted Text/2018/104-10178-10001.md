WIFE HAVE ENTERED THE U-S. WITHIN THE PERIOD WHEN THEIR ALIEN
RE-ENTRY PERMITS WERE VALID, AND IF THEY DESIRE TO RETAIN THEIR STATUS
AS PERNANENT-RESIDENT ALIENS {PRA}. THEY MUST MAKE APPLICATIONS FOR
RETURNING RESIDENT VISAS WITH THE CARACAS CONSULATE. THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT THE VISAS WILL BE ISSUED, SINCE ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO
QUOTA NUMBER INVOLVED, THE PROCESSING IS THE SANE AS ANY OTHER
IMMIGRANT VISAs WITH THE CONSULAR OFFICER HAVING THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO
MAKE THE DETERMINATION AS TO ELIGIBILITY. IF THEY APPLY SOLELY FOR A
TOURIST VISA IN THEIR VENEZUELAN PASSPORT, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR PRA
STATUS. SINCE APPLYING FOR A TOURIST VISA IS PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE
OF Ban QB ABANDONMENT OF PRA STATUS. IF THEY OBTAIN RETURNING

MEMORANDUM FOR: Alien Affairs Officer,
# OPS/LSN
SUBJECT : Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles

1. On 30 June 1974 Luis Clemente POSADA's employment
with the Agency was terminated by mutual consent. At that
time ho was establishing a private investigative agency from
which he expected to earn his livelihood, The Immigration
and Naturalization Service file on POSADA, thorefore, may
now be decontrolled. As of 27 January 1975, POSADA is still

* located in Caracas, Venezuela. .

2. On 12 June 1974 advised that POSADA
had been informed of and s the effect that
termination of his Agency ploy mt will have upon his
resident alien status and gibility for U.S, citizenship,
We have not yet received termination records on POSADA,
probably because is still meeting with hin
regarding settlement of his outstanding U.S. tax liabilities.

Vvauarion

(4) “ WKSCARLET-3. WKSCARLI-T-3 was granted a POA effective
17 January 1972 and an OA effective 17 July 1972. He was first

eatin : fi a
brought to the attention of the Station by WH/Miami. It is difficult
to tell from our files exactly when contact was initiated, but as
early as 1965, Subject was being used by EkH ‘KSCARLET-3 is
currently in the process of ecstablishinp a private investigative
company in Caracas. From_January throuch “arch 1974, when the new
foveranent took over and EKSCARLET-3 was asked to leave his job,

he was the Chief of Gu Uy of Seusira of WKSCARLET, and reported on all
aspects, operations, etc. of that unit. We is now in the process

of being terninated, effective 30 June 1974, by his case officer,
BACHHUBER, due to his lack of access and high profile, WKSCARLET-3
currently receives compensation in the arount of Bs2,000 per month,
Subject was last successfully given an SGSWIRL on 8 May 1973, Since
March 1974, his profile has been relatively high, There have been
two articles in the local press naming him as a BKNERALD agent.

Since those two articles, none have appeared; however, he has several
high powered nersonal enemies in the current government and could
come under political attack at any time. The Station docs not feel
that WKSCARLET-3 presents or will present a Security threat. Ile

has been well treated during his Jong relationship with BKNERALD
which he realizes and is thankful for. Meetings to carry out the
termination are being conducted with strict regard for security.

A safehouse used for part of the period (S/H 48) and costing about
$950, was terminated in March 1974. The only special commitment

with WKSCARLET-3 is a termination payment of Bs6,000,

Indicate The Subject, Project Or
201 File No. In Which Tuts
Form Is To Be Filed.

home phone of WKSCARLET-3 was useful in that it did not revea:

any indications that he was- involved in narcotics trafficking.
Since he also successfully passed his SGSWIRL, and satisfied

the Station in a debriefing that he was not trafficking in 7

Too: wyyv 29 June 1973
FROM: Interrogation Research Diviston :
\
SUBJECT: WSCARLET/S IDENTITY A \ IRDA 72501
BY-DOY. \ aa
BACKGROUND: : i

Subject of this report.fs a KISTONE born citizen of IDEN 8 who
‘thas permanent restdent alfen status in WODUAL. Subject was granted
a renewed OA on 17 July 1972 and he was last SGSWIRLed on 3 Novenber
1971 with favorable results. Subject estimated that he has been
SGSWIRLed approxtnately ten times by BKHERALD and two or three additional

times by the WODUAL Army.

PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE:

\

On 8 May 1973, in IDEN C, Subject was again SGSWIRLed at the
request of his Case Officer, Gabriel J. LABRENZ. The session was
conducted in order to determine 17 Subject has ever been involved in
the {legal drug traffic as alleged by a LNAGON source and also ‘
whether Subject knows anyone {involved in the illegal drug business. .
Subject has a good conmand of the English language and the entire
session was conducted in English. All of the test questfons were
coordinated with LABRENZ fn advance and he remained in an adjoining
room within hearing range. This examiner was introduced to Subject

as BYT} JOHNSCH from HODUAL,

RESULTS?
No indicattons of deception.
SGSWIZL results supported Subject in his contentfons as follows:

1. that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has not
used drugs for non-madicinal reasons. :

2. that, excluding IDEN D, he 1s not acquainted with anyone who
he knows {s involved {n the iTlegal drug traffic. (See
DETAILS for these he wiuspects.")

3. that, excluding what he told us (See OETAILS), he has never
received money or been involved fn the sale, ourchase, or

smuggling of drugs.

4. that, excluding what he told us (See CETAILS), he has never
been asked to participate in the illecal drug traffic.

DETAILS:

Curing the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that he personally
has sunked marijuana on three or four oceastons and-he has sniffed
Cocaine on approximately five occasions in the oast ten years. Sub-
Ject asserted that ‘on. each occaston, he was attending social gatherings
with KSTONE friends andhe felt socially comelled to indulge in
order to please the other participants, He estimated that he knows
approxizately thirty-five people who use cocaine or marijuana. Subject
asserted that his last use of cocaine was Tast month when he visited
WODUAL. SGSWIRL supported Sudject's claim that his personal use of
drugs has not been more extensive,

During the pre-test discussion, Subject asserted that he was not
acquainted with anyone who he inew for certain was tnvolved in drug
trafficking. Subject did list the following IDENS when asked {f he
knew anyone who he “suspected” was involved in trafficking drugs:
IDENS 9, E, F, G, H and I. Subject asserted that his susptctons
were based on rumor and these people have never talked to him about
{legal drugs. After recording reactions to the test question, “Are
you concesling the identity of anyone who you know fs involved in the
Sale or smuggling of drugs?" (Ans. Xo), Subject acknowledged that his
concern for the question was due to the fact that he more than merely
“suspected IDEN D was involved and he was “90% certain,”

during the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that in 1954 or
1955, while fn KMSTONE, he and a friend sold a non-dangerous drug to

a buyer who belfeved it to be cocaine. Subject asserted that he mada
$25.03 from this transaction. Also, wnile in KNSTONE at the Sam

time, Subject stated that a friend, IDEN J, asked him tf he wished
to.participate in the smuggling of cocaine out of Peru. Subject

. advised that he declined the offer. As previously noted, SSSWIRL
résults supported Sudject's contenttons that. his {nvolverent with
dangerous drugs has not been more extensive.

the nature of $3,050,000, but the comptroller general of the republic denied the inror~
mation bocause hia office never had any knowledge of Prieto's assertion.

The affeirs of the aollection of somissions on the purchase of voting machines has
turned into a reel scandal. It will be racalie’ that the proposal to purchase the
Yoting machines in the first place wus a sentation. On that occasion the representatives

Reference:

1. Forwarded herewith are two BNDD ROIs and one telegram
regarding Luis POSADA, The first ROI Prepared by S/A Jose Marin
and dated.6 February 1973 is based on a debricfing of a BNDD
source who identifies POSADA aka "Bambi" as being a source of
supply for narcotics in Venezuela, The Cl also claims that
POSADA, along with Jose Gomez and lumberto TRU » have been
involved in other illegal activity such as dealing in stolen mer-
chandise, counterfeit moncy, and contraband,

Ss

2. The other ROI, prepared by S/A Charles Ry Schaming and
dated 13 March 1973, concerns a de! ricfing of a source who does
not believe that POSADA is involved in narcotics,

3. The third document is BNND Headquarters telegram 1846
of 23 March 1973 (repeated from Miami BNOD) concerning the
debricfling of Jose GO! » the BNDD CI who went sour, GOMEZ"
ig adds little and in the opinion of the Station and BNDD
me is cither.lying and/or not telling the whole truth.
MLZ lists a number of names of Persons he claims to have met
while in Caracas which we do not consider worth a follow up
except that of Colonel Freddic BALBOA RALBOA may possibly be
the unidentified police/security official so frequently seen with
