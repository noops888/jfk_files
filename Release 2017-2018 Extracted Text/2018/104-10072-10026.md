MEMORARDUM FOR THE RECORD

I, The atlached material was part of a soft file entitled

"American Deirctors to the USSR", which was set up by SR/6

(Sagpors) around 1960 and maintained by various SR. components

until ca, 1903. Ine complations were dorived fror a varicty

of sourcos, and contain both classificd and overt data.

2, In the fall uf 1966, the files were turned over to CI

Staff.

in most lnstances, basic information was then abstracted

be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in

dissemications have alroady been made through the US Defecior

Machine Program.
