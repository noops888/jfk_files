courier for-the 26th of July Movement between Miami and
Santiago de Cuba,

2. In late 1958, he was active in obtaining supplies
for Gutesemd Castro at which time he was associated with
Pedro DIAZ Lanz in these activities. After Castro came to

Raul Castro and engaged in the training of militia in the
Santiago de Cuba area, Later in 1959, subject had a falling
out with the Castro regime and by late 1959 was engaged in
anti-Castro activities. During 1960 he was frequently

5. In June,. 1961, subject again came to the attention

pt the Agency ‘thr

]whick
(were intervened.)[ At this time, Jreported that

FIORINI had told Ruby Phillips of the New York Times that
he had 50 men who were willing to engage in commando-type

| raids. in Cuba and asked Miss Phillips to obtain af

U. S. support for. his activities. In August, 1961.
reported to C.I.A. that RORKE and FIORINI were attempting
to obtain funds for an anti-Castro program involving 5,200
men which would operate from off-shore islands, possibly
the British Isles. The program again involved aircraft. and
PI boats. . During November and December of 1961

reported that RORKE and FIORINI were working with ex~Ambassador

Sergio ROJAS and had flown two leaflet operations against.
Cuba, the last being approximately 12 December 1961, On
these flights FIORINI flew one aircraft while RORKE was a
passenger on the other, (On the 12 December flight, one
aircraft crashed at sea and the wife of the American pilot
was causing a fuss due to reported U, S. Government
involvement .in the activity.)

6. By late December, 1961, RORKE and
appeared to have fallen out with ROJAS an reported
that Pedro DIAZ Lanz (who by this time was also associated
with RORKE/FIORINI/ROJAS combination) appeared to have
become ROJAS' military advisor with FIORINI shunted aside.
About this ‘time, when ROJAS had to withdraw from active
anti-Castro activities due to his funds running out, it
appears that FIORINI, Pedro DIAZ Lanz and RORKE formed
their own group and attempted to obtain funds in a variety
of ways. In May, 1962, reported that FIORINI and
DIAZ Lanz, along with 27 other people had departed Florida
in an unnamed boat around the middle of April. They were
to land on one. of the Cuban Cays, return to Florida to
pick up RORKE whereupon all would return to Cuban waters
and commence harassment operations against the Castro
regime. According to’ the U. S. Coast Guard
intercepted the FIORII Lanz expedition while
enroute to Cuba and gently "urged" them to return to
Florida, which they did. Since May this group has been
raising funds for their anti-Castro activities and
reportedly had purchased or could get an aircraft and
also had several boats at their

7. An interesting sidelight is a May, 1960 report
that FIORINI had been trying to line up some University
of Miami radio hams to assist him in setting up a
seaborne/commo system and training othe s in the
operation and maintenance of radio equipment.
