power in early 1959, subject was reportedly working with

Raul Castro and engaged in the training of militia in the

Santiago de Cuba area. Later in 1959, subject had a falling

out with the Castro regime and by late 1959 was engaged in

anti-Castro activities.

During 1960 he was frequently

reported engaged in various anti-Castro activities and once

more was associated with Pedro DIAZ Lanz In these activities.

Subject is a qualified pilot and most of his

activities have revolved around the purchasing of and

planning for the use of various type aircraft in anti-

Castro activities.

of the Agency through

At this time,

JORINI had told Ruby Phillips of the New York Limes tha

he had 50 men who were willing to engage in commando-type

raids in Cuba and asked Miss Phillips to obtain official

U. S. support for his activities. In August, 19611

reported to C.I.A. that RORKE and FIORINI were attempting

to obtain funds for an anti-Castro program involving 5,200

men which would operate from off-ghore islands, possibly

the British Isles.

The program again involved

PT boats. During November and December of 1961

reported that RORKE and FIORINI were working with ex-Ambassador

Sergio ROJAS and had flown two leaflet operations against

Cuba, the last being approximately 12 December 1961.

these flights FIORINI flew one aircraft while RORKE was a

passenger on the other. (On the 12 December flight, one

aircraft crashed at sea and the wife of the American pilot

was causing a russ due to reported u.S. Government

involvement In the activity.

By late December, 1961, RORKE and FLORINI

appeared to have fallen out with ROJAS and

reported

that Pedro DIAZ Lanz (who by this time was also associated

with RORKE/FIORINI/ROJAS combination) appeared to have

become ROJAS' military advisor with FIORINI shunted aside.

About this time, when ROJAS had to withdraw from active

anti-Castro activities due to his funds running out, it

appears that FIORINI, Pedro DIAZ Lanz and RORKE formed

their own group and

attempted to obtain funds in a variety

An interesting sidelight is a May, 1960 report

that FIORINI had been trying to line up some University

of Miami radio hams to assist him in setting up a

seaborne/commo system and training others in the

operation and maintenance of radio equipment.
