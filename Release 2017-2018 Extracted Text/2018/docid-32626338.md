THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCE

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY

After three turbulent

years, the Congo is entering a new period of

political construction. The eventual departure of UN military forces will

terminate on-the-spot responsibility for the maintenance of order. Au-

thority over the entire Congo is now exercised by a government of un-

questionable legality. But serious problems remain in the organization

of the emerging polity.

To investigate the socio-political hurdles facing the Congo, an INR

team, comprising M. Crawford Young, a consultant from Harvard Uni-

versity, and Edward J. Streator, Jr. of INR, visited 14 of the Congo's

21 provincial capitals in June-July 1963. Commenting on this initiative,

Ambassador Gullion wrote recently that "...the idea of a Departmental

officer working in tandem with an academic area specialist seems to me

a good one. This kind of thing has been done by the French very ef-

fectively. I judge from the work of the Streator-Young team that it can be

equally useful to us.!!

This Policy Research Study is the product of this collaboration be-

tween a Departmental officer and a member of the academic community.

An abstract of the study accompanies this memorandum.

ABSTRACT

THE CONGO: A STUDY IN POLITICAL

DYNAMICS

1. A modern and virulent form of tribalism

will continue to dominate Congolese politics.

Tribalism lies squarely athwart every dimen-

sion of political behavior. But ethnicity in the

Congo is not a phenomenon of the primeval

forest. In the cities, tribal origin provided a

focus for social organization. The elites of the

cities extended this renewed sense of ethnic

identity to their tribal homelands, where it

served to rally support for emerging political

cial fragmentation. In 1960 only four political

movements of any

significance were not pri-

marily ethnic. Since independence all political

parties have

been subject to

serious ethnic

2. The new constitution now under discussion

will perpetuate unwieldy institutions that ham-

per effective government. A

commission is considering a draft constitution

prepared by UN experts, together with pro-

submitted by Katanga and a conference

of presidents of provincial assemblies. The

UN draft preserves the essential features of the

Loi Fondamentale, the Congo's present con-

stitution which ranks with the most unsuitable

organic. laws in existence. Most other African

states which followed classical forms

dentialism and single parties, which appear to

mentary framework.

auconomy, but does not by any means realistic-

ally reflect the present and likely distribution

of power between the center and the provinces.

It preserves the principle of strong central

central power. The result will doubtless be to

sharp hostility among local leaders

government which will have

serious difficulty in supplying needed national

leadership.

3. The new provinces are likely to persist

as

the basis

of internal organization.

The

creation of 21 new provinces has transformed

the character of the Congolese polity. Although

ethnic factors are

important, only seven of

the new provinces are ethnically homogeneous;

and four have one predominant group. In 15 of

the 21 provinces

there is a single dominant

political party,

and in many the party has a

strong ethnic identity. Traditional tribal struc-

are significant in 11 provinces.

Secessionism, a spectre haunting many Afri-

can presidential palaces, is endemic in several

regions of the Congo. Although Katanga has

been returned to the fold, latent secessionism

persists there and in other areas on the coun-

try's periphery.

The phenomenon of fragmentation is more

recent than the impulse to secessionism, al-

though it derives

from

common

roots.

The

emergence after independence ofthree de facto

the general breakdown of

authority reinforced the movement to create

The paternity of the new

provinces usually lay with elites in the urban

centers whose aspirations for leadership in

areas of origin were frustrated within

the framework of the six provinces inherited

from the colonial period. They accordingly in-

voked ethnic-regionalist arguments to

popular support for the

formation of new

provinces. After Parliament established cri-

teria for new provinces in April 1962, a rash

of new entities were approved.

tioning with varying success. Four can be con-

sidered to function very well. Five have reason-

ably operative governments.

are unstable. The

festering problem of territories disputed be-

tween two or more provinces remains to be

solved, and several of the provinces show signs

of further fragmentation.

The budgetary cost of creating the new

provinces has been high. About 150 new minis-

ters and their parasitic entourages are lined

up at the pay window each month. And yet,

welcome the new

provinces. Before emergence of the new units,

five of the six former provinces had ceased

functioning. The new entities are more repre-

sentative of local opinion. They frequently have

governments of experienced technicians, re-

gional pride to defend, more limited area,

and imperfect, yet better,

ethnic cohesion.

Very real benefits in acquisition of political

and administrative skills are accruing in the

provinces. In many areas the institutions fun-

5. The Congolese bureaucracy will continue

to be handicapped by the lack of experienced

and technically qualified personnel; but in the

provinces it provides a strong backbone of

local administrative continuity. In the colonial

period, the bureaucracy,

untrammeled in the

exercise of power, penetrated and

golese elite was shaped in the subaltern ranks

of the administration, it was excluded from

all top echelons of the civil service until 19.59.

implications for the moderates around Prime

Minister Adoula who seek to establish a na-

tional party. They must deal with provincial

leaders who stand astride the lines of political

communication with the electorate. Although

government may apply certain

pressures on the provinces to obtain support

for a party under Adoula, the provinces re-

tain most of the trump cards. Under these cir-

cumstances, an emerging national party would

at the summit be, in effect, a loose coalition

of Leopoldville and provincial leaders.

It is likely that a moderate national party

of this sort would emerge with a narrow ma-

in Parliament. However, an

electoral campaign would run the risk ofcrea-

ting a serious security problem in many areas

at a time when tranquility is returning to much

of the country. Further, a moderate party

of national scope might labor under the onus

of identification with the American Embassy.

Conceivably,

a radical opposition movement

might be built around an anti-American theme,

offering opportunities for Soviet involvement.

These risks

would be much diminished if

elections were to be postponed until 1965,

allowing time for provincial and central

government institutions to shake down further,

the hard political bargaining neces-

sary to launch á moderate national party. If the

tide of opinion

continues to favor elections in

1964, even a mediocre moderate national party

would at least enhance the electoral prospects

of moderate candidates.

the country. Though the ANC committed bloody

atrocities in the first two years of independ-

ence, the growing authority of ANC Commander

Mobutu has increased control by the central

government over the ANC. Recent incidents in-

volving the ANC do not constitute evidence of

generalized

indiscipline. Rather, the ANC,

except in

ex-Kasai

and southern Katanga, has

proved to be a positive element in the political

system. It has developed a nucleus of officers

of real ability. It has retained the principle of

ethnic scrambline,

which

operates

to

im-

munize it against local political influences and

to give it a commitment to the nation as a whole.

In many areas it is capable of acting as an ade-

quate constabulary. The ANC retraining pro-

auspices may consolidate recent advances to-

reliable constabulary capable of maintaining

lomestic order and preserving the supremacy

of central power.

The United States, the UN, and other

donors, including Belgium, have contributed

massive technical and economic support to the

since

independence.

The shortage of

Congolese technical personnel and capital re-

sources will persist for the foreseeable future.

UN seeks to

reduce its role. The United States to date has

paid the lion's share, but wants to cut back

its

contribution.

Belgium,

the most

likely

candidate to increase aid to its former colony,

is

reluctant to shoulder more. Though an in-

formal UN-US-Belgian consortium of assist-

ance

appears the most desirable formula for

sharing

responsibility, the

Belgians to date

have been

reluctant to discuss forthrightly

ÍNTRODUCTION

After three turbulent years, Congolese independence is slowly ceasing

to be a world crisis. With the end of the Katanga secession in January

1963, the Congo was removed as a major cold war issue. The eventual

departure of UN military forces will terminate international responsi-

bility for the maintenance of order. Authority over the entire Congo is

now exercised by a government of unquestionable legality.

There is no African state where the US commitment is greater, both

in prestige and money, than in the Congo. The re-establishment of the

unity of the young republic, albeit fragile, was accomplished only through

a successful diplomatic effort of great magnitude.

Unity and legality are necessary, but not sufficient, requisites for the

future political viability of the Congo. This study examines the emerging

political system in the Congo, with a view toward clarifying possible

alternatives in the pursuit of political stability. This would permit the

harnessing of the Congo's substantial

ecönomic resources to the ends

of development and, in the process, vindicate the massive US engagement

in the 1960 rescue operation.

The essential elements in the post-independence political equilibrium

have now emerged with sufficient clarity to bear analysis. We ex-

amine the sociological coordinates, institutional framework, bureau-

cracy, political parties, and coercive instruments. We have found it diffi-

cult to

strike a balance between generalization useful to policy-making

and a reasonable accurate rendering of the complexities of the situation.

If

we

have

erred

on

the

side of simplification, we have done so de-

liberately in the interest of readability.

Education

At least a feigned interest in the priesthood

was for a long period the only path to post-

primary education. Consequently the Roman

Catholic Church in the Congo has developed

about 500 African priests and 10 Congolese

bishops, the most numerous indigenous

in

country. The President of

Province, Pierre Mambaya, is a former

priest; the Vice-President of Sankuru,

Abbé

Athanase Djadi, has played an active political

role since

1960 with

the permission of the

hierarchy.

Many others, including President

Joseph Kasavubu, received secondary educa-

tions in the seminaries.

Except

for

religious training,

secondary

and higher

education

became available .only

after World War II. The first non-theological

university student,

Thomas Kanza,

was en-

rolled in 1952.

The Catholic

University

of

Lovanium opened its doors in 1954, the State

University of Elisabethville in 1956; and the

Ford Foundation sponsored the Ecole Nationale

de Droit et d'Administration (ENDA) beginning

1961. Belgian policy produced a broadly

sased but truncated educational pyramid.

Cnormous numbers have had some rudimentary

primary instruction, and very few advanced

training. By 1959 there were approximately

1,500,000 students in primary schools, and only

30,000 in secondary, technical, and higher in-

stitutions. Those with post-secondary training

in 1960 included 30 university graduates, 500

priests, 130 medical assistants, 250 agricul-

tural technicians, 30 administrative special-

20 social workers, and 15 veterinary

assistants.

A significant portion of the modern elite was

employed in the educational system. There

were in 1960 about 44,000 primary

teachers. Although many of these had no more

than a primary education, they, enjoyed con-

living standard of the mass of the population.

By contrast, the "politicians" became con-

spicuously affluent, thereby producing a sharp

sense

of alienation by the mass from the

political elite.

Paradoxically, a popular

nostalgia

for colonialism developed--not, of

course, for a return to the myriad vexations

of European rule, but for the order and rela-

tive economic prosperity of "le temps des

belges." Thus, the norms and values of both

ruler and ruled in the Congo vary import-

antly from most post-colonial African politi-

•cal systems. The absence of an articulated

nationalist ideology

to

supplant the

values

, of the colonial system resulted in a retreat

to the bureaucratic norms which characterized

the Belgian administration, and in a lack of

political structure.

II. ETHNICITY

No analysis of the emerging political sys-

tem in the Congo can escape the elusive problem

of "tribalism," or ethnicity, which lies squarely

athwart every dimension of political behavior.

A transcendent issue for the Congolese

since the "steel grid of colonialism" was re-

moved, ethnicity threatens the nation's con-

tinued existence. Symptomatic of

ordial importance are the

litical movements, with ethnic names: Abako-

Alliance des Bakongo; Unimo-Union des Mon-

go; Unerga-Union des Warega. No reader of

any Congolese newspaper can

fail to be 'im-

pressed by the extent to which political dis-

course has adopted an ethnic lexicon, contrary

to most experience elsewhere in Africa.

National integration tops the agenda

all tropical African

states. Almost all contain the germs of conflict

porated within their artificial boundaries. How-

ever, all other new African states so far have

contained the problem within tolerable limits.

In many cases, independence was

under the tutelage of a single party. In others,

as Nigeria and Uganda, ingenious con-

were devised to en-

sure a balance between major ethnic compo-

authoritarianism

Kenya comes close to the Congo in the extent

to which ethnic conflicts have dominated the

political process. The Congo, however, lacks

all three solutions: viable political organiza-

tions, a workable constitution, or a government

enough to impose authoritarian meas-

The Modern Brand of Tribalism

It is initially tempting

to approach the

ethnic problem by establishing an analytical

equated respectively with

progress. The very term 'tribalism" is tainted

by an implication of retrogression. But ethni-

city in the Congo is not

a phenomenon of

the primeval forest. The bloody conflict be-

Lulua and Baluba at Luluabourg was in

no sense a throwback to the misty, pre-colon-

ing. Colonial rule not only

form of ethnicity develops. It

does not involve a group bound in a patterned

rather a solidarity

display their

ethnic origin in the language

ables others "immediately to fit their neigh-

bors and acquaintances into categories which

determine the mode of behavior towards them."

According to Mitchell,

social interaction, i.e., the first significant

characteristic to

which any African reacts in

Despite the emergence in the urban

vironment of new, non-ethnic prestige

status strata, Mitchell argues,

"there is a

constant flow of newcomers

from the various rural districts from which

the Copperbelt draws its labor supplies. They

are not immediately absorbed into the pres-

system which could possibly supply an

alternative principle of social interaction. In-

stead their own ethnic distinctiveness which

for granted in the rural areas is

into relief by

plicity of tribes with whom they are cast into

association. Its

importance to them is

exaggerated, and it becomes the basis on which

Urban Influences

As elsewhere in Africa, the focal points of

centers,

phenomena have been

tribalism," a reductive process fusing vaguely

reductive process is completed when the in-

his relations with other groups, the new label

which others have assigned to him. The im-

mon urban experiences, mainly in

Ethnic "Nationalism"

Related to the new ethnic solidarity systems

emerged in the urban environment was

the birth in

the cities of an aggressive ethnic

nationalism,

especially among

large groups

with a sense of their own history, such as

he Bakongo. The Bakongo were endowed with

a potent historic myth which embellished on

the ancient Bakongo kingdom at San Salvador (in

Angola). However, the kingdom

sensions. Reassertion of Bakongo unity was

initiated by intellectuals in Leopoldville in

reaction to grievances suffered in the capital.

example of highly developed ethnic conscious-

This vast group,

2,000,000 people and covering a large part of

six former provinces. A remarkable sense of

cultural identity had been preserved over this

huge area. All were conscious of having

and spoke similar languages. However, the

modern articulation of their latent sense of

"Mongohood" resulted from the

frustrations of Mongo migrants to the cities.

attached to the Mongo. He wrote,

but remains latent as long as it is not obliged

to externalize itself before

the seeds of renewed

ethnic self-consciousness were

on fertile terrain in the ethnic homelands.

Examples of the Successful Assertion

o1 Ethnic Solidarity

For the Congo as a whole, the three tribal

groups most successful in

collectively ad-

vancing their ambitions have been the Bakongo,

the Baluba, and the complex of riverain peo-

ples (Bobangi, Lokele, and others) who have

been labelled "Bangala" in Leopoldville. These

three groups, although they represent no more

20 per cent of the population, almost

definitely have furnished a majority of uni-

students. Since World

War II the

advantages of

entry into the modern sector

have become abundantly clear to virtually all

groups, and those which found them-

selves outstripped by others became intensely

frustrated. Groups with

an established elite

provided the schoolmasters and company per-

directors. Tribes with less influence

or less favored could find daily corrobora-

the sequence of po-

developments in the Congo served to

enhance the importance of the ethnic element

in political behavior. Until 1959, political or-

the victors served to heighten ethnic tensions.

A curious paradox placed in the vanguard

of militant nationalism an ethnic movement,

the Abako organization of the Bakongo tribe.

The first overt nationalist act occurred in

1954, when the Abako publicly nominated

Mukongo for the post of Chief of Leopoldville's

African quarter, based on an alleged authority

to speak for. "80 per cent of the Leopoldville

population."8 In 1956 the Abako issued the first

demand for immediate independence,

1959 was the first tolaunch a civil disobedience

appeal. Thus the Congolese nationalist move-

ment bore ethnic birthmarks because of the

exclusive tribal character of the Abako. Other

groups could not join Abako and were forced

to found other, opposing groups.

secondary schools, could not fail to win the

sympathy of the Congolese students.

our Belgian friends, but we can't help saying

that if the union between Flemings and Wal-

loons were conceived

almost interminable quarrels which have often

broken forth

have been avoided."

Ethnicity as a Political Expedient

The dangers of the ethnic appeal were less

well appreciated in the Congo than in other

countries, where nationalist political goals and

were more carefully elaborated. The

abrupt collapse of Belgian resistance and the

tumultuous

contest for

fragmented Congolese nationalist move-

ment were an inevitable incitement to follow

the shortest path to success, the ethnic appeal.

The atmosphere of crisis and insecurity

in which the 1960 elections

took place added

impetus to ethnic self-awareness. Times of

emergency and violence tend to shift frames of

reference to ethnic and raciallines. There was

in 1960 a crescendo of uncertainty in many

areas. A number of groups, both African and

European, began arming.

The future

for

all

posterity

seemed to be resolving

itself in a

cataclysmic contest; elections were to settle

whether Mongo or Ngombe ruled in Coquilhat-

ville, whether Baluba or Lulua dominated Kasai.

The ethnic pattern had thus been established,

and thereafter politics fitted the mold. Ethni-

city and politics fed upon each other and have

been mutually reinforcing in the first years of

independence. By early 1961, the debate on

the

formation of new provinces was in full

swing.

the demand for

fragmentation arose from the

political leadership rather than from the mass;

however, once the ethnic question was asked,

disputed territories keep the ethnic issue alive.

In 1960 only four political movements of any

significance were not primarily ethnic: Par-

tional Congolais/Lumumba (MNC/L), Centre

PSA, a split in Kwilu provincial leadership,

between Kamitatu and Gizenga, was per-

support was derived from his own Bapende

tribe and from the Bambunda followers of his

lieutenants, Pierre Mulele and Gabriel Yumbu.

The Bambala,

Bangongo,

and most of the

smaller groups rallied to Kamitatu.

In the MNC/L party, even in 1960, the vot-

ing support in the areas of Maniema, Sankuru,

darity of the Ankutshu-Anamongo group, of

which Lumumba's Batetela tribe was a part.

a simple anachronism or retreat to

traditionalism; rather it is a dynamic element,

begotten by the forces of modernization. Just

how it will evolve in the coming years is

difficult to forecast. The one safe prediction

is that it will not simply disappear.

THE LOI FONDAMENTALE AND LIKELY SUCCESSORS

The Loi Fondamentale

cept those of the Abako party and both wings

A scissors-and paste digest of the Belgian

constitution, the Loi Fondamentale ranks

the worst organic laws in existence. It was a

by product of the extraordinary haste of power

transfer in

Congo. The Brussels Round

Table Conference of January-February 1960,

which decided upon independence for June 30,

an intellectual tabula rasa on the

of government the Congọ

needed. The

Round Table provided some general mandates,

and turned over the task

and Belgians. After a cursory examination of

They prepared a document in six weeks which

maverick features as co-opted senators. 10With

apparently little serious thought by

Belgians or Congolese

problems of stable government for a complex

and underdeveloped polity such as the Congo,

they endowed the country with a bi-cameral

legislature, a parliamentary regime,

double executive comprising a chief of state

and a prime minister.

It would be naive to

suggest that an inade-

quate constitutional framework is at the heart

of the Congo's difficulties. But given the prob-

lems this political community must overcome

in governing itself, the added burden of a woe-

fully inadequate legal framework is a heavy

one.

The Belgian tradition is highly legalistic.

"Legality" remains a hallowed political value in

the Congo, no matter how frequently honored

in the breach. An attachment to legality is

surely an ideal to be fostered, yet it is diffi-

cult to sustain when careful observance leads

down blind alleys.

Principal Defects in the

Loi Fondamentale

The

present constitutional structure

has

several major defects:

1. Parliamentary power. A parliamentary

regime would make

sense in the Congo were

there meaningful political groups represented

in the legislature. But the utter disorgani-

level of parliamentary

corum and efficiency has risen substantially

1960, as shown by even a cursory ex-

amination of the debates. Yet placing the locus /

of power in Parliament, rather than in the

executive branch under a presidential regime,

really means

government often is

either paralyzed, or it acts in defiance of the

letter of the constitution. Either is excessively

high tribute to pay to literal application of

classical liberal democratic theory to the

Congo.

2. Dual executive authority. The very office

of chief of

state is an anomaly. It derived

from the Belgian hope, later shown hollow, of

Kasavubu's act, although defensible politically,

created a nearly insoluble constitutional im-

passe that lasted almost a year. Since the in-

vestiture of the Adoula government, Kasavubu

has been content with a quasi-monarchical role

of largely ceremonial dimensions. A more ac-

tive president, however, could find himself in

constant conflict with the prime minister. The

duality of authority has grave latent dangers.

3. Legislative review. No clear way is sug-

gested for obtaining a definitive interpretation

of the law. Article 51 provides that 'authori-

tative interpretation of laws belongs only

Parliament," but adds, "for the interpretation

of the Loi Fondamentale, the Parliament can

solicit the Belgian Parliament's interpre-

tation." This article arises from the Belgian

constitutional

that only the legislator

can know his intent in the formulation of a law,

therefore he alone can resolve a disputed

interpretation. However, the Congolese Parlia-

ment has taken

advantage of the ambiguity in

Article 51 to

assert its right to give authori-

tative interpretation to the Loi Fondamentale

and has used this clause to justify free-wheel-

ing

parliamentary

actions.

Though

the Loi

Fondamentale provided for the establishment of

a Constitutional Court, this requires a special

law, which has yet to be voted. Were the Con-

stitutional Court in existence, its powers likely

would be limited to judging whether new laws

conform to the Loi Fondamentale, arbitrating

central-provincial conflicts,

charges of administrative torts. Nowhere is it

suggested that the Court would be empowered

to interpret the Loi Fondamentale as

such.

4. "States of exception." Among other conse-

quences

of

ambiguity

has been

a highly

ir-

regular procedure under

which a chamber of

Parliament adopts

resolution

establishing

a "state of exception" in a province, in effect

seeking central government assistance to over-

throw the existing

provincial

government.

Should the executive branch fail to implement

the resolution, the weapon of interpellation and

censure

could be invoked against the

sponsible minister. Although the !state of ex-

ception" procedure has at times been justified,

in

other instances

it

and damaging.

5. Censure votes. Another example of am-

biguity may

be found in the Gizenga case. Al-

though Parliament stripped Gizenga of his im-

munities by an overwhelming vote in January

1962 and he was later imprisoned, there have

been several votes since December 1962 calling

for

his release.

in June 1963,

Parliament voted

to restore his immunity.

Justice Minister Justin Bomboko brilliantly de-

fended the government's argument that this was

a case sub judice, which only

awaited parliamentary creation of a tribunal

competent to try him. But nothing could have

stopped one chamber

from enforcing its own

interpretation by simply removing the minister

in a censure vote.

6. Amendments. Another crucial defect is a

loophole in the amendment process. Though a

complicated procedure was specified for fram-

ing a new constitution, provision was made for

amendment of the Loi Fondamentale itself by a

two-thirds vote of both houses.

There are

therefore no entrenched provisions beyond the

reach of amendment. A number of changes have

already been voted,

including a complete al-

of the ratification process for a new

constitution. The requirement that elections be

held in 1964 similarly could be removed by

parliamentary vote.

The UN Draft Constitution

The Loi Fondamentale was intended to be

only a provisional instrument. The Belgians and

Congolese believed in 1960 that only the Con-

golese could define their basic law, and that

its content should not be a subject of bargaining

observers-es-

relationship. Finally,

presidents of the provincial assemblies met

in Coquilhatville and prepared an extensive

series of proposed amendments to the

mission began to discuss the UN draft, pro-

methodically article by article. By

June 1963 they had completed consideratior

of about 40 of the 212 articles.. The com-

mission work is continuing

during the

parliamentary vacation of 1963, and Parlia-

ment is scheduled to reconvene as

assembly in September

Parliamentary sources maintain that a draft

will be complete by early 1964. It is likely

to conform largely to the UN draft.

Proposed Organization of the

Central Government

Much concern has been expressed over the

central

government-provincial

relationships

outlined in the UN draft constitution, but very

little over the structure of the centralgovern-

ment itself. Generally, the application of cer-.

tain European procedural concepts

of demo-

cracy to the

organization of the central gov-

ernment seems

excessive and insufficiently

adapted to Congolese needs. Specifically, the

parliamentary system provided in the UN draft

appears to disperse the authority of the central

government too greatly for effective direction

of the country.

It is ironic that much of the pressure for re-

taining the parliamentary system in the Congo

It derives from

the artificial character of nearly all African

on political developments in the

three countries involved.

province goes

back further than 1959

in the Congo, and these initiatives were really

only given a decisive fillip by the tensions of

the 1960 electoral campaign and the immediate

pre-independence period.

Two factors made inescapable the formation

of new provinces:

1) The emergence of three de

facto new

provinces in the immediate wake of independ-

ence: Kongo Central, South Kasai, and North

Katanga. The first was a result of the strong

desire of the Bakongo for their own political

entity;

the second

ensued from the calvary

of the Kasai Baluba and the forced regrouping

of some

250,000

refugees

in the

confines

of the Baluba

ethnic homeland; and

the third

riposte to the unilateral

Conakat act of secession.

2) The general breakdown of authority, which

gave autonomist movements

the opportunity

to establish

their claims at a time when

central authority

was powerless to resist

and incapable of exercising leadership.

With

Pandora's box opened by the three

many areas, such as Kwilu and

Kasai, precólonial migration patterns produced

a population mosaic of infinite intricacy, which

the techniques of gerrymander could not

unscramble.

Three prerequisites for provincial status

were finally adopted:

could concoct "imperative reasons" for ignor-

Characteristics of the New Provinces :

Table D in the appendix to this report

provides summary profiles of the character-

of the new provinces. Map D, also in

• the appendix, shows

the provinces and ethnic

groups.

Although ethnic factors were important in

the establishment of

the new

provinces,

• it

is not really adequate to describe them

as

"tribal provinces," as Table D clearly shows.

Only seven can be considered really ethnically

homogeneous, and four

more have one group

which

tends to predominate. Again, the ambi-

güity of the concept of ethnic homogeneity

must be stressed. For example, though one

might argue that North Katanga was a Baluba

province

since most of the peoples inhabiting

the zone belong

at least peripherally to the

Luba culture cluster,

a subjective sense of

"Lubahood" is

shared

by only a portion

of

them. The province, therefore, cannot engender

loyalty

by

explicitly

stressing

a Baluba

character.

Some provinces classifiable as ethnically

homogeneous have experienced

some of the

most serious tribal disorders in recent months.

For example, Kwango is essentially a Bayaka

tribal province, but

grave disturbances have

there are two kinds of Batetela: those who

was tribal war, involving a large number of

deaths and the destruction of a sizeable part

of the capital city of Lodja:

seven of the new provinces seek to

invoke ethnic loyalty as a fundamental ethos!?

At the other extreme are Haut Congo, Kivu

Central, and Katanga Oriental, which became

provinces after being deserted by neighboring

areas and will have a difficult time developing

a sense of common purpose.

Another hypothesis occasionally advanced

to explain the new provinces is that they

are one-party provinces. It

one could argue that, rather

consecrated the disintegration of a once

potent and supra-ethnic party. In Uélé, for

example, MNC/L is virtually excluded from

territories are unrepresented in the provincial

government. A secession plot might be mounted

by such Babua leaders as Christophe Gbenye

or Egide Bocheley-Davidson, who are certain

to be frozen out if new elections are organized

under the aegis of the present Uélé government.

4) Kibali-Ituri: There is some disposition

to rally to Uélé. The incumbent president,

Manzikala, is strongly opposed to this, and

it is unlikely to happen as long as he retains

that Nord-Kivu will eventually agree to re-

ethnic groups, Bakusu and Warega. Presi-

after the end of the Katanga secession,

there was some sentiment for a reunification

of the old Katanga province. Balubakatleaders

Leopoldville,

tended to support this. However, important

elements in Nord-Katanga vigorously oppose

the move, and the splitting of South Katanga

into two provinces would seem to complicate

future reunification efforts.

a diverse collection of ethnic groups

and Lulua. The government is weak and cor-

whose access to the modern world was through

administration.

In a profound way, it established the values,

the Congo's leadership.

In any political system, the technical capac-

determinant of the efficacy of government.

For these reasons, we examine the nature of

the Congolese civil service.

The Organization and Effectiveness of the

The civil service may be examined at two

service is much better than generally believed.

are likely to presume chaotic incompetence.

For this reason, it is important to emphasize

that the general level of administrative ability

in the Congo is not sharply below the African

norm. This is faint but necessary praise.

Moreover, the caliber of members of the

central administration in the Congo stands

out in relation to other elements in

between the ministers and the civil service

are often poor. Venerable functionaries have

inherited the "apolitical", mores of the colonial

¡administration and tend to resent the "upstart"

The method of nominating territorial admin-

the balance of power

between the center and

the provinces.

The colonial practice was

to

assign a functionary from the central govern-

turn to a district, whence he would be assigned

to a territory. The province, however, had the

final authority in naming the territorialadmin-

istrators. This procedure after independence

took on entirely new meaning. The provinces

A profile of the structure of the Congolese

these institutions stood in sharp contract to

Conclusions

In sum, the heavily bureaucratic tradition

of the Belgian colonial system

has

left an

indelible mark on the Congolese state. For

all its

shortcomings, the bureaucracy

is a

crucial element in the political system. Es-

pecially in the countryside, the position of the

territorial service is paramount. To be sure,

the administrators are handicapped by com-

munications problems and by their own limi-

tations in training and policy-making experi-

ence. But there are no effective challengers

to the power they hold. The limits of their

authority are the limits of effective organi-

zation of the political society.

At the center, decision-making and initia-

tion of policy are not really in the hands of

the bureaucracy. But the limits of the capacity

of the civil service to carry out

policy are the boundaries of the effectiveness

of government. Political ideologies never took

root in the Congo, and there is accordingly

no alternative offered for the Belgian-instilled

administrative criteria

of good government:

public order and increased production.

At the same time, the bureaucracy poses

some vexing problems. It has won for itself

a level of remuneration beyond the capacity

of the country to pay. The Congo cannot be

viable until some adjustment takes place in

the pay scale, perhaps through a depreciation

in the Congolese franc. As one observer has

wryly commented, the once -militant civil serv-

VI. POLITICS AND PARTIES:

THE PROSPECTS AND RISKS OF ELECTIONS IN 1964

. The Fragile Roots of Nationalism

The most fundamental characteristic of the

lateness of its emergence. Throughout British

and French colonial Africa national political

parties were beginning to function by the end

of World War II. In the Congo overt political

movements began only in 1957 and were not

launched in earnest until 1959. Lack of ex-

perience is a trait common to all Congolese

political parties.

This difference between the Congo and other

parts of independent Africa is largely explained

by the character of the Belgian administration,

was highly authoritarian compared with

its British and French counterparts. For ex-

ample, a vigorous and colorful African press

back to 1858 in Ghana. In the Ivory

Coast, L'Eclaireur de la Côte d'Ivoire was

launched in 1935. On the other hand, the first

independent Congolese papers, Quinze and Con-

go, began only in 1957 and were quickly sup-

the Congo, African (or even European) politi-

cal movements were prohibited, as indeed was

any kind of political activity. The low level

political sophistication

absence of an awakening sense of nationalism

among the mass made it possible for the Belgian

authorities to forestall any African nationalist

movement.

The complete isolation from external in-

the Congolese elite was another

key factor. For decades the emerging

speech in Brazzaville in August

1958, announcing that independence was avail-

for the asking, had sharp repercussions

across the river in Leopoldville. The Brussels

Exposition provided an opportunity for large

numbers of educated Congolese to visit Europe.

In the first decade following World War II,

however, both the Belgians and the Congolese

considered that the most important issue con-

fronting the colony was the status satisfaction

of the new elite. Colonial debate focused on

the "immatriculation" card (a device to grant

Africans limited access to certain privileges

reserved to Europeans), equal status in the

discrimination. Mrs.

Robeson, after a session with Leopoldville's

elite during her 1947 African tour

commented, "The evolues did not seem visibly

interested in independence, nor emancipation.

They were

There was no explicitly nationalist statement

of a

comprehensive character until the Con-

science Africaine Manifesto of August 1956, a

document of Catholic antecedents.

This pro-

voked an almost immediate riposte by the Al-

liance des Bakongos (Abako)

of the Bas-

Congo, which for the first time used the slogan

of "immediate independence." The next major

statement was Joseph Kasavubu's inaugural

speech as burgomaster of Dendale commune

in Leopoldville in April 1958. The word "in-

dependence" was not publicly uttered beyond

the confines of Leopoldville until after the riots

there in January 1959.

The Messianic Sects

Symptomatic of the high degree of frustra-

tion with the colonial situation and the lack of

a nationalist outlet for these feelings was the

prevalence of radical messianic sects. These

symbols, both animistic

and Christian. Al-

Associational Experience

Related to the late emergence of nationalism

the mediocre level of pre-nationalist as-

sociational experience. Group activity involv-

ing Africans prior to the emergence of parties

took at least five different forms:

1) Unions. These suffered under legal

union prior to 1959 was the Association de

metropolitan parties began establishing po-

clienteles.

The Failure of Lumumbism

• Another symptom of alienation between the

politicians

and the mass has been the failure

of efforts after Lumumba's death to construct

a "Lumumbist bloc," a mass nationalist move-

ment akin to the radical African nationalist

model. Lumumba's

strategy at the outset had

been to weld a national coalition of parties--

Provincial Political Consolidation

A development of major significance in recent

months is the rapid consolidation of a series

of local power clusters centered on the new

provincial institutions.

Where a homogeneous

leadership

has

emerged, it

is

challengeable

from

virtually

un-

The

provinces have three major trumpcards:

1) Control of the police forces.

These are

frequently overt political instruments.

2) Control of the local administration. Ter-

ritorial

administrators

are

named

by the

provinces; the territorial administrator is the

unchallenged authority in his zone.

3) Monopoly of direct contact with

the

population at large.

This is not significant in

the normal process of decision-making in

Leopoldville. However, if

and

when

national

elections are held, it would be a critically

important asset.

The ability of the central government to

intervene in the provinces grows in situa-

and Youth

are accepted on consultative bodies of an of-

ficial character, but do not participate in real

collective bargaining, except in the govern-

ment-level negotiations establishing the legal

minimum wage (which is the salary in fact

received by the majority of workers).

The major unions are:

1) Union des Travailleurs Congolais, (UTC).

This union has the largest membership and

probably must be rated the most important. It

is of Catholic inspiration and

was initially

organized under the patronage of the Belgian

Catholic union. Its leader, Andre Bo-Boliko,

is a keenly intelligent and able person.

2) Confédération des Syndicats Libres Con-

golais (CSLC). This is a very close second

to the UTC in importance. It is accused by

its opponents of being remote-controlled by

ister. CSLC is an ICFTU member.

3) Fédération

this is the stepchild of the largest Belgian

union, the EGTB, associated with the Socialist

Party. There have been periodic hopes that

it would rally to the CSLC, but to date it re-

mains separate. It suffers from the absence

of a single national secretariat. At the top,

there are merely two regional offices.

Though union leadership has been effective

in articulating the widespread resentment of

the privileges of the politician class, unions

probably do not have the capability of mo-

bilizing widespread

the reverse is much less true.

In

a number of cases, provincial officials

any of these Pandora's boxes.

The leaders of the new provincial govern-

ments share a sense of isolation from the

sources of power at Leopoldville. Although

some provinces have surrogates in Leopold-

ville, including several with

Adoula's Cabinet, most feel their represen-

tation in Parliament inadequate, largely as a

result of the failure of the parliamentarians

elected in 1960 to maintain contacts at the pro-

vincial level. Thus, the provincial govern-

ments anticipate elections as a means of re-

representatives owing

allegiance to the new

provincial regimes. With this new blood, the

provinces hope to increase their leverage in

Leopoldville and their share of central govern-

ment patronage. The impulse to elections at

the provincial level is virtually unanimous.

There is as well surprising depth of attach-

ment by the Congolese elite to precepts of

Western democratic theory. The Congolese are

aware that their country has been the

principle arguments advanced in favor of such

a movement may be summarizedas follows:

1) Stability in most African states has been

achieved through the mechanism of a single

dominant national party, which performs the

key functions of national integration and con-

tainment of disparate local and ethnic loyalities.

2) The Adoula government has the desirable

characteristics

of. moderation

and respon-

sibility. However, it lacks any structure cap-

able of engendering popular support for its

policies; there is no linkage between the rulers

and ruled, except through the administrative

structures of the state.

This could be supplied

the organization of a national party

committed to the same principles of govern-

ment as the Adoula regime..

3) The Adoula government is

subject to

continual harassment and is frequently para-

by a fragmented

local movements. It was not capable of ef-

fective, united action.

Recent Efforts to Create a Moderate

National Party

The need for a national party is felt by

a large segment of the present Congolese

leadership. Several efforts are underway:

1) Defense Minister Jerome Anany has been

travelling extensively in recent weeks, es-

tablishing contacts with local leaders. Anany

was born in Lisala (Moyen Congo), but his

parents were from Kivu. He was elected

Senator from Kivu in 1960, on a non-party

list. He considers Moyen Congo his bastion,

but there is reason to doubt how much genuine

support he has in that area, or whether he is

accepted as

"native son." His choice of

electoral constituency in 1960

would suggest the contrary. Anany's prospec-

tive party is the Parti Démocratique Congo-

lais (PDC)--already dubbed by its enemies

des Députes Corrompus."

position as Defense Minister is a key one. It

is not yet clear whether he considers

PDC "his" party,

or whether his efforts are

on behalf of the Prime Minister.

not yet firmly committed

himself to the national party project,

as one he would

lead. For all his fine qualities, Adoula

seem to have the magnetism necessary

to make his personality the central feature

of the party's image. It seems unlikely that

he would lend his active support to the effort

to develop a national

party unless he were

the acknowledged leader.

Chief Nendaka has also been

and seeking to mold

force into an

weapon for the political campaign. Nendaka

wants to be elected as

Aketi home district in Uélé Province, and

then move to the Ministry of the Interior. It

is not clear to what extent Nendaka's efforts

are coordinated with those of Anany.

4) The "Binza group" feels that it, or its

members,

the organizing com-

mittee for a national party. The strength of

this caucus derives, however, from its power

in Leopoldville, and not from its

support. It is not clear whether Nen-

leader. He conditions his participation on

satisfactory place near the center of the po-

litical constellation. He recognizes, however,

that his source of political strength is regional

(Kwilu), and he probably has no illusions that

he himself could organize a national party.

The recent PSA/K Congress in Kikwit (June

1963) was explicitly designed to renovate the

to recreate its rural apparatus,

looking toward the electoral campaign.

6 Alphonse Kithima, leader of one of the

major labor unions, Confederation des Syn-

dicats Libres Congolais (CSLC), has initiated

the Mouvement pour la Defense des Intérets

du Peuple, based upon his union organization.

This structure probably does not have enorm-

ous potential, but reflects the tendency of the

diverse elements in Adoula's entourage to

anticipate the formation of a national party

by launching their own movements as quickly

possible.

Adoula's approval of the project,

likely to become a link in any national party

under Adoula.

Numerous other lesser organizations need

not be catalogued. Individually, they are of very

little significance; collectively, they are im-

portant symptoms of the strong potential for

fragmentation inherent in the Congolese polity.

These scattered efforts to achieve a national

party may indicate that Adoula has given his

tacit assent to the simultaneous pursuit of

several initiatives. If so,

this may place

once again in the position of the in-

broker between these

The Bargaining Power of the Provinces

In organizing a national movement from

Leopoldville, one comes hard

against the in-

controvertible fact that, in most areas, access

to the electorate must pass through the groups

ganize a party in competition with the Abako

Central; an

authorization of President

Mambaya would be summarily dealt with.

Therefore, the only possible procedure is to

negotiations with provincial, au-

thorities and

solicit their cooperation. Col-

laboration would come at a price. Provincial

authorities will certainly demand substantial

concessions to their list of provincial needs.

Further, the cooperation probably would be

in

the form of an electoral alliance, rather

than absorption into a national movement,

which would then be able to communicate di-

rectly with the masses. The kind of national

It

would be a loose coalition at the summit level

of a series of provincially based power centers.

Possible Coercive Instruments

of the Central Government Leaders

The central government possesses certain

potential instruments of coercion in the prov-

inces which might be of some use to national

party organizers. These include:

1) The ANC. The ANC has

sufficient level

of discipline and effectiveness

as a consta-

bulary in most areas for it to be a potentially

decisive force. Mobutu's concept of the ANC's

role in the elections is not clear. He has tried

hard to preserve the "apolitical" tradition of

the ANC, and this approach is shared by most

officers. Accordingly, he will

resist requests for overt commit-

ANC to one side or the other.

However, the army probably would prevent or

limit the use of intimidation and violence by

opposition

groups in the campaign. In some

areas, these techniques played an important

role for parties like MNC/L. The ANC could be

provinces where political

exists, depending upon how it chose

to intervene to halt likely disorders.

2) Sureté. In Nendaka's hands, this is an

overtly political instrument. The Sûreté has

the power of arrest and clandestine means

of intervening

in local situations. It is

under central control. The caliber

stantially from very good to mediocre.

3) Subsidy. The major part of the pro-

vincial budget comes from the central gov-

ernment, although this will change somewhat

under the new constitution. Theoretically, the

threat of a subsidy reduction should be a potent

weapon. However, an agreed, automatic formula

for calculating the subsidy level exists, and

there is not much room for central government

manipulation. In general, experience to date

rather than

leverage upon the provinces, the central.gov-

ernment permits those provinces which levy

the most effective demands or make the most

fearsome threats to extract the largest shares.

4) Import quotas. At the moment, these are

centrally determined. There is more room for

arbitrary decision and manipulation, but the

above remarks apply as well to import quotas

as to subsidies in general.

5) Patronage. The central government theo-

retically could reward well-behaved provinces

works projects. The

situation limits the potential of this

approach, unless large

eign aid were

received.

possibilities, the central government can offer

jobs in Leopoldville to meritorious political

workers, but in fact controls very few appoint-

ments in the provinces. The central Civil Serv-

ice Ministry

still controls the promotion and

ranking of civil servants, on which basis pay

are calculated. There is, however, no

way of stopping the provinces from making

their own promotions and paying the persons

concerned from their own resources.

o) Judiciar

7. Pending adoption of the new

constitution,

the judicial system is still con-

trolled by the central government. In many

provinces, highly incriminating dossiers on a

number of political figures

(Bomboko)

could decide to pursue some of

cases. The judiciary values its neu-

trality, however, and would resist becoming

conscious political instrument. Further,

there are a good many moonlight entrepre-

A prerequisite for this

procedure is access to a faction in the pro-

vincial assembly. Where there is near unity

behind provincial leadership, this ploy is ex-

cluded. Unusual opportunities for intervention

The Electoral Law

The 1960 elections were organized under

the electoral law of March 23, 1960. The

law established the administrative districts

electoral units for the Chamber of Repre-

sentatives,

with the number of seats in a

district ranging from 4 to 12. For the pro-

vincial assemblies,

the territory served as

the

electoral

district,

with

an

average of

3 or 4 deputies elected per territory. The

choice of a proportional representation sys-

tem of voting for several seats for each elec-

toral unit was dictated in part by the ex-

perience of the 1957 urban elections. They had

In the final analysis, control of the elections

probably will lie with provincial and local

authorities. The stake which the political elite

of the country has in the elections cannot

be over-emphasized. Because of its impact

on the outcome of elections, the electoral law

certainly

will be a major concern for all po-

litical leaders.

Conclusions

A new electoral campaign would run the

risk of creating

in many areas

of the country at a time when

tranquility is at last returning to almost the

nation. Disorder is not likely where

effective provincial administrations are op-

erating. However, there is sufficient political

confusion or latent local hostility to create

a real threat to security in the following

provinces: Lac Leopold

I1, Moyen Congo,

Hant Congo, Maniema, Kivu Central, Katanga

Oriental, Nord-Katanga, Sud-Congo (Lualaba);

Sankuru, Sud-Kasai,

Luluabourg (Kasai Cen-

tral), and Unité Kasaienne. In addition, nearly

disputed territories would be powder

kegs during an electoral campaign.

It is not likely that there would be eruptions

at all these points. However,

even a few of them would severely strain the

ANC. Especially dangerous, in our view, is

problem stemming from the complete political

vacuum in both Katanga Oriental (East Katanga)

and Sud-Congo (Lualaba). It is not at all certain

that this danger will have been removed by

latter enjoy sitting athwart the lines of com-

government. Thus, if it comes into

existence, the national party will be a loose

between Leopoldville leaders and

leaders of provincial governments.

A moderate national party

would probably

labor under the onus of identification with

the American Embassy-even if there were

active US encouragement and support for

for electoral involvement.

districts make

it impossible to know

exactly how many representatives each prov-

on a sea of approximation:

The Shock of Independence

The events of independence shook the Congo-

whole of its officer corps. Soon thereafter,

the emergence of four separate armies re-

flected the political fragmentation of the Congo.

In 1960-1961 leaderless bands of mutineers

committed atrocities

without number.

ditional concessions were made in the months

before independence, in the face of a growing

malaise in the army. However, these were

hopelessly out of touch with the psychological

requirements of power transfer. The new of-

sent to different parts of the Congo to superin-

for the most part a

crucial to the power contest between Limumb-

ist elements,

seeking to regroup at Stanley-

ville, and those elements disposed to accept

the authority of the College of Commissioners

at Leopoldville. The contest lasted from Sep-

tember to November 1960, with the Lumumbists

finally winning.

On November 26, 1960, General

Lundula arrived in Stanleyville and took com-

mand. Shortly thereafter, the Gizenga govern-

ment announced its claim to be the

sole legal

authority, with Lundula and the 3rd groupement

under its orders. Thus, by the end

of 1960, the

ANC had broken into two groups, one at Stanley -

under Mobutu.

allegiance to Stanleyville undoubtedly grew

from a sincere conviction that legality lay with

the Stanleyville government. In Stanleyville he

faced several handicaps:

1) Although Leopoldville continued paying

this insurrectionary group, wages often did

not reach outlying units, especially in Kivu,

North Katanga, and northeast Kasai.

2) Lundula's control over much of his

Reunification of the ANC

One of the most difficult problems in

re-

unifying the Congo has been knitting together

the military fragments. In the case of the two

wings of the ANC, a major obstacle was the

question

of who

was

the "legal" Com-

mander, Lundula or Mobutu. The government

of reconcilation emerging from the Lovanium

parliament did not immediately resolve the

problem. It was not until November 1961 that

Lundula agreed to

come to Leopoldville to

accept Mobutu's authority as Commander.

When he did, however; the end was in sight

for Gizenga's campaign to re-establish a dis-

sident power center at Stanleyville. In De-

d) Acts of savagery in Luluabourg, Kindu,

and Kongolo, November 1961-January 1962.

These are all directly linked with the abortive

ANC invasion of Katanga. In Luluabourg

search for a radio set which had been trans-

mitting to Katanga information on ANC troop

movements degenerated into a drunken orgy

of rape and looting. In Kindu 13 Italian avia-

tors, suspected of being Belgian parachutists,

were slaughtered, cut into small pieces, and

eaten (the present Minister of Finance in the

government reportedly

partook of the feast). In Kongolo 16 Catholic

were massacred, purportedly

for their Conakat sympathies. These incidents

demonstrated the danger constituted by ANC

units when under the tensions of combat. They

had a pervasive fear of "'Belgian paratroopers"

and European mercenaries.

area of the ANC

following

Katanga in January 1963, there has been a

series of incidents,

deep-seated fear and hostility toward Ka-

3) Recent ANC Incidents.

In 1963 there have been three major incidents

the ANC: at Kakenge (near Mweka)

in Unité Kasaienne, in the area west of the

Bushimaya River in

Sud-Kasai, and in Boma,

Kongo Central.

a) Kakenge. There were a reported 400

death, including those of the two Europeans,

in these incidents. The blame for this violence

Lulua Chief Kalamba

and the present Lulua-

bourg government. Kalamba, in a radio speech

September 17, called for the Lulua to press

outward in several directions to expand the

Luluabourg provincial boundaries. Two Euro-

murdered by Kalamba's thugs.

The UN magistrate in Luluabourg has in his

a letter from Luluabourg Presi-

an ocolyte of Kalamba,

ordering the assassination. When armed bands

youth pressed toward the Mweka

area, which had been awarded to Unité Kasai-

enne province, the ANC intervened. A patrol

ambushed, and several

killed. At this point,

the ANC intervention

became brutal. But the brutality

voked, and the action was clearly in preserva-

tion of law and order and to put down an

insurrectionary act.

b) Sud-Kasai. In January 1963 ANC patrols

dispatched to deal with armed bands

of youthful supporters of former South Kasai

that were roaming

the

countryside. (Their arms reportedly had been

provided by Luluabourg Minister Mukenge, a

close relative of Chief Kalamba of Lulua-

ranked the territoral administrator. Mutual

smoldering grievances ignited. The transfer

of the local ANC

commander and the

of joint local police-ANC patrols

seem to have considerably reduced the tension.

These recent incidents do not constitute evi-

of generalized indiscipline in the army.

There is a sharp contrast between the inci-

dents in Kasai, where the ANC was guilty of

an excess of brutality in defense of legally

constituted government, and the anarchic acts

of 1960-1961, where the ANC was a threat

to legal government.

4) Political Assassination.

There was a wave of murders in Elisabeth-

ville, Bakwanga,

and Stanleyville in February

1961. Although

there had been

a number of

crimes of this nature in late 1960, the virtually

simultaneous execution of 26 leading figures

in early 1961 represented the real low point

of the Congo crisis. Since then, this technique

has generally ceased to be used, except for

two members of Tshombe's cabinet who died

under mysterious circumstances. A symptom

of the total impasse of the political system at

that time, the situation has now clearly changed.

5) Ethnic Clashes

Tribal disorders on a massive and serious

scale have been restricted mainly to ex-Kasai

animosity, with peripheral

groups drawn into the maelstrom. The bulk of

the disorders have been on the fringes of the

homelands of these two large, aggressive

groups.

The most recent example of disorder in this

category occurred in Sankuru Province in May

1963. The hostilities there involved two sub-

groups of the Batetela ethnic

cluster, whose

Southern Katanga is the only area

of the

Congo where security remains a matter of im-

mediate concern. Hostility between the ANC

and

the Katanga Europeans remains sharp,

and there is a threat of serious incidents,

possibly leading to a European exodus when

the UN troop buffer is removed.

ANC Retraining

Plans for retraining the ANC are finally

crystallizing. A retraining program was drawn

up by a US

Special Military Advisory Team

headed by Col. Michael Greene. 22 Although the

program has gone through several'subsequent

metamorphoses, many of its salient features

Following abortive efforts to obtain from the

UN a commitment to coordinate ANC retrain-

ing, an ad hos consortium was devised to carry

out the program. Belgium agreed to provide

over 100 officers to train the ANC; Israel

undertook to provide paratroop instruction in

Israel; and the

United States will furnish

equipment and other material support. Several

other

countries, including Italy, interested

in aiding in ANC and other military training,

subsequently may make firm commitments.

Because under current plans the bulk of the

training personnel will be supplied by Belgium,

the program

presumably will bear a strong

Belgian stamp. As a result of prolonged un-

extent of international

cooperation in the scheme, the precise details

have remained vague. However, there appar-

ently has been considerable divergence of views

among interested parties as to how the retrain-

ing would operate. On one hand, a simple rein-

forcement of technical, consultative personnel

in headquarters positions was recommended.

On the other; the placement of Belgian officers

in the regular command structure of the ANC,

even down to the small unit level, has been

proposed. Until very recently, the Belgian

tions without engendering very serious tensions

among both the officers and the troops.

Congolese officers are insecure in their new

status and are keenly opposed to any infringe-

ment of their prerogatives. Therefore, a care-

ful delineation of the Belgian officers' relation-

ships with the ANC officer corps is crucial.

A model of effective operation is provided by

Col. Dekoster in Stanleyville. He never left in

1960, and he has

worked unobtrusively

Col. Mulamba, the Stanleyville commander. It

is generally recognized that he made a major

contribution to the re-establishment of disci-

in the 3rd groupement, without ever

seeking to intervene directly.

The notion of retraining, we believe, should

be viewed in perspective. At times "retraining"

seems to have ben discussed as a redemptive

process to produce a profound metamorphosis

in the ANC. It is probably a mistake, however,

the program in terms of a "before"

and "after" caricature. Without the program

the army has already made considerable pro-

gress: toward restoring its discipline

developing a command structure. The more

intensive dose of technical assistance, which

the retraining program essentially entails, will

probably make a real contribution to the accele-

ration of this regenerative process. However,

the ANC will not become

effective army. The ANC will continue

brutal-as it

was under the Belgian admin-

istration. Its interventions will result in un-

necessarily high casualties among the civilian

population. Retraining's chief accomplishment

is likely to be consolidation of the gains al-

ready made in placing in the hands of the central

government

reliable

constabulary

force

capable of maintaining domestic order and pre-

serving the supremacy of central power.

The ANC Officer Corps

The ANC officer corps is a relatively un-

known. elite group of considerable potential

political importance. The officers constitute

a very special sociological group. Both before

and after independence they have been very

far removed from the administrative

geoisie which rules in the political spheres.

In the, Force Publique, the career noncoms

lived with their families

in military camps.

They were seldom posted to their home areas

and generally were transferred too frequently

The Police

The other important instrument of coercion

available in the Congo is the provincial police.

The one element of force in the hands of

provincial authorities, the police are a major

factor in the evolving relationship between

the provinces and the central government.

The present provincial police

outgrowth of the pre-independence Territorial

Police. Organized in 1926 as a corps distinct

from the Force Publique, and specially trained

for the responsibilities normally vested in a

police force,

it reflected the growing com-

plexity of colonial society after the pacifica-

tion phase. With the emergence of provincial

urban centers, the necessity arose for a force

trained in

the enforcement of criminal law

and in policing the rapidly expanding African

quarters surrounding

the European outposts.

Two important procedures were adopted that

have decisively affected the role of the police

in the independent Congo:

1) The police forces were placed under the

direct authority of the provincial

rather than the Governor-General, thus es-

tablishing the tradition of a provincial, rather

than a national, role.

2) Recruitment has been local rather than

national. Unlike the ANC, the police forces

are directly related to the populations which

they serve.

During the colonial period, a detachment of

commissioner and under the authority of the

Territorial Administrator, was posted at each

territorial seat. Unarmed local police als

were recruited and commanded by the chiefs o1

the Circonscriptions Indigènes (CI). These de-

tachments were in addition to the Force Pub-

lique platoons, and the exact delineation of the

respective jurisdictions of the territorial and

was a sharp increase. By early 1960 the force

disorders of independence hit the police harder

than it did the army. Nearly all the police

commissioners-except those in Katanga-left.

Thus the force was as leaderless as the ANC,

although not as a result of its own insub-

ordination. Belgian sources who have worked

with the

police estimate that half the 1960

force was absorbed into the ANC during

the

large-scale army recruitment in 1960-1962.

The army offered better and more regular

pay. African police commissioners were desig-

nated by the provincial Ministers of the

In-

terior, frequently on a political basis. In this

respect the police stand in sharp contrast to

the ANC, where political criteria played very

little role in the massive promotions of 1960.

The present status and possible reorganiza-

tion of the police form the subject of a recent

1963 in the Congo. Although re-

figures on present strength are un-

available, the AID team estimates there are

about 22,000 police. Most of the police, unlike

the army, have been recruited since 1960 and

have never known the training or discipline

of the old Territorial Police. Dressed in

shabby uniforms

frequently under in-

competent or

venal leadership, the police are

a sorry force.

provincial authorities have

used police forces

as an avowedly political

instrument. One

provincial level.

Two other solutions to the police problem

forcement to the ANC; and 2) federalization

of the police force. Both these solutions ap-

Similarly, in the confused and

uncertain political climate of Luluabourg, the

UN civilian representative has marshalled the

representatives

of central

government au-

thority-the ANC Commander, Surete Chief,

and District Attorney--into a peace-keeping

team which has had to contend mainly with

the Luluabourg government, probably the most

corrupt provincial administration in the Congo.

Although the effectiveness of the UN civilian

presence varies, it appears generally good.

Insofar as the UN civil representatives serve

as buffers between competing elements of the

population, their presence aids greatly in the

maintenance of order. If possible, their serv-

ices should be retained, particularly in Lulua-

bourg, Kindu, Albertville, and Elisabethville.

Consideration might also be given to placing

resident UN representatives in troubled San-

kuru and Unité Kasaienne Provinces.

The UN military presence. Since the end

of Katanga's secession, UN troop strength has

been reduced to 7,475, including

1,983 ad-

support troops (June 24, 1963).

hand,

and the Belgian and African popu-

lations

and former Katanga gendarmes,

shed. If possible, UN or other international

forces

should be retained in Katanga well into

1964. By that time, it is possible that po-

litical leadership

will have emerged, the ANC

will have improved its

effectiveness, and all

elements of the population will be acclimated

to the new situation. Also enhancing the need

for a foreign military presence in southern

Katanga until well into 1964 is the prospect

of national

companied by serious disorders.

Belgium

Since the Congo's independence, the Bel-

gian Government has restricted its aid

tribution to servicing

the Congo's external.

debt and to technical assistance involving about

1,200 teachers for the Congo and scholarships

for Congolese in Belgium. Total Belgian Gov-

expenditures

for Congo aid were

about $53,000,000

1962 and

may reach

$72,000,000 in 1963. Belgian assistance be-

yond this amount apparently is

sideration in the wake of the recent settle-

ment of the contentieux, outstanding financial

the Congo and Belgian Gov-

ernments that date from independence.

The Belgian Government also has agreed

to furnish military personnel for retraining

the ANC. The importance of ANC retraining

is crucial, particularly in view of the eventual

withdrawal of UN forces, and should have the

priority among

foreign assistance

respect to increased Belgian public

responsibility in the Congo, the Belgian Gov-

ernment apparently has an ambivalent attitude,

compounded by the

failure to plan ahead in

terms of contingencies. Although the Belgian

private stake in the Congo is vast, the Bel-

gian Government is reluctant

to take steps

to

increase

its technical and financial

as-

sistance as long as the United States or other

nations are willing to bear the principal burden.

In the

absence of any other effective lever to

obtain an increase in the Belgian aid contribu-

tion, a reduction in the US contribution might

serve to heighten Belgian private and official

interest in covering the shortfall. A risk in

this essentially negative approach is that the

Belgians may react too late to meet Congo-

lese needs. If the United States then failed to

recover the situation, the way might be opened

to renewed Soviet involvement. It is clear that

the Belgians, at least for the moment, are being

less than frank with the United States about their

intentions in the Congo, and the possibility of a

really close Belgian-US aid consortium may

consequently be somewhat limited.

The role of Union Miniere in the Katanga

secession diverted attention from the

sub-

stantial constructive contributions of Bel-

gian private individuals and concerns to emerg-

stability in other areas of the Congo. All

but a few of the major Belgian-financed agri-

cultural, industrial, and mining enterprises

are in operation, some at levels of produc-

tion approaching or above the pre-independ-

ence period. Although handicapped by short-

ages of spare parts, vehicles, and imported

for sale to

enterprises and their managements

have provided surprising economic continuity.

In most areas, plantation and plant managers

and local governments are cooperating closely

to increase productivity. Relations between

the indigenous population and Belgian man-

cordial; outside of southern

Katanga there are few

reports of significant

Belgo-Congolese animosities. Particularly in

the provinces enjoying relatively stable gov-

stated their desire

for additional Belgian investment. Where Bel-

farmers and

small businessmen have

failed to resume their enterprises since 1960,

provincial leaders especially have

renewed Belgian activity. Un-

employment stemming from the closing down of

some Belgian operations has created serious

for Congolese political leaders.

Nearly 50,000 Belgians are estimated to

be in the Congo. Some observers have ex-

pressed the belief that this number would not

increase significantly in the future, since most

who left in 1960 had either returned or found

satisfactory employment in

where. Were conditions more settled, and were

special inducements offered, it might be pos-

sible to attract more Belgian nationals to the

Congo for employment in both the private and

public sectors.

The United States

The pivotal role played in the Congo by the

United States has paid off handsomely interms

of American prestige, not only in the Congo,

but also in the rest of Africa. As long as Con-

golese attention centered on the Katanga seces-

sion, the US image was positive. However, in

the wake of the Katanga victory, the American

presence in the Congo is receiving new scru-

tiny, through an optic untinted by the rosy

aura of the Katanga success.

At Leopoldville the US presence is linked

closely with the Adoula

provincial leaders' misunderstanding of the

import program is complete; but more serious

is their belief

that the United States has

conspired with "politicians" at Leopoldville

to deny the provinces their due.

In the context of possible national elections

in 1964, developing anti-American sentiment

is ominous. Since the Belgians no longer are

scapegoats in any area, except possibly south-

Katanga, a radical national party-if it

emerged in

reaction to a moderate national

coalition under Adoula-could be expected to

build into its platform a plank of demagogic

anti-Americanism. Such a backlash could harm

an emerging moderate national coalition.

1. Pan-tribal in its official ideology, although in fact ethnic in its campaign in the Batetela-Bakusu-Bankutshu

zone in Maniema, Kivu, Sankuru, and Kasai; starting from this base, it began to penetrate rapidly into the

related Mongo areas in Equateur.

2. Some might argue that the Conakat belong in the marginal column. It is classified as pan-tribal because its

official ideology, if not its actual performance, is a claim to represent all the peoples of Katanga; it is in

any case not ethnic in the sense of representing any single tribe, although there is an important difference

between the Conakat, which is a federation linked at the level of the tribal association, and the PSA,

where membership is individual..

3. Puna claims to cover all of northern Equateur (now Moyen Congo). In the terms of its leader, Bolikango,

this is a reunification of the "grande ethnie bangala," but in fact it covers a number of different ethnic

groups, especially the Ngombe.

4. This overlooks the alliance with a smalles ethnic party, Association des Tsbokwe du Congo, de l'Angola,

et de la Rhodésie (ATCAR).

5. The MNC/K was not at first ethnic when the original MNC split into Lumumba and Kalonji wings in July

1959. However, it became increasingly a Kasai Baluba party, although some of its original intellectual

members, such as Iléo andAdoula, are not Baluba.

6. Listed as unitary despite its flirtation with federalism at the Kisantu Congress in December 1959.

7. Despite its initial link with the Conakat and early sympathy with some of the latter's views on the need

to ensure Katanga a larger share in the use of its own wealth.

8. MNC/K until early 1960 would have fallen into the radical category; as independence neared, the Kasai.

Baluba became increasingly preoccupied with the threat to their security in Luluabourg.
