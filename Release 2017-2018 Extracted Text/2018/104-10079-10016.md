BLAKEY Request, 12

Sept 77 (OLC #77-3890) confirms oral request

for all the Agency's files on. .Loran Eugene Hall.

This request

was made orally to you on fk Tuesday, August 30, and Mr. Holmes

made available what he stated were all the Agency's files on

Mr. HALL on Thursday, September 1.

3. BLAKEY Letter, 28 Sept 77

re discrepancy on what Holmes provided

..."at that time, the two staff members were provided with one

CIA-generated document on Loren Eugene Hall that had not been

located

previously....

4. Holmes Memo, 29 Sept 77

The Agency's file on Hall contained one Agency document-

HAVA 2037 (IN 46987), 21 April 1959. Other documents included

in Hall's file were

9 FBI reports and 1 Army Report......

5.

OLC 77-4405/a, 5 Oct 77 (George L. Cary to Blakey)

ref: Blakey letter of October 3, 1977 asking to be informed as to ni

whether any relationship existed between Mr. Loran HALL and the CIA.

A diligent search of our files fails to disclose any record of any

relationship whatsoever between the CIA and Mr. Hall either as an

employee or an independent contractor.

...fails to disclose any record of any secrecy agreement....so

far as this Agency is concerned we see no reason at this time

Mr. Hall sbould not feel free to fully respond to any inquiry from

the HSCA.

3. Holmes Memo. For The Record, 29 Sept 77, re Meeting w/HSCA reps.

I indicated the Agency has some information on this man,

almost all contained in FBI reports which I was in the process

of identifying. I explained that although we might have a 201

file on a

given person, information might appear in other files

which had not been incorporated into the person's 201. It was

therefore necessary

to call these documents in order to identify

them properly.

ODIO, Silvia

MEMO FOR THE RECORD (6 Sept 77, Russ Holmes)

re meeting with HSCA reps 1 September.

"The following topics, given... response and comments follow each topic.

"Agency's file on Loran Hall

Blakey had called the Agency on 30 August 77 asking to see the

agency's information on Loran Hall.

Comment:

According to testimony given before the Warren Commission

by Silvia ODIO of Dallas, Texas, three men, identifying

themselves as

Leopoldo, Angelo, and Leon Oswald, came to

her apartment on 26 Sept 63.

Leopoldo claimed

he and Angelo were members of JURE (Cuban Revolutionary

Junta) and wanted Silvia to meet "Leon Oswald"

• They introduced him as

an American who was

very much interested in the Cuban cause.

Next day,

Leopoldo called Silvia and said (still according to Silvia)

...our idea

is to introduce him (Oswald) to the underground in Cuba, because he

great, he is kind of nuts.'

is

In response to a request dated 28 August 1964 from J. Lee Rankin,

General Counsel of the President's Commission, the FBI initiated

investigation to identify the two men who accompanied "Leon Oswald" to

Silvia's apartment.

On 21 September 1964, the FBI informed Rankin that

the Bureau had identified the men as Loran Eugene Hall and Lawrence Howar

"Leon Oswald" was identified as William Seymour.

Response: The Agency has little information on Hall beyond what is

already available in overt material.........
