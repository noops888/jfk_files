CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROCRAM

• 1.

Reference is made to the attachment which is a

copy of a memorandum contained in Subject file dated •

7 November 1960 from Chief/Contact Division/00 to Chief/

Personnel Security Division/Office of Security. captioned

"JerTy P. HENNING, JI., EX-US Marine who served in Cuban

Army and Air Force 00-A-3170536!'

• a copy of which was

sent to WH Division and CI Staff. It is apparent that

the

HENNING referred to therein is identical with Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

•2. Of pertinence for the purposes of instant memo-

randum is that information contained in paragraphs four

and five of the reference and related by HEMMING voluntarily

to the Contact

Division/Los Angeles Office between 11 and

21 October 1960, to wit:

"Henning returned to California in October

1958... He left for Cuba by air via Miami on

...or about 18 February 1959 arriving in Havana

on 19 February 1959."

"He claimed to have contacted officials

in

the Cuban Consul's office in Los Angeles

prior to his departure."

3.

In substance relative to the

above, the HEMMING

file reflects that he served in the U. S. Marine Corps from

19 April 1954 to 17 October 1958: (The 201 file concerning

HEMMING reflects that he served in Japan with a U. S. Marine

Air Wing.) He then returned to the Los Angeles arca

for

discharge and then left for Cuba circa 18 February 1959 and

joined Castro's forces.
