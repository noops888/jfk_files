MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security ‘Analysis Group
FROM. : 1. Jerry 6. Brown
SUBJECT .

HEMMING, Gerald Patrick
088429 29" APPROVED Seer
CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PARERAY

1. Reference is made to the attachment which is‘a
copy of a memorandum contained in.Subject file dated-.
7 November 1960 from Chief/Contact Division/00 to Chief/
Personnel Security Division/Office of Security.captioned
"Jerry P. HENNING, Jr., Ex-US Marine who served in Cuban
Army and. Air Force 00-A-3170536", a copy of.which was
sent to WH Division and CI Staff. It is apparent that
the HENNING referred to therein is identical with Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

2. O£ pertinence for the pUrposes of instant memo-
randum is that information contained in paragraphs four
and five of the reference and related by HEMMING voluntarily
to the Contact Division/Los Angeles Office between 11 and
21 October 1960, to wit: i

: “Henning returned to California in October
1958....He left for Cuba by air via Miami on

--or about 18. February 1959 arriving in Havana
on 19 February 1959."

: "He claimed to have contacted officials
in the Cuban Consul's office in Los Angeles
prior to his departure."

3. In substance relative to the above, the HEMMING
file reflects that he served in the U; S; Marine Corps from
19 April 1954 to 17 October 1958. (The 201 file concerning
HEMMING reflects that he served in Japan with a U. S. Marine
Air Wing.) He then returned to the Los Angeles areca for
discharge and then left for Cuba circa 18 February-1959 and
joined Castro's forces. :

ee a CL BY 007472
SALE.



.4. The pertinence of the foregoing is that Lee Harvey
OSWALD served with a U. S. Marine Air Wing in Japan, and
whén OSWALD returned to the United States, he was assigned
to Santa Anna, California (Los Angeles area). Extensive
testimony contained in the Warren Commission hearings by
OSWALD's fellow Marines at Santa Anna contain the theme
that, OSWALD was interested in going to Cuba to join Castro
{upon his discharge) in early 1959 and that in early 1959
OSWALD allegedly made some contact. with.the ‘Cuban Consul’s
Office in Los Angeles.

5. The above as well as the Office of Security file
concerning HEMMING which is replete with information :
ossibly. linking HEMMING and his cohorts to OSWALD was

Prought to the attention of Mr. John Leader. (and Mr. “Scott

BrecHinridge), Inspector General, on 6 April 1977. Mr, Leader

advised he would pursue the matter.
