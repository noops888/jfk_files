Subject:

Overview Paper on Castro-Communist

Subversion

1. At a recent neeting the members of the sub-Committee

on Cuban Subversion discussed the critical need for an

overview of the Castro: Communist subversion situation

in Latin America, in 1ight of the many actions which have

been proposed or adopted in recent months.

It was

envisioned that such a presentation would

be designed on

o country by country basie, giving rectual evidence of

chenge in the situation in each country, and expressed

1n terms

of the

toples upon which we have recently

developed etudies.

2. The analysis should be developed from information

largely available in Washington, as opposed

to requiring

speclel reports fron the field;

and should be propared as

of 1 June, to be avallable not later than 1 July.

3. The Committee authorized me to recommend to you

that preparation of a paper of the scope outlined above

be required.

PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING APRIL IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1. The Department of State has:

a. Participated in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the 3-4 April Managua meeting respecting discouragement of

travel of Latin Americans to Cuba for training in subversion.

The text of the

resolution is appended hereto.

b. Headed an interdepartmental team currently visiting

the Isthmian capitals with the objective of securing, where

feasible, the fullest and quickest implementation of all the

recommendations agreed on at Managua. Prior to the depar-

ture of the team,

Department of State posts were instructed

to inform the host governments of the trip and to encourage

them to identify

the kinds and extent of technical assistance

it would be most

useful for the United States to furnish.

c. Caused to be noted in U.S. passports since 1 April that

they are not valid for travel to cuba.

d. Following an indication that the Bolivian Government

might be willing to increase efforts to impede travel of its

nationals to Cuba, instructed the U.S. Embassy to recommend

that the GOB:

(1) Ban travel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except

for official or special purposes approved by the GOB, and

establish legal penalties for violations;

(2) Require Bolivian citizens to have a passport or

other GOB document to travel abroad;

(3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba

unless

specially endorsed;

(4) Seek arrangements with third countries which are

important transit points under which third countries

will assist the GOB in preventing unauthorized travel

by Bolivians and will help identify violators.

-. Drawing on the recommendation in the paper on "The Move-

ment of Subversives and Subversive Irainees

and other sources,

prepared telegrams to the non-Isthmian posts, instructing them

to encourage host governments to take additional counter-

subversion steps. Each instruction was tailored to the local

situation in the recipient country and included appropriate

suggestions as to strategy which might be used in securing

implementation of the desired actions.

f. Requested posts in Latin America to encourage host

governments to take appropriate measures to discourage

participation of their nationals in Cuba's May Day cele-

bration, and to prevent charter flights from their country

to Cuba

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued the U.S, sea and air surveillance of the

area

surrounding Cuba until 25 April 1963, at the same rate

and with the same emphasis as existed prior to that date.

Since 25 April 1963, additional sea surveillance has been

realized between cuba and haiti, due to the stationing of

the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at the entrance of

the Gulf of Gonaives occasioned by the deterioration of

internal conditions within Haiti: Reports of subversive

movement, or suspected subversive movement, obtained by

U,S. surveillance are available for immediate transmittal

through the U,S. military alerting system.

6. Flowing from recommendations by the committee,

greatly accelerated current programs for the installation

of military communications facilities in Latin America.

As of 1 April, a commercial submarine cable from Florida

to Panama became operational.

This cable gives reliable

voice and teletype communications to CINCARIB including

both classified

teletype and voice. Negotiations are con-

tinuing in Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador for the instal-

lation of military radio facilities. Installation of a

multi-channel radio station has been completed in Costa

A similar facility in Nicaragua is scheduled for

completion by 1 July 1903.

c. Established an Intelligence Center at CARIBCOM

Headquarters,

in connection with the program of

surface

surveillance.of the Caribbean, for rapid processing and

dissemination to countries concerned, via

the American Am-

bassadors, of intelligence on the movement of subversives.

d. Established on 11 April a U.S. military alerting

system operated by CINCARIB and CINCLANT.

Pursuant to the

request of the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on

Cuban Affairs the Department of Defense has suspended the

use of the Military Groups in the alerting system and is

working with CIA to reduce duplication of

communications in Latin America by the installation of the

remaining two commercial leased circuits into Guatemala

City and Managua, and the stationing on a permanent basis

of temporary duty personnel. In November 1962; CIA's active

radio facilities in Latin American capitals were augmentec

with on-line cryptographic facilities and temporary personnel

to handle the bulk of all U.S. government communications ir

the area.

These facilities, know as Joint Communications

Centers, are now being operated by CIA on a 24-hour basis,

as a service to all U.S. government agencies. Latin American

traffic handled

by the CIA base radio station near washington

has increased from 3,000, 000 groups handled in October 1962

to 15,000,000 groups handled in March 1963,

of persons, arms and propaganda materials to and from Cuba.

1) Argentina - Station; in conjunction with the

Embassy, has continued to press the Argentine govern-

ment. to enact effective travel control legislation and

to adopt measures recommended by the Special Consultative

Committee on Security of the OAS. Information on Argentines

travelling to Cuba is being furnished to the Argentine

government by the station.

Several potential travellers

to cuba have been spotted

and are being assessed by the

station.

Information from three recent returnees from

Cuba is

being obtained through debriefings.

Station re-

ports that because of increased Mexican controls alt

truly clandestine travel to Cuba from Argentina is now via

Prague.

Che Guevara's mother was arrested on 23 April

upon her return to Argentina for importing Castro propa-

ganda.

2) Bolivia - Station and Embassy have been urging

Bolivian government to adopt stricter travel controls,

without apparent results so far. Names of travellers

known to have returned from Cuba are being furnished to

the Bolivian government.

Thus far, no action is known

to have been taken by the Bolivian

government on the

strength of such information.

Station comments that prob

lem with Bolivia is not in lack of information available

to government on Cuban subversion, but in getting Bolivia

to do something about it.
