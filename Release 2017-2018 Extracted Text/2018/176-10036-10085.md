ITS. HIGH-SACRIFICE SPIRIT AND ITS HATE-AMERICA IDEALS, WILL GET 90 PERCENT SUPPORT

FROM THE PEOPLE. ON THE MILITARY SIDE THE US HAS USED ULTRA-MODERN MECHANIZED i d

WEAPONS TO DESTROY ARMED UNTTS BY TACTICS OF AREA PACIFICATIÓN. THUS HARRASSED,

THE VC ARE NEVER SECURE: THEIR POLICIES MUST NOW AIM AI THE INTERVAI SITUATION AND

AT UPHOLDING THE HARDSHIP-BEARING SPIRIT. MEANWETLE, VC ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATIONS

DO NOT YET EXIST, BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT OF

THE PARTY.

ECONOMICALLY, VC AGRARIAN REFORMS HAVE SOLVED THE LAND PROBLEM FOR THE

PEASANTS AND NOW CONSTITUTE THE FOOD SOURCE FOR THE TROOPS AND CADRES. (SOURCE,

COMMENT. VC AGRARIAN REFORMS" REFER TO THE DE FACTO LAND EXPROPRIATIONS CONDUCITI

BY THE VIET. MINE DURING THE 1945-54 WAR. FOREST AND SEA RESOURCES ARE STILI

SECONDARY AND BRING IN ONLY SOME SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF TAXES.. THE VC ARE MEETING

GREAT DIFFICULTIES AT THE PRESENT TIME, BUT THE SVN PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED BY

INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AND INTERNAL MILITARY MEASURES, I.E. STRONG ATTACKS. (SOURCE

COMMENT. THE SOLUTION THROUGE "INTURNATIONAL POLITICS" REFERS TO THE BELIEF THAT,

IF THE VC CAN MAINTAIN THE PRESENT RELATIVE STALEMATE LONG ENOUGH, THE US WILL TIRE

OF THE STRÜGGLE AND SEEK SOME KIND OF NEUTRALIST SOLUTION.)
