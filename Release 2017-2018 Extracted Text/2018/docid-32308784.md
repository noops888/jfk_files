contact with REISS for a number of years.

He was born in Hamburg, Germany

in 1916 and he came to Cuba as a refugee in larch, I942: He has been used

as a contact on miscellaneous matters by this office since 1948. Recently

we have been endeavoring to encourage REISS to make a connection with the

Partido Socialista Popular (Communist Party of Cuba) because it is believed

that he has the appearance, background, and intelligence to function well

in such a capacity.

He has been making very limited progress to date and

it is believed he may be afraid of the consequences if he does make an

entry into the PSP and then gets caught. We plan to continue our efforts

to develop REISS and manwhile he will be utilized on general contact

problems and on translation matters where deemed advisable.

He is of
