avéllingness to join the party to obtain intelligence information and he
displays enough enthusiasm and imagination to show that he might actually
work his way into the confidence of the Communists. He is personally -
acquainted with several alleged party members and he plens to put himself
in such a position that it would be logical for them to invite him to join ®
in their PSP activity. His progress will be closely followed by this office
and precautions will be taken to assure that he is not a PSP plante 0377)

sopypffiss is @ Potential Security Informant. We have been in
contact with REISS for a number of years, He was born in Hamburg, Germany
in 1916 and he came to Cuba as a refugee in March; 1972: “He has been used
as @ contact on miscellaneous matters by this office since 1948. Recently
we have been endeavoring to encourage REISS to make a connection with the
Partido Socialista Popular (Communist Party of Cuba) because it is believed
that he has the appearance, background, and intelligence to function well
in such @ capacity. He has been making very limited progress to date and
it is believed he may be afraid of the consequences if he does make an
entry into the PSP and then gets caught. We plan to continue our efforts
to develop REISS and meanwhile he will be utilized on general contact
Problems and on translation matters where deemed advisable. He is of
value tous as a linguist because of his knowledge of Spanish, German and
Jewish dialects. W .
