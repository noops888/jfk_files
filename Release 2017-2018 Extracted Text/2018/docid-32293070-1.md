Re New York airtel 6/30/61 enclosing letterhead memorandum

regarding Delesseps Morrison.

New York should maintain close contact with PCI Harry H.

Hansen for further developments involving Morrison and Albert Emke in

International Time, Inc., and possible involvement with this organization

by Carlos Marcello. You should also attempt to further identify (FNU) Diaz,

a Venezuelan national, des cribed in your airtel. Particular emphasis

should be placed on whether or not the underworld is investing money in

this organization.

New York should further identify Emke through Hansen for

the benefit of New Orleans and the Bureau to determine if he is identical

with Albert Joseph Emke, former president of the Hibernia Homestead

and Savings Association (HHSA), New Orleans, Louisiana. Emke of the

BHSA of New Orleans has been the subject of a Federal Reserve Act case

by the Bureau, and according to latest correspondence from New Orleans

in this case, trial of Emke and associates for embezzlement of funds'

from the KHSA is scheduled for July 18, 1961, at New Orleans.

New Orleans should insure that the Bureau is appropriately

informed of any further developments concerning International Time, Inc.,

and possible involvement in this organization by Carlos Marcello.
