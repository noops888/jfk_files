1, One day in 1963, Source met in Havana "Moro" MANIFF, an old
friend since 1955, and complained that he was tired of his job
with the Ministry of Exterior Commerce and wanted to make a.
change, MANIFF said he would do something about it. Two or
three days later, another frierd, Ramon VASQUEZ Montenegro,
whom Source had knowa at the Ministry of Industry, came to see
Source, saying that MANIFF bad gentioned that Source was having
trouble with the militia and wanted to change jobs. VASQUEZ
promised to telephone the following day and did so, arranging
to pick up Source in a car, They drove around through Vedado *
together while VASQUEZ offered Source a job in espionage and
counter-intelligence, Source asked for a little time to think
over the situation, Tne following day VASQUEZ telephoned Source
and the day after that VASQUEZ called on Source personally to
urge hin to accept; Source decided he had better do so and agreed,
Thereupon Saul GONZALEZ brought Source a personal-hastory state+
ment form of three or four sheets, which Source filled out. The
form included full name, date and place of birth, physical
description, -data on relatives (parents, brothers, and sisters),
and addresses at which hé had lived for the preceding ten years,
GONZALEZ told Source to have no more worries atout his’ troubles
with the militia. Three or four days later Source went to the
Ministry of Interior for firgerprinting. He was told to go to
a doctor for a physical examiration but never did so, and ap-
Parently no one checked up on him. Three or four days later,
GONZALEZ picked Source up and drove him directly to tne Head-
quarters of the Direccion Genzral de Inteligencia (General
Directorate of Intelligence - DuZ). at the DGI Neadquarters
Source saw several old acquaintances, including Fernardo PASCUAL
Perez, Ramon Cesar CUENCA Montoto, and others.

- a CSCI-316/02303-65

As soon as Source was taken tu the DGI Headquarters, Source vas
told to choose a pseudonya., After Source chose the pseudonym
"Victor FERNANDE: Norberto HERNANDEZ Curbelo, who was thea in
charge of the Departamento de Liberscicn Nasional (Nationa? -
Liberation Department.- LN) operations for Central America under
the NA Section, sent a memorandum to the DGI Personnel Depart
went giving the psdudonym as belonging to Source. The actual
forwarding memorandum was sent by the Secret Office. ‘This vas an
essential step because payrolls were always made out in pseudonym.
The normal pseudonym consists of a given name and a surname, and
can be used by the given name, surname, or both together. Since
each officer chooses his own pscudunym, there is. sometimes dupli-
cation, with two persons’ choosing the same name. When this
happens nothing is done if the two persons sre working in different
departments-of the DGI. If for any reason there is a shift in
personne] hich brings the two persons with the same pseudonyns,
first or qast names, into the same department, one-cr the other
wa have to change his pseudonym ia order to avoid confusion.

Immediately upon Joiiiing the DGI, Source was assigned to the
Salvador DeSk “in tho Seccion Central (Central American Section)
of the LN Department, where he continued to work. He was started
at once on reading the desk operational files and very soon was
given operational files from other aesxs to also read. He re-
ceived only minimal security briefings and was told to invent for
Nimself some sort of reasonable corer job. Source kept his old
Ministry of Internal Trade identification card to use as cover,
As soon as employment was mentioned to him he was told that he
was being recruited by "HM" and that it was for espionage.
