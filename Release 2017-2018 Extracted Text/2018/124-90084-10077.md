THE SIX CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. LAUREANO BAT IS TA, THE

IFEDEC REPRESENTATIVE AT THE SEMINAR, REQUESTED THAT REPRESENTA-

TIVES FROM EACH OF THE COUNTRIES PREPARE WRITTEN REPLIES TO THE

QUESTIONNAIRE.

2:

COSTA RICAN AND NICARAGUAN REPRESENTATIVES, PARTICULARLY

JORGE XMON GE OF COSTA RICA, REACTED IN AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE

AND SUSPICIOUS FASHION TO THE IFEDEC QUESTIONNAIRE AND REFUSED TO

PROVIDE WRITTEN ANSWERS. OTHER REPRESENTATIVES HAD LITTLE DESIRE

TO PROVIDE WRITTEN ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE BUT GENERALLY DID

NOT REACT AS STRONGLY AS DID THE COSTA RICANS AND NICARAGUANS. THOSE

MOST OPPOSED TO BATISTA'S REQUEST EXPRESSED THE VIEW. THAT THE:

QUESTIONNAIRE WAS AN IFEDEC PLOY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION: CONCERNING

THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA: AND THEY DUBBED THE QUESTIONNAIRE

EFFORT "OPERATION CAMELOT,"

BATISTA EXPLAINED THAT THE INFORMATION

REQUESTED WAS REQUIRED BY THE

ATIN AMERICAN CENTER FOR INFORMATION

(CIDAL), AN ORCANIZATIOY RECENTLY FOUNDED IN CARACAS SY THE AMERICAN

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION VEI

(ODCA) AND HEADED BY BATISTA.

THE SALVADORAN REPRESENTATIVES AT THE SEMINAR, AT LEAST, HAD NEVER
