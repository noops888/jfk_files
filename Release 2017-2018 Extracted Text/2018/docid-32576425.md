PHILADELPHIA DIVISION

AR; CONSPIRACY

The following is technical information for review by the sound-

trained agent assigned to your division.

Reference is made to your airtel of 1/27/65 which transmitted

a drawing Number S97 showing details of the telephone cable service

at parochial institutions 712 through 730 Montrose Street, Philadelphia,

Pennsylvania. These technical diagrams have been reviewed in detail

and it has been determined from this review that the proposed receiving

site is beyond the operating range of the Radio Frequency Microphone-

Telephone (RFMT) unit. Accordingly, this technique does not appear

from a technical standpoint to be feasible in this instance.

Another possible approach under technical consideration in this

situation would require a 48-volt quiet or talking battery being supplied

to the target telephone line at all times. In addition, if this approach

proved to be feasible, it would be necessary to substitute an altered

telephone instrument in the target area.

Before proceeding further with this possible different technical

approach, please determine, if possible, whether the local telephone

operating company cowd provide the required battery to the target

instrument line and it would be possible; in your judgment, to sub-

stitute an altered telephone instrument in the target area under

consideration. In addition, a spare pair of wires should be available

from the pole in the rear of 902 South 8th Street to your consolidated

monitoring point. An alternate location for receiving equipment will

be in the close proximity to the terminal at 801 Washington. If the

alternate location is selected, then it will be necessary to have a spare

pair of wires from that point back to the monitoring location.
