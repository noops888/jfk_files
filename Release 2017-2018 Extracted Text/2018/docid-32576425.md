AR; CONSPIRACY

The following is technical information fer review by the sound-
trained agent assigned to your division.

: Reference is made to your aiztel of 1/27/65 which transmitted

a drawing Number 597 showing details of the telephone cable service
at parochial institutions 712 through 730 Montrose Street, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. These technical diagrams have been reviewed in detail
and it has been determined from this review that the proposed receiving
site is. beyond the operating range. of the Radio Frequency Microphone-

. Telephone (RFMT) unit. Accordingly, this ‘technique does not appear
from a technical standpoint to be feasible in this instance.

Another possible approach ander technical consideration in this
situation would require a 48-volt quiet or talking battery being supplied
to the target telephone line at all times..-In addition, if.this approach
proved to be feasible, it would.be necessary to subalitute an altered
— instrument in the target.area..

“Before proceeding further with: this possible different technical
approach, please.determine, if possible, whether the local telephone
operating company could provide the required: ‘battery to the target -
instrument liné and if it would be ‘possible; in your judgment, to. sub-
stitute.an altered telephone instrument in the target area under
consideration... In addition, a spare pair of wires should be available
from the pole in the rear of 902 South 8th Street to your consolidated
monitoring point. .An alternate location for receiving equipment will
be. in the close, proximity to the terminal at 801 Washington... If the
alternate location is selected, then it will be neceasary to have a spare

——_ —— pair of wires from that point back to the monitoring location.
