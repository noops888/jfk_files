RE: “MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL DE RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA
(MIRR)

On June 20, 1964, MM T-2 advised that on that date
the wife of Laredo Rodriguez had made a statement denying
that the missing aircraft was involved.in activities of the
MIRR.

On June 22, 1964, MM T-2 advised that Laredo
Rodriguez, Treasurer of the MIRR, had stated that. the air
raid in-which Luis Diaz Lopez participated over Cuba on
June 19, 1964, was sponsored by the MIRR.

Rodriguez said that contrary to reports circulated
by Cuban Government sources, there were no survivors from
the crash of this aircraft. Rodriguez claimed he had con-

firmed this through his sources inside Cuba.

MM T-2 continued that on June 22, 1964, a Cuban
pilot whose name is unknown to MM T-2 had stated he and —
another Cuban pilot whose name was not disclosed to MM T-2
had during the recent past been making practice runs in a
Cessna aircraft in the Bahama Islands preparatory to parti-
cipation in an air raid in Cuba with Luis Diaz Lopez. MM T-2
advised that the individual whom he was in contact with is
a white male,about 24 years of age,with approximately 70 hours
of flying experience. This individual said the raid was
originally scheduled for Sunday, June 21, 1964, but that for
some unknown reason, pressure was brought to bear to carry
out the raid on June 19, 1964. This individual told MM T-2
that he and a pilot companion were unable to go, therefore,
were replaced by other crew members.

On June 23, 1964, MM T-1 furnished the following
information:

JOHNSON has advised this office that ORLANDO BOSCH
desires him to select’a plane and a pilot for the raid
mentioned in this letterhead memorandum which BOSCH is
secretly planning. JOHNSON has agreed to do so but states
he has no intention of actually participating in this raid
himself or selecting a plane and pilot. He agreed to keep
the Miami Office advised of pertinent developments with
regard to activities of Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH. It has been
noted, however, that BOSCH while utilizing JOHNSON on
occasions, has at crucial times dispensed with his services,
as he appeared to do in the plans concerning the ill-fated
