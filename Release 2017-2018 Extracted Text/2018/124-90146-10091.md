Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) from the time of its organization
in the spring of 1960 until his departure for Algeria in the fall of
1962. The FPCC has been supported by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and Gibson has busied himself as well with other front groups in the
United States supported by the SWP. (The Socialist Workers Party has
peen designated by the Attorney General of the United States pursuant i
to Executive Order 10450.) -

‘because of inadequate pay and operating funds, by the spring of
1962 when he stated that he intended to leave the organization in
the fall. Gibson left Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in September 1962
for Algeria where he planned to work as a journalist for several
South American and European newspapers (none identified) and to \
travel to Morocco, Ghana, Guinea and Mali before returning to the zl
