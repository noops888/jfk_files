foreign nission concerned in Havana.

In Source's case appli-

cation sas first' made in March 196 for a Chilean visa and

for a, dexican visa, even though no trave. to Chile was

contemplated.

The reason for this was awareness by Cuban

of desican suspicior of Cuban diplomatic personnel.

The Cuban authorities believed the lexican Embassy in Havana

Forgery and Falsificaiion Capabilities

16.

The IS has no capabilitirs for making false passports or iu-

ternal incuments from any country

cecause of the difficulty

of matching the paper and the

technical problems involved in

the engraving and printing process.

It also lacis capability

for eradicating entries

in passports because of the problem

involved in attempting to delete entries without defacing the

doruments.

17.. Filsification and forgery is limited to filling in valid blank

foreign passports, making photograph and page substitutions in

sona-fide foreign passports, and placing false travel entries

in foreign passports.

Travel entries from western Europe and

Latin Amerfca can be forged.

Cuba and when he arrired in Prague, but showing his mode of

travel to be such that he never passed through either Cuba or

Czechoslovakia.

Should the agent's bona-fide passport bear

replaces the page bearing such entry with a blank page from a
