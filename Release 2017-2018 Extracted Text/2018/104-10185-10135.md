Use of Altered and Fraudulent Documents by Cuban Intelligence

1, Cubans and other Latin Americon nationals operating for the General’
Directorate of Intelligence (Direccion Genoral de Inteligencia ~
DGI) of the Cuban Ministry of Interior are issued Cuban passports
in alias by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, These passports are
sconsidered legal ip all respocts by Cuban authorities. Cuban’
agents also use valid passports of a numbor of Latin American

authorities, The documents used by non-Cubans operating under

IS auspices are inteaded to hide all traces of their travel into

and out of’ Cuba. ! :

Issuance of diplomatic passports in alias is an automatic
process whonéver an IS staff employee travels on assignment
abroad, The employee involved provides the following itens,
which he selects personally, to one "Felix Rafael," in the
DGI, who fdrwards the material to the Foreign Ministry:

ry Passports on

Cuban ordinary passports are issued in alias to IS agents, in-
cluding Cubans and ‘nationals of other Latin American countries, °
by the Cuban Foreign Ministry in much the same way as in the
caselof ‘diplomatic passports. In addition to the bearer's
photdgraph, an agent provides cover information on himself

for se “im the passport which conforms as closely as possible

to his réal life. As an example, Source cited his own case,
sayidg. that he furnished a cover story containing his true

datd of birth, but listing him as single, even though he is
maryvied, Typical octupations shown on ordinary passports

used by IS agents are “student” (estudiante) and "laborer",

(ourero) oo

the only distinguishing feature for differentiating between
a fuban ordinary passport issued in ‘alias to an IS.agent and
a fona-fide document is a special code for the serial number.
Source thinks that alias passports for IS agents bear five- |
aie it serial numbers while bona-fide passports bear six- i
aye serial numbers. Source's theory was based on the fact
t his ordinary passport issued in alias bore a five-digit
5 imber while the bona-fide passport issued to his wife bore _
.aljsix-digit number, This premise is in-direct contradiction

with a Study of the numbering system. found to be in use on~

with occasional discrepancies, in which a new set of acces-
on numbers is used each year, Thus, serial numbers will

numbers are generally in a five-drgit pattern, although. it
was neted that from June to Decexber 1962 they ascended to

six-digit numbers. q

Source’s ordinary passport isszed in alias was allegedly ob-
tained in January 1964, but was given an issuance date of 23
August 1963 and bears a serial nazber consistent with the
accession pattern for the latter issuance date, Likewise,
five other Cuban ordinary passports issued in 1963 in alias
for use by agents under Source’s supervision dear serial
numbers adhering to the accession pattern corresponding to°
their particular dates of issue.

ordinary passports.

ide Visas, Vaccination Certificates, and Passages

Diplomatic visas for use in Cubaa diplomatic passports in alias
are applied for directiy—by-the Cuban Foreign Ministry to the’
foreign nission concerned in Havana. In Source'’s case appli-
cation was first' made in March 1964 fcr a Chilean visa ‘and
later for a, Mexican visa, even though no travel to Chile was
contempiated., The reason for this vas awareness by Cuban
authorities of Mexican suspicion of Cuban diplomatic personnel.
The Cuban authorities believed the Mexican Embassy in Havana
would be less suspicious of a passport containing a visa from
another Latin American country.

‘Passage bookings and international vaccination certificates

for use by staff employees and agents using Cuban alias pass-
ports are also obtained, through the Cuban Foreign Ministry.
Vaccination certificates are obtained from the Instituto
Cubano de Amistad con los Pueblos (ICAP). IS persornel's
passages are always booked on Cubana Airlines because’ such
fares are payable. in Cuban pesos. No passages are booked on
Soviet or Czech airlines because these require payment in
U.S. dollars, which are scarce for the Cuban Government.

After a Cuban diplomatic passport has been used for one round

trip, an exit permit from the Cuban Foreign Ministry, known
as "Visto Bueno,” is required for each subsequent departure
from Cuba. The Foreign Ministry issues these to personnel
using alias passports in the same way as they would-for bona-
fide documents,

Foreign visas in ordinary passports issued in alias to IS
agents are applied for directly by the agents to the foreign
missions concerned in Havana.

of Foreign Passports Used by IS Agents

15.

The Cuban IS makes use of valid passports from a number of
countries, including Mexico, all Central American countries,
Argentina, British Guiana, Colombia, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Haiti, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela, for document-
ing its agents. The IS hed no access to, nor need for, pass-
ports from Spain and the United States. Source specified
that the IS does not use Uruguayan passports because the
Cuban Gevernnent does pot wish to endanger its good relations
with that country, Valid filled-in and blank passports from

the various countries are obtained by the IS through the local
Communist Part in the countries concerned,

Lon Capabilities

The IS has no capabilities tor making false passports or in-
ternal Gecume.ts trom any country vecause of the difficulty +
of matching the paper and the technical problems involved in
the engraving and printing process. It also lacks capability
for erasicating entries in passports because of the problem
involvéd in attempting to delete entries without defacing the

documents. ‘

F, sification and forgery is limited to filling in valid blank
foreign passports, making photograph and page substitutions in
sona-fide forergn passports, and placing false travel entries

“in foreign passports. Travel entries from western Europe and

Latin America can“bé forged. Source did not know whether the
IS itself made the- photograph and page substitutions and for-
geries. All documentS requiring forgeries and substitutions
were turned over to One ‘Alionso,” in the IS, who took them to

a site unknown to Source, Source theorized that the forgeries
and substitutions may have been done by the Departamento de -

_ Seguridad del Estado (Department of Statg Security - DSE), the

cuunteriatelligence arm of the Cuban Government, which he said
has much wore personnel than the DGI.

Prospective agents recruited by the IS in other Latin American
countries and brought to Cuba for training in methods of sabo-
tage and other subversive activities are provided with detached
visas and spurious passports to conceal the fact that they ever
entered Cuba.

In order that no Cuban visa will appear in an agent Lrainee's
bona-fide passport on his way to Cuba, the Cuban mission in a
Latin American country issues the Cuban visa on a separate
Sheet of paper. In 1963 most agent trainees were being brought
into Cuba through Mexico, where the Cuban Embassy issued the
separate visas, Early in 1963 Mexican immigration officers
began using a rubber stamp bearing the notice "Salid para

Cuba” (Departed for Cuba), with the date on tt, which they
automatically stamped in all passports of travelers proceeding
to Cuba. To counter this move the IS began replacing, wherever
possible, the pages of the passports bearing this entry with
blank pages from valid passports from the same country as that
of the traveler. Source also believes that in 1964 the travel
pattern of a few prospective agents proceeding to Cuba may have
been modified, thus decreasing slightly the number entering

through Mexico.

To conceal the agents travel when leaving Cuba, he 1s provided
for the first leg cf the journey with a Cuban ordinary passport
in alias, The route of travel is from Havana to Prague. Czech
authorities collect these passports upon landing in Prague.
Source does not know what disposition is made of the Cuban
passports by the Czechs, but he asserts that they are never
returned to the agent.

For the second leg of the journey, carrying the agent from
Prague via western Ezrcre back to his native land, he is pro-
vided in Havana, before departure, with a passport from another
Latin American country. The non-Cuban passport may be the
agent's bona-fide doccment which has been returned to him or
it may be another valic Latin American passport pressed into
service for the purpose. If the agent's own passport bears
no evidence of travel into Cuba it will be used for this pur-
pose, being “brought <p tc date” with forged western European
entries to explain the gap between the time when he left for
Cuba and when he arrived in Prague, but showing his mode of
travel to be such that he never passed threugh either Cuba or
Czechoslovakia. Should the agent‘’s bona-fide passport bear
the Mexican cachet showing that he proceeded to Cuba, the IS
replaces the page bearing such entry with a blank page from a
valid passport of the same country if feasible. If page sube
stitution is not possitle, either because no other -passport
from the same country is available or because substitution
proves too difficult, the IS will provide the agent with
another passport, from his own country if availabie, or from
nother Latin American country, The substitute passport may
‘be a filled-in original, in which case a photograph substitu-
tion will be made, and the agent will travel under the identity
of the original bearer.

In other cases, where valid blank passports are used, the agent
may even travel under his trué identity after "surfacing" on

the second leg of the journey, in westerr Europe, provided the
passport used is from his own country, In such a case informa-
tion from his bona-fice passport will be copied directly in

the blank passport. If the passport is fron a country differing
from that of the ageat, his identity will be changed. As in
the case of travel uncer the agent's bona-fide passport, in

the case of spurious nen-Cuban passports, false travel entries
are made to account fer the agent's time spent in Cuba, placing
him in western Eurcpe, but not in Cuba nor Czechoslovakia,
during that period.

Quality and Availability of Spurious Documentation

23.

24.

Providing documentatioz for agent trainees is the responsibility
of the IS country desk officer handling trainees from the par-
ticular country, The country desk officers receive and main-
tain custody of passports coming from the Communist Parties in
their areas of jurisdiction. Although the agent's training in
Cuba may take several weeks, or even a few months, it often
takes a year or more fer the country desk officer to be able
to provide his trainees with the proper docunentation, Source
commented that invariaely a country desk officer will be short
one Spurious passport in his “collection” of passports for a
group of about six trainees. ‘Where possible the officer will
“borrow” a passport fren his cclleague from another country
desk.

On at least one occasica forged travel entries made in an
agent's passport were found to have a chronological error

shortly before the agent*s departure from Cub2, The error
consisted of a false exit cachet for a given port of encry
bearing a date precedi=s that furnished on-the false entry
cachet for the same port of entry, a physical impossibility
in true life. DeSpite the discovery of this error the IS
