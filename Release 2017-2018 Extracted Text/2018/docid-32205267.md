MEMORANDUM FOR THE ACTING SECRETARY

Subject, Cuban Sugar

From: I - Mr. Chayes

A night's reflection on the problem of the Cuban sugar

cargo now at San Juan has Intensifled my concern, rather

than abated it.

I think the following points should be

brought to the attention of the President:

I..

The potential galn from the operation is negli

gible.

Evan if 1t results, as vr. Johnson suggested, 1n

spollage of $500,000 of sugar, this 18 perifberal in terms

of the bloo econonio capacity.

2.

The fact that the sugar has been treated will al-

most certainly be discovered, at the time of ultimate con-

sumption, if not before.

that time, chenical analysis

will be employed, and will, in all likellhood Identify

the method that was used.

Even if the matter cannot be

tied to any particular cargo, I thiar the USSR could and

would acouse the U.s. and with considerable plausibility

In world forums.

After all, the technology Involved 1s

quite complicated and 1s not likely to be available to

stevedores, crewmen and the like, unless made available to

then from outside.

The only alternative we could suggest

as the source of the action 1s the cuban resistance move

ment,

Even 1f we were able to make this suggestion stick,

the only result would be to discredit further the responsi

bility and bons fides of that movement.

3. I have no confidende in the scientific judgment

that the substance is harmless.

We know fyon recent ex

perience that drugs which have been extensively tested for

human consumption turn out to have side effeots when widely

I cannot belleve that this substanoe has had

such extenaive testing. The described effeots are such as

to suggest that the impact would not be unform accross a

wlde sample of the population.

A good way to put this 1asue

in perspective is to ask how you would feel about the same

thing happening to yourself of your family, 1f the sotion

had been taken by the other side.

â€¢ 4. It Is wrong to contaminate food supplles.

I would very much like to be present when this matter is dis

cussed with the President, unless you feel it would detract

from the presentation.
