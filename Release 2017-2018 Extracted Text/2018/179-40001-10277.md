MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr... ec Rankin

SUBJECT: Anonymous Telephone Calls to United States
Embi.asy in Canberra, Australia, Relative to
Plani.ed Aasassination of President Kennedy

1. I refer again to paragraph two of your memorandum,
dated 12 February 1964, relative to disseminations to the Secrot
Service made by CIA.

2. On 24 November 1963, CIA received from the Department
of the Navy a copy of a cable from the Naval Attache in Canberra,
Australia (IN 67327, Top Secret, lat ‘ vuded to Secret),
reporting a telephone conversation the previous day with an
anonyraous individual who had described himself as a Polish
chauffeur for the Soviet Embassy in that city. This individual,
while discussing several matters of intelligence interest, touched
on the possibility that the Sovict Governmen: had financed the
assassination of President Kermedy. Reference was made in this
cable to the receipt of a similar anonymous tclephone call on
15 October 1962.

3, Upon receipt of this cable irom Navy CIA took the
following action:

a. Cabled to Canberra asking full details of the
telephone conversation of 23 November and the call made
on 15-October 1962. It should be noted that CIA had not
previously known of the 1962 telephone call.

b. The CLA Station in Canberra, on 27 November, furnished
all available information on the 1962 telephone call. It appears
that source on that occasion stated that "Iron Curtain Countries"
planned to pay a hundred thousand dollars for the assassination
of President Kennedy.

¢. On 27 November, the CIA Canberra Station also furnished
_ complete detail on the anonymous-telephore call of 23 November 1963. ~ |

d. On 29 November, CIA. disseminated this information, as
supplied by its Canberra Station, to the White House, Department
~ of State, and Federal Bureau of Investigation, with a copy to the
Secret Service. A copy of this dissemination in its exact text
is. attached to this memorandum. |

4, The CIA Station in Canberra arranged for discussion of the
calls with the Australian security service. Inthe opinion of the —
Australian authorities, the caller was'a crank. In any event, they
were not able to identify any Polish employee of the Soviet Embassy,
the automobile described by the caller a6 the one he drove, or the
license plate number given by him. No further information on this
call has been received. Available evidence would tend to show that
the caller was some type of crank. This ee howsver, cannot
be Seated s :
