witting of the reason our interes and those who
assembled them for hin re not told for were intended.

We called back four officers for interview. Richard Bissell,
Sheffield Edwards from retix ian Harvey from sick leave,
and Nestor Senchez from his post in Caracas. Otherwise, our interviews
were confined to officers assigned to the headquarters installation.
We opened each interview by referring to the Drew Pearson column of
7 March 1967, citing that as the reason for our interest in learning
of plots to assassinate Castro. We told those interviewed that we
were on a fact-finding mission on behalf of the Director, and that
this was not the usual sort of Inspector General investigation. We
asked each to name any others who were likely to have knowledge of
such plots. We cautioned each not to discuss the subject of the
interview with anyone eise--even others whom we might interview.
