SOURCES OF INFCEMATION

Files were furnished for review by the Director of Security,

the Deputy Director for Support, the Caneral Counsel, the Legislative

Counsel, the Chief of My Division, an√† by Col. I. C. King, former

Chief of WH Division. Biographic files and intelligence publicaticas

were furnished by the Director of Central Reference. He was not rade

witting of the reason for our interest in then, and those who

assembled them

for him were not told for whon trey were intended.

We called back four Officers for interviews: Richard Bissell,

Sheffield Edwards fron retirement, Willian Harvey from sick leave,

and Nestor Senchez fron nis post in Caracas.

Ocherwise, our interviews

were confined to officers assigned to the headquerters installation.

We opened each interview by referring to the Drew Fearson column of

7 March 1967, citing that as the reason for our interest in learning

of plots to assassinate Castro. We told those interviewed that we

were on a fact-finding mission on behslf of the Director, and that

this was not the usual sort of Inspector General investigation. We

asked, each to name any others who were likely to have knowledge of

such plots.

We cautioned each not to discuss the subject of the

Interview with anyone else-even others whom we might interview.

This is a complete list of those Interviewed:
