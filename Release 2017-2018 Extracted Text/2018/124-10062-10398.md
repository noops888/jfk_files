DETAILS: Stu: VE

Herriman Smith, senior White House correspondent,
reported caevians alleges David William Ferrie was associated
with a group of anti-Castvo Cubans which trained at hal :
Pontchartrain, Louisiana, during the period 1981-1962. Lon
February 23, 1961, CEA confidentially informed this Bureau
that in connection with a sensitive CIA project directed
against Cuba, one phase of which invelved the training of
Cuban exiles, CIA would initiate a training operation at.

(Camp Belle Chase, located a short distance south of New Origans
and Lake Bunteharevadn< CXA advised that thie camp had_been

put would be reopened by CIA |
€IA further advised it woula be
training from 15 to 40 Cubans at e time for a period of about

five weeks. We, of course, did not investigate CIA's activities
at Camp Belle Chase, Lowisiana, andjour files contain no(S)
-- information that ES Willian Fervieing any connectionGuith

this CIA operation.

Yn duly, 1963, we received information from several
sources that. a number of Cuban refugees bad come ‘to New Orleans
from Miami, Florida, through the efforts of Rudolph Davis,
reportedly to attend a training camp after which they would be
sent to a training camp in Guatemala. Sourcés reported this
group became disenchanted and returned to Miami shortly after
their arrival. U

We interviewed Rudolph Davis in this matter and he
indicated he acted as a coordinator between the Movimiento
Democratics Cristiano (MDC), an anti-Castro organization, and
the New York City Police Department in 1961 and that he was the
delegate for this anti-Castyo organization in New Orleans. He
stated he came to New Orleans in August, 1961, and in early
1963 made friends with persons in the lumber business in
Guatemala with whom he formed the Guatemalan Lumber and Mineral
Corporation, Davis said he brought approximately 19 men to
New Orleans to train for lumbex cutting work in Guatemala. He
added that when the men learned they were to work in a lumber
industry and were not reeruited foy military operations against
Cuba, they became disenchanted and returned to Miami.
files contain no information indicating that David Willian
Ferrie or Lee Harvey. Oswald had any contact or connection with
Davis or the anti-Castro organigation which Davis represented. U
