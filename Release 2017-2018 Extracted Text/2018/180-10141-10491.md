VECIANA INSERT

In a review of its own files on March 15, 1978,

the CIA noted that Veciana had contacted the Agency

three times -- in December, 1960; July, 1962; and
April, 1966 -- for assistance in plots against
“ata bo ot

Castro. (Classified file 201-312966. bir. 198531,
3/15/78, 78 0421219) According to the CIA: “Officers
listened to Veciana, expressed no interest,
offered no encouragement and never recontacted him
on this matter. There has been no Agency relationship
with Veciana.» Fostole (abi)

The Committee's own review of the Agency's files
basically confirmed the stated conclusions about
the meetings with Veciana in 1960 and 1966. —Hewever;

however,

A review of files dated July 7, 1962Arevealed
that contact with Veciana had been made by an
asset, SKEWER-1, and that SKEWER-l had given

Veciana $500 for operational activity. (Classified
