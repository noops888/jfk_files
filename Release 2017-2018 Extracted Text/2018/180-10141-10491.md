On August 10, 1978, B.H. (Balmes Nives Hidalgo Jr.),

a former covert operative of the CIA,

was interviewed by the

(194)

Committee in a special closed

session.

B.H. was a CIA agent

(195)

from 1952 to 1970.

Between 1960 and

(196)

1964 he was assigned to Cuban operations.

As such, he testified, he was

involved in "day-to-day"

operations with David Atlee Phillips. He characterized

Phillips as "an excellent intelligence officer" and "a

(197)

personal friend." t

When

asked

if he knew an individual named Maurice

Bishop, B.H. said:

"Again, Mr. Bishop was in the organization but I had

! no personal day-to-day open relationship with him. Phillips,

(198)

yes; Bishop, no. I knew them both...

Although he couldn't describe Bishop's physical

characteristics, B.H. said he had

seen him "two or

times"

" i in the "hallways or cafeteria

2=7z at CIA headquarters in Langley. B.H. said he thought

Bishop worked in the Western Hemisphere Division

(202)

and that he had a position "higher than me."

He could not be more specific. The two or three times he

saw Bishop, he said, was between 1960 and 1964 when he himself

in Cuban operations, although, he said, he didn't know

(203)

if Bishop worked in that

area also. *E
