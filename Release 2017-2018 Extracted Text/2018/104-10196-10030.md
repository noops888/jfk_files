OSWALD in that ha went to inarry a Rusaien, later was photogruphed with the

with KOSTIKOV who turned OSWALD cver to his tors YATSKOY. Also, given the apparent Crankness
of Y's discussions with LIOVAL-1, particularly nis views Stalin and thrushehov, would appear
possible he told L-l truth re COMALD, at minimum re meeting OSNALD.
