MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group

SUBJECT:

Promotion of Mr. Calvin W. Hicks

1.. I would solicit Career Management Group. and the Promotion Panel

to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the cur

rent cycle of promotions from GS- 13 to GS-14.

2. After Mr. Hicks EOD in 1950, he advanced rapidly in three years

to GS-11.

He was promoted to GS-12 In 1956, six years later to. GS-13 in

1962, and since then has been almost 12 years In grade... He has had over-

seas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served as a training instructor, on

a PM task force, and with Miami Ops and area branches In Wil. In these

assignments he consistently recelved Strong ratings. Despite a largely para-

military background, in 1967 he adjusted to the intelligence production cycle

and developed the skills of an operations officer doing operations-oriented

reports work in the intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest

continuity in'the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful

Individual who exercises excellent professional judgment. He was recom

mended for promotion from GS-13 to GS-14 in April 1968 and in April 1969.

In 1970 he was recommended for a QSI by Fl Chief, Peer deSilva. He was.

again recommended for promotion in March 1971, In November 1972, and In

November 1973.

3.

Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela-

tive and

must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of

his career would seem to argue the equity of granting the often recommended

promotion to Mr.. Calvin Hicks as he nears the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is

49 years old and has a, family of five children. He has a medical hold which

will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem-

plates rétirement at age 50 (in late 1974). He is and will be until then a

valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.

4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last

decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

MEMORANDUM. FOR:

Career Management Group

Mid-Caréer Officer Branch

SUBJECT

Recommendation for the Promotion of Calvin W. Hicks: (056361)

to 6S-14

•T..

I would again like to recommend the promotion of subject officer from

GS-13 to GS- 14.

Mr.. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967

and his performance has been characterized.consistently. by exceptional proficiency.

He serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers ‹ doing identical work,

some of whom are currently in GS-14.

A medical hold has precluded any further. overseas assignments and for

this reason his stay in IW has been extended until November 1974, when he will

be 50-years-old at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement

system.

Mr. Hicks* resourcefulness and 'ability to apply the multitude of

reporting instructions and techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in

crisis situations

such as the recent Chilean coup and the Middle-Eastern crisis.

He has conststently displayed initiative and. good judgment in meeting unforeseen

crisis with rapid and effective

action and has clearly demonstrated his ability.

to continuously adjust to rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.

For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received

a quality step increase in recognition

and as proof of the high

esteem in which

he is held by his superiors.

a GS-14 slot. His promotion is again

recommended in recognition of his long years of Agency service.

I recommend that a Quality Step Increase be

• 220

Mr.. Hicks is.one of three officers in the intel-

ligence Watch, FI Staff,

on whom identical recommendations

are being submitted.

These officers, all in grade GS- 13,

have for several years done responsible and demanding work,

identical to thnt done in the

same office by live other of

ficers, :GS-14 and 15, and

all three' have been rated "Strong."

The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence

dissemination office.of

the Clandestine Service.

put of over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product

of CS collection operations.

Watch Officers serve on a

rotating schedule..When an officer draws the night shift

he serves alone.

He must make quick, independent dissemina-

•tion decisions.

Mr. Hicks has done well at this work.

is alert and consclentious and, has

a sharp operational sensé

which is extremely useful in the handling of cs intelligence

information. He has been recommended several times for pro

motion to GS-14.

The high quality of Nr. Hicks's performance has

continued for more than two years.

There is no reason to

expect any decline-in 1t." His enthusiasm continues,

his tour has recently been extended for another two years.

5. Consideration has been given to recommending him

a Quality Step Increase would be more approprfate.

I reconmend the promotion of subject officer from GS-13 to

15. Kicke has been ansigned to tre Intolligence WatchFI Staff

since

June 1067,

and sorves on a rotating schedule with seven'other

officers doing identical work, five of whom are. currently in Grade C-14.

2. My. Hicka has been with IN for ilmost two years and his work;

both quantitatively nd qualitatively han been consistently of a very

high enliber.. Normally six months are required bofore an officer nevly

assipned to the Intölligence watch 1s nble to handle a shift by himself.

At least a year is required tefore & watch Officer can perform at a high

level of proficiency,

However, in the case of this officer, in a little

more than a year he had earned the inting of "Strong" and has mintained

1t ever since.

Although most of his lgency experience had been in para

military operntions, he adapted quickly to the demands of his new assig

ment.

Ills keenly developed fense of operntionnl security,

coupled with

his. clear understanding of the relationship between operntions and

Intelligence, has mede him a very fine officer and a maluable arset to

No: Pe has been under my supervision for 16 months and & have had ample

opportunity to observe his performance under conditions o stress. He 1s

even tampered and level hended. His'mistakes are few and infrequent and

these are usually of the clerlinl varlety, not in matters of judgment. I

contire to be Impressed with his thoroughness in handling Information;

with the evidence of his coordination when the Interests of more then one

division are involved. Since operations have to be submerged and the

EDWARD J: CARROLL

CHIEF, FI/INT/IW

ATTACHMENT

I heartily endorse this recommendation that Mr. Hicks be

promoted to GS-14. As his supervisor points out, Mr. Hicks,

when he came to the Intelligence Watch, was essentially a

guerrilla warfare field operational aficer. Positive intelll-

gence information reporting and the handling of reports were

new to hiin; and called for professional skills and other

qualities radically different from those which most of his

previous exuerience had brought into play.

Yet in a relatively

short time, Mr. Hicks has developed the skills required of a

Watch Officer, and thanks to this and to other strengths has

become one of the most valuable diicers in the unit.

was "granted a Quality' Step Increase: in recognition and as proof of the high esteem

in which he is held by his supervisor in the Clandestine Service.

Mr.'Hicks' services have been particularty valuable during this reporting period

because of DDP's lacreased concern regarding the strict mantenance of operational

security in the dissemtnation of its intelligence information. Mr. Micks has been in-

strumental in referring many. reports when in the opinion of tw officers, the authen-

tication stätement and the manner in which the report is written would help to pinpoint

the source of the information if the report feli in unauthorized hands.

notations on the Il log cards which record the action taken on each report indicate che

sertousness, in which Mr. Hicks. approaches his dafly tasks and his contributions in

reminding Divistonal personnel about the essential elements of good reporting and the

need to comply with the prescribed. format.

The exercise of good judgment in referring or consulting on an Intel Cable prior to

Its dissemination to the Intelligence Community is an essential element in the proper

functtoning of this office and upon which depends to a certain extent the Agency's

reputation.

With the retirement and reassignment of severa? Il officers during this reporting

perlod; Mr. Hicks

is

now the Il officer with the most experience and continuity on the

This together with his maturity of judgment and ability to withstand the rigors and

COURSE CBJECTIVES AND METHOD.

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories

contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid

tefms: evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action

skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique

for problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization

Custure and Dévelopment.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of

In

-Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective

solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly

assessed,

Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectivenes.

Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might

change hie own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectivenerg.

Thua

managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing

themselves.

About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights

gained are deepened and personalised during. the intensive 50-hour Seminar.

Ma. Hicks is a mature and

thoughtful individual who made

the switch

from PM to FI activities

was originally

scheduled

field assignment to & Wl Station

in the fall of 1966, but for medical reasons will probably be

staying nt Headquarters for some

While this restriction

may. linit his ability to get that feel for FI field operations

which & Headquarters desk officer should have, he has previous

field experience in a PM capacity to compensate for this.

NAIL ROUN

Mr. Hicks'

primary responsibility. has been to provide Head-

quarters

support. and

guidance

for the Pl activities directed by the

Miami Station against

the Cuban

target.

Mr. Hicks has shown a bigh

degree

of professional judgment in carrying out his duties, and his

judgmen't is respected by senior officials who are réquired

to submit

the

PM programs for high-level approval. During operational phases

of the Pl programs, Mr.: Hicks is frequently required to be on call

to act on emergency situations on a 24-hour basis.

He has accepted

this responsibility willingly. He has consistently taken the

initia

tive in

investigating technical developments which might provide

assistance to the Station

in the conduct of PM operations.

He now

supervises two professional and two clerical employees in his Section

and runs his unit smoothly.

with no discernible friction..

'He does a

good job of briefing and indoctrinating junior officers.

While his

experience has been predominantly

in the Py field, he has acquired

FI experience in the

last tro year's because of the unique nature of

•Cuban PM (FI) operations.. In his consideiation of budgetary matters,

he has demonstrated an

understanding of the need to curtail expenses,

where feasible.

I would be glad to have ir. Hicks work with me at

any future time.

The GS-13 Evaluation Board for FY 1972, having carefully reviewed

the performance..or all'officers, in grade GS-13 according to the standards

of HR 20-31a (3)(b), reconmends Mr. Calvin.W. Hicks for a Quality Step

Increase.

2.

Mr. Hicks performed in a supertor manner: as a paramilitary officer

turing the early years.

of his career,

overseas and in Headquarters.

-medical hold on overseas duty led to his assignment in 1967 to the Intelli

gence Watch/Fl Staff where he has remained up

to the present.

Mr. Hicks

has'received overall.ratings.of.strong" from 1968 through 1971, with his

performance characterized.as exceptionally:proficient.

Of the seven-

officers with whom he serves on a rotating basis

four are GS-14's:

The

FI. Staff has recommended Mr. Hicks for promotion

in 1968, 1969, 1971 and

1972, with a recommendation for QSI in 1970. None of these recommenda-

tions were approved.

The Board has noted that Mr. Hicks plans to retire in 1974 at

the age of 50.

In view of the very high regard in which he is held by

the FI Staff; his record of sustained superior performance and his high

dedication to the Agency, the Board recommends recognition in the forin

of a Quality Step Increase for Mr. Hicks.
