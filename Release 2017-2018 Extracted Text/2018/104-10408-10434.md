SUBJECI: Travel of Lee Harvey OSWALD

I. The following information has been gathered frona

reliable sources regarding the travel of Lee Harvey OSWALD

and hia wife:

#, 2 October 1959: According to aficial

British travel recorde OSWALD arrived in

Southampton thia date claiming on his landing card

that he had no fixed address but planned to remain

in the United Kingdom one week for vacation before

going on to "some school" in Switzerland. (Head-

quarters comment: Probably referring to the

Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland with which

ho is knows to have been in correspondence.)

Do 10 October 1959: According to the same

oíficial Britiah travel recorde OSWALD left London

this date by air for Helainki.

c. October 1959: Stockbalm newspaper, Dagena

Nyheter, of 25 November 1963 stated Lee OSWALD

passed through Swedea during October 195% Artiele

also adde that OSWALD was unsuccessful in obtaining

visa to the USSR in Helsinki which resulted in his

returning to Stockholm, Two days after he arrived in

Stockhoin OSWALD traveled directly to Moscow,

Concluding sentence of article states "This indicates

that the Russian Embassy (Stockhols) gave hita a viet. "

According to a reliable source there was no record

that there was any requeat for a USSB visa processed

through normal channele for OSWALD at any time

during 195% and spurce indicated it was difficult to

explain how OSWAID might have received his visa in

two days without going thi ough nor mal channels. The

oly conclusion which can be drawn is that OSWALD

must have received his visa directly from the Soviet

Embassy in Stockholm which occasionally in done in

special cases, but the source had no evidence to confirm

this assumption.

do 10 to 13 October 1952: According to a very )

at the Torni Hotel in Helsinki from 10 to 1l October and

then moved to the Klaus Turki Hotel where he stayed

until 15 October, apparently waiting for a visa to be

issued him by the Soviet Consulate la Helsinki, Fie

traveled to the USSR by train, crossing at Vairikkala on

15 October.

co 13 May 1902: According to a Dutch official

source, the Dutch Charge in Moscow issued a transit

visa to OSWAiD's wile on 13 May 1962, Their records

reveal his wife was born on 17 Jwly 1941 instead of

19 July 1941 and in Severodvinak instead of Minsk.

There is no record of her having actually transited

The Netherlands.

fo 1962: Official British records do not reflect

that OSWALD returned to the United States from the

USSR through the United Kingdom. However, If be

were merely transiting, it vould not bave been

necessary for him to fill out a landing card, and

thereine there would be no record of his travel in

the official traffic inder.
