MFMORANDUM FORs Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

““gveety = Crusade for Frvodom and National Infomation Murcaa

1. On January 10th I called your attention to the fact that
the National Infomation Pureau, a reputable investigation agency
which conduets inguiries into ciaritalle orgenl zations and advises
large donors, had given an advorse recomuondation on the Crusade
‘for Freedom (seo Attachnont 1). Tals catter hao now risen again.
It nay be that it would be ulse to undertake a high-level approach
to the Bureau throug yourself or General Smith, for tho following

reavons

According to an acreemont with us and with the State
Department at our recent meetings, Crusade for Freedom will bank
heavily this yoar on donations fro: corporations. They havo now
discovered that these corporations rcly to a great extent on the
Wational Information Evrcau's atvice. Sevoral corporations have
indicated the’, according to their practice, they canaot give to
the Crusade unless it has the Meseing of the Eureau, and you will
note in Attaclent 2 that one sci corporation = Barnes Nanufactur-
ing Company of Mansfield, Ohio — has written to the Crusade citing

its doubt.

2. Meantime, sembors 5f the Crusade Gave ad conversations
with D. vaul Keed, Fxecutive Dirsctor of tne National Information
Bureau (see Attaclusent 3) and he tas insisted that ne cannot report
that the Crusade vas nat the baste standards in padlanthropy until
his Standards 7 and § are not. Tuesa are the cuilication of an
annual audit and of a detailed annual budget, the prime requirenent
being the disclosure of totals.

3. You nay want to read tils Attachment 3 with care tut I
cannot myself see any manner in waici we can meet these standards.
Tserefore, I believe that it nay be necessary to meke the ap-roach
to the National Information Fursm descrited alove.

HORVAT, Pavle

s Pavle Horvat is of Slovenian oririn, atout 50 years old and was
born in the Priekija district near the Kuncarian border (formerly a

part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy).

Horvat became known durin: the thirties throuch his numerous
manifestos and posters by which he attexpted to organize his om = -
political movenent. This "moverent" was labeled various naries at
different tines, At one time it was sinnly referred to as a "peasant
movenent," at another time as the "Slovenia Section of the Croatian
Peasant Party," and still later as an "inderendent Slovenian peasant
rioverent." He never had, however, any following and never set up his
own electoral lists, On the other hand, it is true, that the Croat
Peasant Party of Dr. “acek considered him as one of its trustees in
Slovenia for a short period.

He earned his living as a farmer, He also had a srall village
rrocery shop aid occupied himself in his district with "interventions,"
that 18, performing ail types of secretarial services for the peasants
of the area, A,ong other things, he undertook to organize the
transportation of the seasonal. workers who vent to Frence and
Gernary during the harvesting months. He had difficulties with the
hone authorities and police in this respect and had to apvear before
the courts on a number of occasions.

At the beginning of the wr he fled to Lagreb, Croatia, at that
time the Independent Croat State (Nazi purpet regime) of Dr. Pavelic.
There he set up a smal) office for the relief of Slovenian refugees
but it never reached any large rroportions. He was not connected
with the Refugee Committee which handled the main relief work (Cne
source tointed out that the rere fact that he vas able to ostabtish
an office and function i:. Zagreb during the period meant that he was
at least passively acceptable to the Nazi regime.

As far back as 1935 he is !mown to hzve misrepresented himseif
as a “peasant leader.”

After the war Pavle Horvat fled to Austria where he acsin claimed
to be a Slovenian peasant leader and atterpted to whip up propaganda
for the creation of a srecial "peasant group," anong the Slovenian
refuzees; he failed coxrlete?y. He vas uncble to find follovers in
a single cacp to forn such a group, and the refugees refused to attend
his meetings. In addition he is known to have boasted that he was
acting on behalf of Hr, hacek and the International Peasant Union,
though he was mandated by neither. The Allied authorities were
finally forced to intervene and bring; a stop to his activities since
they were causing discontent anong the refugees and disorders in the

DP caxpse



In July 19L9, Horvat wrote the Honorable Joserh C, Grew in care

of the National Committee for a Free Europe introducing himself as
the Representative of ‘the Nexocratic Slovenes and President of the
Interrationa] Peasant Union for Eurore, and suz-esting that he join
forces vith the Comuittee in the comon struqle against Communism,
‘In return for a trip to the United States he offered to bring a

large confidential rerort on his activities to date and present a
scheme for successfully sunpressing communism and delivering the
sutsupated nations in the shortest tossible time. He was informed
that the Fund was confining its activities to refugee leaders already
residing in the United States and that the prorosed visit was
imozsible at that time.

Horvat has recently announced his forthcoming arrival in the

> United States, Several Slovenian and Croatian nevspapers in this
country have received articles (which he wrote himself) glorifying

hig past and present activities, None of them, so far, have taken any
notice of these articles with the excertion of the Croat separatist
(pro-ustashi) paper, "DANTCA," published in Chicayo. Supposedly

Dr. “acek was highly amused on reading the article describing the
great "Slovene peasant leader.”

Nobody in Slovenia in pre-war days would have considered Favel
Hervat as a person to be taken seriously in public life. He is
considered by a number of sources a political impostor and as
personally unethical, Neither tre Int. ional Peasant Union for
Europe, of which he claimed to be president, nor the Denocratie
Slovenes, of which he is a repres.ntative, is consicered a levitimate
organization, The Director of the Func's Yugoslavian Research and
Infornaticn Desk was the editor of a daily paper in Slovenian for
eleven years before the war. He never net iiorvath, seldom heard of
nim and his perer, as far as he knew, never took notice of him or his

activitles.

FOR THE RECORD: This rerort (on Pavle Horvat dated § arch 1952)
was forvarded to us by hr, John Leich, assistant to -r, Dolbeare,
Director of the National Councils Division of NcFE,

MENORANDUM FOR? ASSISTANT PIRACTCR FOR POLICY COORTINATION
- “SUBJECT: NCEE

1, For quite sone time the staf! ofticers of this divigion concerned
with utilising the facilities of the NC! and with-oxploiting the
Albanian, Bulgarian, and Rumanian enigrations have been evare of a lack
of adequate coordination between our ow activities and those of the
NCFE atarf, 4n conjunction with thoge r¥ Civision officers reapensible
for handling our relations with that organisation, we have attempted
te explore the problem in arder to find a solution which could be

considered realistic and practical.

2. The difficulty.lles not only 1n the communication system between
OPC and NCE, which does not alwaye transmit, at exactly the richt time,
the right ideas from one organisation to the proper individuals at the
right lovel nthe other, ‘lthench ve hava maintained very close contact
both informally and through formal channels, only too often we have not
been in a position to learn why NCE staff officers have made a givon decis~ i
fon in regard to some emigre organisation in which we had an interest; and
on the other hand, our desirea and needs have not always been fully under=
stood or accepted in New York. Again, it has happened that we were
ignorant of developments that closely affected ovr operations until it
vas too late for us to maxe o.r influence felt, and, correspondingly,
- it must be admitted that we have oursolver pushed atead with courses of
action without adequately briesing the NCFL, Tne most extreme cage in
point known to ue concerns the Rumanian exigration, where we and NCFE
are now pursuing conflicting policies. Ihe upshot of this has deen the
gradual development of a situation wherein OrC ie supporting an orgamnise-
tion, the NCrc, which is'not fully responsive to it.

3, Thia situation is not regarded by us as reflecting any fundamental
Anadaquacy in NCFé, or as ;resenting any insoluable difficulty. hore
exists a problem in staff interrelationship which can and should be
resolved by 4 reform in our organigational ap,roach, The goal toward which
we believe we should work is one where OrC communication with KCHE would
be channelled directly along a single high-level line which wo:ld firmly ‘
the in AirC's office with thit of the head of the other organisation.
Tieas, suggestions, information, etc. vould flow, in the regular channels,
up from the OPC working level to A7?C's office for review anz transaiasion
to the top office of NC*E, and flow down fron there through N7F2's usual
channele to the proper individuals in its.operational machinery, ‘ersonal
contacts between individuals at a lover level in the two organisations
would frequently occur to supplement thie agual crannel, when security >
permitted, but should be in the hands of responsible personnel who
understand the OPC policies involved.

the establistment of thia post, with a suitable individual assigned to the

that persons purporting to represent underground movements in Poland, the

THE “VOICE” AND RADIO FREE EUROPE

Both Are Indispensable |
}
“ow . . -

"What's the diference berween the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe?” “Why
is it necessary to hive buth the Voice and Radio Free Europe?” "These are frequent questions
atked of General Clay and the other leaders of the Crusade for Freedom.

The Voice and Radio Free Europe ate both vitally nceded if we are to win the
Cold War. i

‘They are completely separate organizations. Each performs a distinct function in the fight
against the gigantic Soviet propaganda machine.

‘The Voice speaks with the authority of the U. S. Government. I is financed by Govern
ment funds,

Radio Free Europe was set up by private citizens. Ic is financed by millions of individual
contributions to the Crusade for Freedom.

Voice is World Wide

The voice is a worldwide network, broadcasting in 46 languages over 75 transmitters. fe
is the only American voice heard in the Soviet Union. Its 120 indwidual daily programs of
news, music, roundtables, conimentaries, documentaries, Service programs, etc., have a potential
audience of 300,000,000 listeners.

Radio Free Europe is much smaller. It concentrates on the captive countries behind the
Tron Curtain: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania. Its cransmit-
ters are in Western Europe.

The Voice speaks for the American people, spreading the truth about democracy, giving a
true picture of- life in the United States, and spiking Moscow's lies about us. It repcrts in full
on official American acts and documents, presents news and world developments from our
point of view.

But Voice is not limited to Government pronouncements; it regularly reflects American
opinion as expressed in our press and radio. Ina friendly way—with programs of informa-
tion and service—it promotes a better understanding of the United Seates in Europe, in Latin
America, the Far East and the Near East, i

Exiles Speak Over RFE

Radio Free! Europe, on the other hand, does not portray America. It concenteares largely
on what is taking place within the slave.countries. Over its transmitters Poles speak to Poles,

Hungarians to Hungarians, etc. They speak'as “the voice of Free Poland,” “the voice of Free

Hungary.” etc. They look at their people's problems through their own eyes.

“RFE programs specialize in identifying and denouncing Communist informers and collab-
orators, sending back messages from escapees, and exposirig the corruption and crimes within
the Red regimes.

In theie broadcasts to behind the Iron Curtain, the Voice and-Radio Free Europe have es-
sentially the same aims: ¢o keep alive the hope of liberation; to let listeners know that they
have not been forgotten; to stitfen their resistance against their Communist oppressors; t0 €x-
pose the fraudulent basis of authority upon which the Moscow-dominated regimes rest.

Both combat ‘Communism and the persecution of-religion and denial of human rights.
Both repore the superior industrial power and fighting potential of the free world over the
Soviecenslaved world,

1951 Year of Progress for “Voice”

Daring the pase year the Voice of America:

1, Stepped up daily programming from 30 to 50 hours daily.

2. Made progress in overcoming Soviet jamming.

Dear ALotts

Ihave Just been informed over the telephone
that Earle jocers. of Counsel Services, Inc., has called
& meting of the Crusade for Freedom Comittee in this
ity, and hao failed to consult me in any way in this
mB tere

This hes resulted, as usual, in causing
utter confusion in the ninds of everyono, and bodes no
good for the Giusade in this city nor for the sponsoring
oryninatlon ~ the National Co:nl tue for a Yroe Europe,
for wiich the Crusade is opurnting. In your lotter of
Docember 7, 1951, to tr. Hulbert T. Bicse:le, Chairmn of
the Crusade for Freedom in the District of Columbia, you
desigrated m as, Director of tho wadhirgton, 1.0, office.
AS I lave received no inctrustions fros you to the con=
trary, I have presumed this situation to te continuing.

The fact that ur. Rogers would proceed in a
matter of thiz Kind without contultaticn with tnis office,
and without being co:misaloned by you to widertake ouch @
mocting, is most visturbing. This te the ort of thing
that will really kill the Crusade for Freecow in this city.

I ehall hope to discuss this otter with you
when in New York on Thursday,

Sincerely yours,

This letter concerrs the matter which I discussed with you
briefly lest week.

For some months pest toth the officers end directors of the
NCFE have been concerned 2s to what protective steps could be taken
in behalf of foreign naticnsls working for Radio Free Furope in
Germany under conditions wiich might arise in certain eventualities,

I attuch copy of s letter becring on tiis mttor which was
written by Lang to Gates Lloyd on Novembor 5, 1951. It gives a
concise cutline of the problea and suggests @ solution cf the some.
To date, ec fer as I knox, we have not boen able to secure eny
assurances thut this 1s being tzken care of. If, us we have been
informed, tho Army cuthorities in Germany era willing te help ugon
receiving clearance fro the Department of Defense, we feel every
effort should be made to izrlemont this promptly.

el present und potential future value of
the foreign nationals in the group, the Committee feels thot it has
a definite mors] obligsti:n to seek the sure degree of assist nee
und protection for then 2s wuld be efforded United States citizens
under the ecnditions referred to.

Apart fr-m the very

Personally, I feel this obiigation is e broeder cne which ex-

tends te this Goverrzent ss vell.

Last Tuursdey when ve were discussing this question In Kew
York, Jce Grew was cuch ixterested ard sid he would be glrd to cesist
in any way possible, We sii felt, hevever, this 1s not a etter
which the Comittee can up direct with the Defense Depertrent or
other Government cgencies thet At ecn only be brought to a
Proper solution through seticn -n the part of the Director or yourself.

, Purgeriens, Poles (at un enrly dete), lerye numters of Gerren
Meusexeepirg urd enganeering personnel, plus a fev Fronch, Swiss, j
Belgtere, Pritish, ete. Full deteils on the disposition of the staff
ere evedlatle in Munich and heve been turned over to EUCOM ih an effort :
to Luterect EUCOM in the most sericus problem which faces us tcday -

thet of evecustion in the event of a move by any of the Russian armies.

Through Lt. Co. Ciccolelle we have been fortunute enough to
ur /merican personnel included in the evacuation plen of the : :
Fest Commend. At this writing, however, we stind to lose nur

extrecriizerity cepeble, well trained ard ecnzletely vestorn-ortented

foreign staff.

M, on its own, hes done sll thet it con but needs a directive
Dezertuent of Defense in Washington to the effect tht the
PFE staff 1s t8 be considered a "war ascet" und given e high pricrity
on the evecustion schedule. This priority should include the foreign
ned Into the PPE effort since vithcut them

Our investigations, snd very ccensidercble vork done :n the field
EUCOM is more then witling to ,

would te lost in this "pescetine" effort, end vithcut their Suture

MEMORANDUM OF OONVFRSATION

Present were Hossrs. Jackson and Washburn of BCPE, Kessra. Borrett,
doyes, Devine, Sargeant and Kohler froa State, avi Messrs. Dull
Wisner, and Eraden from CIA. The meeting was held in
Bre Barrett's office on 17 January at h:30 pm.

ONCIUSON: That the Crusade for Freedom organization should continous.

The Mllowing is a tranccript of Kr. Bradan’s notes of the
meoting.

C. D. led off, adnitting the frustrations that a long campaign
on the Crusade for Precdom caused to the State Departaent and sug-
gested the following progres:

le A leday bdell-ringing campaign in ail cities.
2 Direct mail to corporations.

At this point, Hr. kachturn interjected to agy that he wuld need
about two weeks of "low drums" promotion before tis i-day

Jackson vent on to say that ‘under such a schame tzere would be no
time en ths part of the chaimon for a build-up of invidious eamari-
gona in the press. At Jackson's request, Kr. kashburn passed sround
@ Crusade publication entitled "Tne Yoloo of dmarica - 1951 + A Year
of Frogreas". YTais brochuro, which in four pares ;raisee highly the
wort of the Voice of Amoriea, is to be nailed ly tue Crusade to (te
chief contrituters.

ur. Barrett then mada the following points:

1. The National Comittee for a Free Europe grew out of the
idea of halping refugoes ond of giving then a voles. It has changed
ever the years to a huge operation wits many new ideas, end the
Crusade for Preedon caso slong a a necesai ty.

renarked that 1n a conversation with Aian Valentine ho hed fousd
that Valentino ie inclined to agrec with hin,

3. Against Mr. Wachburn and the Crusade for Freedom, he had
enly one complaint. ‘They were too good, too bigetinc. They mado
wuch an effective appeal tant the reeipients oouid not avoid running
down the competitor. Ho stated as tis opinion tnat the Crusade was
Joopardizing @ muitiemillion dollar operation == the Volce of America ==
and might even be jeopardizing anotser miltianiliion dollar operation <=
Radig Free Europe == for tho, sako of raining tiree million dollar.

4k. fle thought balloons and some other operations done by tho
CGormsittes were best done by private moan.

5. Ho leaned toward going back to thy beginning and looting
at the Crusade as purely land mot an attempt ta
raise largo funds and maldng a lot of hoopla. lle sugzeuted that the
Crusado snould raise only enough money and make only enough of @
empaign to provi He suggested mail colicita-
tion, magazine advertinements, tho publicising of two or three largo
enonymous gifts, all without hign-proscure. Then he said, "Lets
get on with the main Job of radio and refugees.”

i Mr. Dulleo asked whether this danger to the Voice wan so great.
"Didn't you get more moncy tiis year?" Barrottts answer tas “Ho?
and he pointed out that there was no damage done to the Voice by the
Crusade tnis year insofar-as finds wero concerned but he feared the
future. Dullos asked wastior we couldn't work out the timing of the

realised that mistakes had boon made and the Crusade had criticised
the Voice, otrditeteally the Crusade could be of enormaus hol) to
the Voleo by publicising the necd for comuunicating to people in
alavory.

Sargpant thoucht point 3 was tho most inportent. Ho asked whether
the Crunado couldn't be tled in with Utes point. Jackoon sald, "Yes,
amt wo aro atarting with thie issue of the Crusmler publiciaing the
Vole." Washturn added that 25 million contritnitore, counting this
yeor's and last yearta contributions, may provent cutting down the
operation ag Farrett sugcesta. They will raise a lot af queations.
Barrett disagreed and repeated his sugeoution of @ onoemonth cporation
eonfined to magagino adverticing and dirvot mail. Jackson asked atout
the magazine advertising. lie said you had to write copy for magazine
atvertiaing and tho copy would have to advertise Iadio Pree Furope.
Rarrett anowored, "You can control the copy on maresine ads. There
is a lot of time allowed for going ovor thom carefully before they got
into print.®

Wachturn repeated ooversl tiaos that it would be a creat shane to
let the Crusade go. Jackson said tie cruvade gave a real lift to
exilos not only hero tut abroad.

Rehler said he had been thinking about tho prohlem and had tw
seggeations te maker

1. Gould wo oxhort people to rive a dollar to fa:tlo free Furope
and at the sme tins to write a lettor to their Oongressmen backing up

the Voloe of Anorica? ’

& Onuld tho Radio Advivory Gmnittes of the Voice of Amorica
teas up tdth the Crurade to help with general publicity?

Jackson enowored the first question "No". Ha thought that would be
dangerous. To the socond question, he eald "Yan", Me again outlined
ie idea for a carpaicn calling for edugation on « xonerel paycholesi-
cal warfare progres with o final request to contritate to the Crusade,

Mr. Pullos again asked Hr. Barrett atout Ita financial problens
and the timing of his request to tho hill, Barrett said he would have

wondered whether wo cauld not asko the invintble ampocts visible.
He thought that to hold tho whole crusade organisation togethor for
@ yoar merely to conduct a twoewesk cacpaign would waote many good
men's tims. Barrett agreed that a two-veck campaign wouldn't keep
the organisation alive. i

Sargeant avkod Lf there wore pot othor ideas tmic: oould be fed
through the Crusade macuinery, thus aaking wore oonatructive use of
ite”

Varrett raised the question >f internationallaing tho Crusade
effort. Jackeon replied that there was an abortive Yreneh project
whieh he thought would shortly falh Maton ito face, Tho British,
he thought, would zhortly mako a final deciclon ac to whether to go
ahoed with an exile program or not. He seed dublous that they
would decide to do oo. He montianed Joan Faul David and i’aix at
Libverte as the only foreign operation in this field which had any
epark to it. Darrett agreed but asked enother or not same Furopeane
couldn't bo put on the Board of Directors. Dulles replied that thie
was very difficult, that thay couldn't attend wotings for one thing.
Barrott said, “Couldn't thers be an annual asoting siaply ag a front,

ea camouflage?"

Jackson said that NCFS did got tnvolved in European organisations,
that they had close affiliations wit: tne Furopean hove.ent, with the
Pree Trade Union Comittes in hile, wth the Intarnational Journalists,
vita Strasbourg University, and all the radio prograns were reaching
the point tere they wore thought of as prograns belonging to the people
whom they wore broadcast. MCFE had, ho tought, internationaliged
@ great deal and in a very natural way. A board of foreign direators
would epoil that natural process by getting up an obvious p:soney.

Deor Allent :

At_a meeting af the Executive Conwittee of the Board of N.C.F.E.
held on Jomucry 3rd Lett, th: nembecw felt that tuo of the subjects
diecunsed ot that tiue should be celled to your ettention go that you
might know the views of the Coumittee in the event. these mattcra were
brought before you st & later dete,

The first ceresrns » sugyection which apperently came Informlly
from McCluny end otmere in Amcomfree, thut if mesns could be fourd to
do 80, they be alloved to use sows of the R.P.E. facilities in Gerneny
for certein of their troedcusts. Since this catter was not brought up
a5 a formal request, no action wee teken by the Committee, tut the in-
dividual members urzrinously expreceed the opinicn that this would be
most inadvisuble erd thet ‘they would be opposed to the use of R.F.R.
fucilities for thie gurpore even if time and frevuencies wers aveil-
eble, which 4s not s% ell certein. Since Ancomfrce is an orgenization

it seems advisable to acquaint you

with our feelinge <2 tae cutter should you or your organization be
epproached by McClucy or othera on this cubject. without going into
details at this tine es to the reasons for our feeling.in tho mutter,
our min concern 1s tit Amconfree's targets ore envirely different
from those in whieh ve are interested, ond from the standpoint of
operation from Gerzr soil thoy ere far less likely to be agreeable to
BONN. We ere fearful of putting in Jeopardy 2 presently successful
operation and four t five million dollsre of equipaent by the intro-
duction of » project vaich wo feel should be kept separate and apart.

The other axtter which etme up for form] ection involved the
savdesbiLity of underteking Polieh ¢rogreming 4n Germany, and the
Executive Committee trantmously cereed that R.F.P. ehould proceed
vita the plens pre: In brief, auc! lens cell for the origine-
tion of from three t four tours deily of Polieh programing from Munich
teginning on or about ¥zy 1, 1952, end the introduction ef some 50 to
6 Poles into the city of Munich for work with R.F.E. to carry out

this schedule,

Since this is 2 s<Jor step in the development of R.F.E. progran-
ing end more perticulerly becouse of the fortheening negotiations be-
tween representatives of N.C.F.P., HICOG, or] BONH, Jt wos felt thet
you should be formelly sdviced of this decision. The Frecutive Com-
mittee also wanted ts co on record to the effect that while they
retlized the riuke involved, affirntive actich wes tekon as e result
of opinions given by Messra. Byroude, Kellermern urd Strauss of the

Desr Allen:

At the Grusade Board Noeting; lust Friday, C1. reported in detail on our
Beeting in Ed Sarrott's office.

This was followed by a general discussion of the nature aad scope of the
1952 Crusade progran, Briefly, there was agreencnt that the program in
1952 should be considerably reduced in scope, thet the emphasis should be
taken off publicity and placed on fund-raising with the promotional period
eing reduced from two monthe to two or three weeks. . It was felt that a
direct mail enapaicn to our present list of givers -~ plua a thorough
solicitation of corporstions -~ would be desirable.

There was discussion also of a one-night house-to-house canvass, nation-wide,
on Constitution Day next September. Hr. Poole sucgested that, in addition to
Radio Free Buropa, the 1952, Crusnde might place emphasis on the newly formed
Free Europe University in Exile at Strasbourg, France, General Clay
recomzended that tha Advertising Council's assistance in the new cumpaign

stated that on fr. C. b. Jackson's last trip to Portugal, the
authorities there acviged him that. ary Polish oxiles brought in
under tho aheve-toutioned circwastances would have to live under
eerditions approximating "house arrest," since the Portugese
governzcnt would not tolerste their circulating freely within the

eountry.

2. Later Fr. Spencer Phenix stated that he and Mr. 0:
‘Thenas believed that sone fev Poles could be brought in without
sech drastic actio: by the Portugese authorities. He also expreased
@oncern that the short wave commnications between Munich and Lisboa
wore not 100% aatiefactory for transmitting the Polish programs,
which aro then relayed out of Lisbon to Poland. He felt that
programzing in Portugal would be the best way to handle the problen
but eduitted that apprexiustely 100 people vould bo needed, and,
ender the eirousstances, he agroed that it was better to keep the

PROPOSED STATEMEN!

-

The National Committee for a Freo Furope is an organization of
private Anerican oltirens whose purpose 1a to encourage the spread
of freedom behind the Iron Curtain in Turope. It is a maaberesaip
corporation, chartered undor the laws of the State of New York.

In spreading the doctrine of freedom and combatting Soviet
totalitarianien, the Qomuitteo operates radio stations wilch piores
tho Iron Qurtain; in closo cooperation with the French authorities
and the Univoraity gf Strasbourg, it operates an educational ocntre
at Strasbourg for young men and women who have escaped from behind
the Iron Curtaing it attempts by othor meane than radio to carry
nestages of hope and of tho poscihility of eventual liberation to
the nationa wiich aro now enslaved; it conducts studies of the lays,
customs and cultures of theso nations av they exteted prior to
Soviot occupations and it documents the changes which have been
imposed by the Soviet #0 that if the time should come when the
people risé against their conquerors, they may more easily estab-

Leh contimity with their past.

In all of this work the Comiittes draws information and support
from many sources += from those who have escapod and wo mst resain
anonymous for fear of roprisals on thoir families at home, fron those
in this country who wish to work voluntarily for the cause of frecdon
abroad, from the American people at large, and from goverment agen-
cles which, in the American tradition, give all posciblo aid to
private chtisens engaged in a worthwille public case.

Pund raising for the Committee ia done by a subsidiary, the
Crusade for Freccom which, in the course of raising money, also
helps to keep before the Amorican people and people throughout the
world tho noed for spreading tho idea of froodom. For example, the
Freedom Bell, which now ringe regularly over the city of Berlin, was
the gift of sixteen million Asericans who contributed to the Crusade
for Freedom, All in all, signatures and voluntary donations fron
more than twenty-five million Auericans have come to the Crusade for
Freedom to date. Generous contributioi ave alco been made to tha
Committee by private foundations; and at the request of Governsent
agencies, certain specific research and other projects have been
undertaken and carried on with the assistance of funds provided by

the departments or agencies concerned.

A Board of Directors consicting of prominent American citisens
from all walks of life pass upon the policies and supervise tho

SUBJECTS Radj.o Free Europe

1, For your inforration the following report on Radio Freo Europe
Hungarian broadcasts was received here recently, although the informa-~
tion was obtainod last Warcht :

“a, Radio Free Europe broadcasts from MUNICH, Germany,
are more popular than the Voice of America prograns and its
news coverare is considered both current and based on authen=
tie sources, However, its commentaries on foreign politics
are severely criticised and allogedly the general opinion in
Hungary is that whoever writes this program has not the
slightest idea either of the conditions in Hungary or of the

general needs of the peoples

"v. There are also objections to the progran of News
Briefs (ROVAT ADASOK), This program 1s considered a nuisance
and isn't even listened to by those for whom it is intended,
By scheduling 25 and 30 minute propras specifically veamed
to different sepments of the population, such as: the women's
program, the church prorram, the farner's program, book and
movie reviews, etc., Radio Free Europe reduces its listening
audience to those no mirht be interested in tae specific
program, while the majority o: the listeners are forced either
to cease listening to their radios or change to another broad~
casting station, As a result, Radio Free Zurope has beon losing
its audience and the decline is especially noticeanle during
the progran of News Briefs whon the majority of the listeners
allegedly change over to the BRC program,

"c. The worxers are particularly interested in political
news and are in an excellent position to spread the news
throughout the factories, Afain the BAC appears to be the
nost popular station. Informint learned of the fate of ono
Inre HORVATH, @ proup leader in a Textile Mill in SZzGD,
HORVATH passed on sone news conzerning the activities of the
"Political Police® of SZeGED which he had criginally heard
on one of these foreirn broaicasts. This resulted in HOAVATH
being imnediutely transferred to DUMAPENTIRand ais “group”
was disbaniod.

after arranging aa appointment through his cousin, Senator Moody,
Mr. Serippe callud on the Director to discuss his proposal for a
“yriendahip Balloon Lift.* Certain materials relating to thia proposal
had previously been transmitted to the Director by Hr, Allen Dulles,

In reply to questioning, 4r. Sorips asserted that he was well
eequainted with the SCFé winds of Freedom campaign, in wich he bad
participated, but that he hed not discussed his present proposal with
CFs, :ie said he had talked to many American business men, wno were
ll enthusiastic and were prepared to donate the variety of products
Which he proposes sould be included in the payloads. He said thet his
father was an ardent supporter of the project, along with a Ar. Fletcher,
Vice President of the Caterpillar Tractor Company and Ur. Harnctte
Hr. Fletcher epent sone tino in Russia, ho said. when asked vhethor
Caterpillar was in the balloon business, Hr, Scripps said nds

Other nanes manticned by Hr, Scripps as being faailiar with ois
proposal included Nick Haredi, identified as an exaninister of the
Hungarian Government; Frank Jewitt of Ganeral ‘ills (which holds a
balloon research contract with the Uffice of Naval ‘tesearch), wno haa
given hia a letter to an adairaly an Admiral <illers and a
Of CIA. (see below) Hr. Scripps also mentioned a ‘Paychological squip=
ment Developnent Uffice 1cczted in the old rust Uffice building,

(see below)

Mr. Serippa vas troubled by security problens, It was apmrent
that he felt he had obtained confidential information from cartain govern=
Bent sources which he could not discl io «At the sane time, he stated
thet in order to vork out hie proposal in any detail, he would neod
access to information presently denied hin, Therefore, no suggested
that he be cleared Jor security by the appropriate agencys

4s a result, it proved impossible to nail down the technical
aspects of Hr. Seriges' proposal, In bis formal presentetioa, he bad
@oscribed @ balloon capable of carrying a h0~pound payload ani costing
$5. In hie conversstion, he mentioned a vehicle capable of carrying
300 to 800 pounds, together with « stagrored release mechenisn--without



Price, To questions as to whothor either type was in existence, fre
Seripps roplied that he was bound by confidenees, In general, however,
be did not foresee any technical barriers.

_
When asked how he would finance his proposal, tir. Serippo said
that he would begin with private contributions, with the thought that
eventually the program would be taken over-by the govexnaent. lle laid
stresa.on the need for early organization (oes fund raising, balloon:
stockpiling, crew training, selection of leunching sites) in onier
operatioas could ba started immediately following a decision as to
desirsbilitys He atuted that 90 days would pe sufficient to prepare
for operations, once he got the "green Light".

Dr, Allen expressed his personal interest in the proposal, but
reminded Hr. Scrippo that PSU's field vas strategic rather than oparae
tional, and that in an opérational proposal of euch complerity, P&B
sould oaly give the mattor a cursury review, Therefore, ir. allen stated
hie intention to forward the propusal to the Psychological Uperations
Coordir ating Comuittea, whica was the proper body to give the project
the detailed screening to which it was entitled, Ur, Allen also suge
gested that Hr, Scrippa see C. D, Jackson,

Mr. Sorderg then euggested that ss an additional aid ir, Scripps
prepere a brief but fairly specific description of what he personally
was prepared to do, along with an outline of tie organization which would
be nesded to carry out the project. ir. Seripps eaia that he would do

COMERE

when asked about Mr. Scripss, said he had met hin several
tines between Decenber 1950 and February, 1951, During this periad of

NCFE EXILe Pino Wilh). SLLACTION I HeLATION TO

A. Formative Stage

Mt its cegtion, the National Comdttee for a Pree Lurope
belleved that its Iron Curtain broadcasting operation, kadio Free
Europe, could and sheila be develozed and pursiund through the medium
of “National Councils* or “Committees of Liberation" composed of
exile groups fron tne target countries, It was considered that
of each nationality group

prominent exile leaders and personalitsi
e countrymen, entirely without Anerican

could expi to their cay

’ advice and guidance, tie message of hore wnich NCP proposed to send.
This concept was not fu:filled, Experience in attexpting to weld a
talented, dedicated group of exiles into a non-partisa, broadcsating
operation early denonstratet that without Auerican control the rission
of KYE would be lost in t:e jungle of extle-world politics. It soon
becaze evident that the leacership among the exiles was neither suffi-

elently strong nor personally willing to rise above tie political cross

currents, factional rivalries, and splinter-group wealmesses character=

Astically reniniscent of the political affairs of all Lastern -uropean

countries, These factors eiliteted against the original plan of pernitting


exiles, through their loosely orranized Councils or Comittees, to
wholly develop, manage, and contrcl RFE broadcasting. :

Since the advent of RFL was tne most inportant developaent
affecting the exiles wich iad occurred since their fli¢ht fro: hone,
ther quickly understood and applauded its implications and potential
effect on their futures, Tnrourh this instrument they could once
again becone prominent and powerful in the affairs of the hocelands
once sore they cowld contend for place and power.

Sslection of personnel for tie purpose at hand quickly became
a political football of rival leaders, personalities, and groups.
Rightists, Leftists, Centriets, Labor Elements, and Splinter-groups
argued with us for advancenent of their particular personal or political
views. Sponsorship of their own adherents as RFE exployees through whoa
such views Would be broadenst to their captive countrymen becare the
pattern of their pseudo cooperation, This pattern was followed to such
an extent that ordinary progress and sensible developsent of our basie
purpose of truly free broadcasts under exile control soon appeared to
be sot only impracticable, but dangerous, For exacple, the National
Councils Division attenpted to inaugurate broadcaste to Czechoslovakia
under the auspices of a Czechoslovak National Council, The Council was
of differiny political views and

aud is nade up of exile personali
parties, Its factions proceeded to enrage in endless disputes and ire
Teesncilatle cloins for control of seript production and progran content.

oought that objective, wnile Crechs desired opposite views to be aired
and advocated the rebirth of pre-war Creshoslovakia, Lach group sponsored
and insieted upon employment of its own nore or less qualified adherents
upon the assucption that its special views would te thereby expreosed
to the captive Czechoslovak audience of RFL. Similar activities were
pursued by Hungarians, Fulgartans, and Poles until the futility of per=
mitting the exile Councils to control the destiny and broadcasting
policies of RFE was wade clear beyond refutation, It becane tragically
obvious that uncontrolled extle-world Councils and professional poli=
tictans could not agree on personnel selection or program contents

In spite of every effort to induce harmony in and obtain proper
cooperation fro: the "Councils", "Comalttees", and individuals, RPL was
confronted with an inpasse. The alternative tieory and present policy
of Anerican selection of non-political exile personnel was the only way
out, It has worked, Technically qualified personnel produce properly
oriented proprazs -- and have beer, doing so with docurented success
since July, 1950, Disappointed exile politicians, professional exile
camp followers, disturbed American special pleaders, and alarned Communist

Agents all screaz, snipe and snivel — but RFE programs are doing the Job,

can be supplied by Frederic R.

Dolbeare, Vice-President, Nationsi Councils Uivision, and Robert E. Lang,
Director, RFL, The current policy has the complete endorsement of these

officers and of the Board of Directors of NCFE.

Development Stage

Upon the collapse of the original concept of broadcasting under
exile auspices, RFE necessarily utilized soue exile personnel endorsed
fe recomended by the leaders of the various nationality yroups. As
technical radio facllities ease into being, exties with radio background
or writing talent were required for the production of prograne, This
involved using individuals eutnently qualified ty experience to do a
radio Job of script writing, announcing, acting, etc. without regard
for the fact that such individuals wight be at odds with one or another
political faction or leader of aa exile "Council", It also involved
elisination of proven inefficient, inept or unworthy individuals without
regard for their exile "Council" sponsorship, In either instance erit~

icisa of RFE was predictable and indeed was always forthcoming =~ often

in virulent and dishonest fors,

The day to, dey operation of RFE developed new techniques and
long range plans wich made t {:possible to esploy non-entities of no
political color or conviction, The best people to produce programs in
harmony with NCFE-RFE purposes and policies necessarily were persons
known in their own countries for their views on donestic political af
fairs and their antiCommatet activities, Hard-nitting propaganda
required hard-hitting personalities wnose known association with KFE
and its prograzs would add validity and sigalfieance for our captive
audiences, Gradually, therefore, the nationality desks of RFE at New
York and Municn were staffed with testeu, qualified exiles wo had been



Adontified publicly with doseotic political philosophies at issue in
their own countries. Many, in fact most of the staff pecple ure gone
troversial figures axong tiiotr ow: countrymen in exactly the sane way
that prominent Americans are controversial in our political arena, Many
{adeed aro mombers of the Councils, but are men of sufficient stature
to give their primary allegiances to the non-partisan policy of RFE, The
decisive factor is that there be no controversy or question about their

anti-Commniat convictions and records,

At this point, it mot be noted that our target countrios have
been subject to repetitive political ferment prior to and following

World var IT, as well as the successive occupations of Nasi and Communist

Arnit

The temper of the tines, therefore, in which these exiles have
lived for the past fifteen years nas been one of exeitexent, bitterness,
.Pecrimination, rivalries, and personal turaoil —- all eterming frou both

doweatic and foreign atrug, les for power. The tines have pradysed a

bunper crop of refugee traitors, collaborators, und opportunists and at
the same time have developed pure Western style democrats, true national
patriots, and unselfieh honest wen, The exile who stood by placidly

ch rood, however talented, ag a militant messen-

through the era is not
ger of hope via RFE; exiles wno were honora’ly active in public affairs

at hore and who had radio talent were, therefore, the only kind of
personnel suitable for RFE purposes.
Ae the necessity for Azerican operational control of nationality

desks tecaze self-evident, the only feasible personnel policy was to



tae

employ properly qualified individuals, regardless of exile politics.
In the execution of this policy individuals » o were useless were
eliminated without regard ser political sponsors. This process otill
goou on, Sintlarly, talented oxile personalities recruited frou any
source were employed wherever needed. This process atill foes on,

Both processes are in vopue with a healthy diereyard for exile political

protests, livither process 1a satisfactory to self. styled

Ae General Comment

The prorrano alred wy KFE are not left to whim or chance, All
program and the ‘personnel responsible for then are controlled by a
written policy manual, The manual sets forth in ninute detail the
position und policy of iW on every topie beared t. our target countries,
The marual 1s the daily guidance of all employees, both American and
Exile; deviation from its rules 19 not pernitted. Continuous serutiry
of manuscripts and rosultant broadcasts 1s naintained by Anerican en

ployees to insure that there are no deviations,

The policy manual of KFE represents the considered views of
the responsible officials, including the Board of Uirectors, of NCFE,
It ie a statement of the principles and purposes of KUFE expreesed in
operational form. It 1s considered and maintained as strictly core

fidentiel document, but 1t 19 of course available for examination by eny a

proper authority,

The policy manual 1s in strict conforuity with current American

national policies as evidenced by the following quotation fro.. Article oy

Oner

"ke a non-rovernsental radio station resporsible to
the millions of Arerican citisens who euppory it,

RFE cannot take a line contrary to Unitea Statea :
Government policy or to tne beliefs of tne Anerican a
people reflected in the Constitutio: of tie United

States and in American Institutions."s

wnich in any way violates the letter and ypirit of American policy and

Listeners that RFE and the cen who sake ity prograns are uncompromisingly

satellite countries,

RFE Policy Defined by land! (Direct Quotations)

1, The purpose of RF: is to contribute to the liberation of
the Nations imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain by sustainin; their
morale and estimating in thea a spirit of non-cooperation with the
Soviet-dominated regines by which they are, for the tice being, ruled.

2, The central characteristic of RFE is that it ig the ine
strunint f men who are engaped in fighting for freedom and justice.

As such, it encourages resistance to every tyrant, great and small, in
the countries it addresses, Itsmeakers speak == ao men of good will
whe seek to contribute to the elinination of old ennities and the
building of an enduring Eurepean decocratic order,

3. As a free forum in w.ich exiles speak to tueir own poeple
RFE is particularly dedicated to arguente by wiich exiles seex to
persuade their listeners of all devourix, ambitions of Soviet
Inperialisn, the cruelty and unworkability of Conmnist Institutions,

ene



and the proven advantages of the denwcratic way of life for the worker,
and the peasant, the adninistrator, and the business and professional

strata of society,
4, RFi. takes counvel with exile leaders and is reszectful

of their views, but ita policy 19 not designed to further the aspira~

tions of 8.y single exile leader or party.

5. RFE policy is further baed upon acceptance of the prin-
eiple that each of the liberated peoples shall be free to deternine

for itself the political and social institutions under which it will

live once it has been liberated, i
6. Finally, the following summary in the nature of a specific

Limitation on program content is quoted:

"Yt 4e Andispensable thit all concerned grasp clearly
that RFE is a multi-national station established to
contribute to the liberation of all the peoples it
addresses, and not rerely of one of those peoples,
RFE policy is therefore conmanded by the limitation
that nothing may be said over its facilities to one
national audience wrich will destroy the confidencs
in RF¢ of its other audiences or which 1s likely to
induce any of its audiences to prefer conmmnist rule
to a liberation which wight aprear to promise donina-
tion by a neishboring people,"

Dear Oliver: i

Wiicn I last saw you, I apoks of tho Gonoral
Hennyey matter explainin;; the creat importance that
tho Fund places on expediting the arrival of Gensral
Honryoy in this country for Fund purposes. I later \
mentioned this nattor in detail to one of your liaison |
associates who has those matters in hand. I explained.
that it is considered imperative that all possiuie as-
sistance be developed looking toward the sponsored ar-
rival of General Hennyey in the shortest poszibie time.

I now refer you io our letter of March 2, 1952, which I
delivered in person to Mr. Abramuon. That letter con-
tains all of the necessary data for action in the case.

We have just been informed that the unconscionable
delay in the processing and approval of General Hennyey's
entry presently will be made tho subject of public pro-
test by elements of the Mungarian National Council.

The dotails of this situation will be more fully explain-
ed by Leonard L. Stanm who will hand you this letter.
For your convenience, I am attaching a copy of our
letter of March 2 above cited, and I would furtner state
that wa believe that extraordinary action should be
taken to affect the imnediate processing of Genoral
Hennyey by entry permit or otherwise. Our reprezenta-
tives in Munich are in daily contact with General
Hennyey and ean be of particular agsistance in the event
you desire to use extraordinary means to expedite hia
departure for the United States.

| Dear Ur. Minetts

General usztav Hennyey is Representative of the Hungarian National
Council in Nestern Germany and a perscn {n whom ‘the Fund places trast snd
confidence in ity dealings with the problens of the ituncartan National
Council. The Fund has beon dosirora for sony time that General Hennyey
come to the United States, and believes that hia visit hore sould be most

helpfu. to the present activities and future of the Hungarian Nations)
Council. :

An opportunity presented itself last fall for General Hennyey to
emigrate to the United States as a displaced person. He was granted a
viea by the Consul Gonorai in Munich on Novemb-r 21, 1951, SC Number 2!
D.P. Commission Validation Numbor A-/037, Sponsor Mr. Louis Rado, 182 Kain
Street, Poughkeepsie, New York. Subsequent to the issuance of his visa
his file was sent by the local representative of the U. S. Immigration
and Naturalization Services in Munich to the Office of the Attorney den-
eral in Washington for special consideration under Noe 3-CFR-17557.
Noither General Hennyey nor the National Council have been able to deter-
mine why his case has been held in suspense, by the Immigration and Natu
‘alization Service. Indeed, in response to ono inquiry Genaral Hennyey

. was told that the filo in question had been lost. As stated above, the
Fund attaches great importance to General Hennyey's visit to the United
States, and considers this visit to be of high operaticnal importance,
since it will deeply affect the work of the Hungarian National Council.

We shail be very grateful for any assistance which you ean render in the
expedition of the decision of the Imuigration and Naturalisation Service.
I may add that General Hennyey's visa will expire on the 2ist of this
month, and he also will lose his rights cwing to the expiration of the
Displaced Persons Act in the near future should he not be able to enigrate

promptly.

Sincerely yours,

2. Admiral Miller reported that he had presented the

2. On 2 April, Admiral Miller stated that, work wap
absolutely worthless as far ae KCFE and K¥L were concerned.

linte2ligense reparte have been evaluated ag heving
practically no usefulness; and, as you knov, in hie intelligence
"gethering", ho has croceed eome_of Hs's vires. In both 070 and
OS0, there ia euch suspicion of that no one has bean willing
to give hin direct guidance for Tour thut it vould merely enlarge

knowledge of our operations.

3. whe! returns, my recommendation ie that we tell him
that walle we may discontime suport to the International Confederation
of Yree Trade Unionists in Exile, ve feel that, since we have a Paris
RCFE representative, we should use this channel—or somo other. channel
not involving additional expense.

4. Meanvhile, ance the ICFTU in exile 1s of prinary interest

Nr, Vinoiane called at his roquost to inforr us of tho high
lights of his recent trip to Durope, Ho hai firet attended the
peoting of the Eastern European Section of the Burerean Movement
in London, then vieited Franco, Gimany and Italy,

. Mey Virofam paid that in Gornany ho had talrad sith Chancellor
Adenauer, Secretary of Stato Halletein, and other offictala of the
Bonn Govornment, 3 voll ae vith Mr. Rober and other Al24od officials,
Ho said that the Germans vora rymyathetic to hia discuscion of
Iumanian affaire and shoved come intercrt in the ;roblene of Eastern
Europe. They, emphasized, hovever, thet Gormany's prvsent position
41d not enable ther to apeak in tonne of any positive rolloy at this
tine, Mr, Visolem got the inpruvsion that the Ge-mans vere now, and
would be in the future, even moro actively interested in Rimania~
ard other Eastern burspean countries than were France and Italye
Mr, Visolanu felt that F.anco had completely abdicated ite position
in Eastern Euroje and was ontiroly wrapped up in its om domostio
robles and relations vith Germany,

Mr, Vieoiam also discussed in Gurmany the cuestion of Rumanian
refugees there (most of thom aro Iron Guardists) ani of the rather
large comunity of Volxsdeutsche who came to Germany from Rumania et
the close of the war. lle said that the Gorman authorities vould
like to have this group returned to Rumania at such tine as the
country might be literatei, both buosuse they contrituted to Germany's
overepopuiation problem and because thoy would represent, as they
have in the past, & poosiblo instrument for German policy in Humanias
Aa e Rumanian, Mr. Vicolam was not over amcous to ali to the mmbers
of the German minority but folt that a free Funanian Goverment would
not deny the right of return to those who wished to do sa.

Hr. Vieolam talked at length vith Mr. Tyler in Saris. Ho
retains his distrust and dislixe of the CFE, which ke says can never
assist effectively in bringing about unity in the Ronanian enigration :
since it supports onc group 100% and persecutes the other group 100%.
Hs was particularly incensed about Mr, Berlo'’s recent intervention in
the Malexa case, Ho seid that he re;arded tho situation as having very
serious iz:-loatiore mot only for the emigree lut cleo for the future
of the country iteclf, He denounced kadescu's conduct, giving
mumerous exanples, as detrinental to the true intersst of Rmania, One
of his more specific cozplairts against the HCPL var the a;;ointzont
of Comarniaiu head tutor (or somo such title) at tho Free Lurope
Univeraity in Stra:bourg. He eaid that Comurniciu ha: no education
and no qualifications for the post but was there merely bessusc he we
of the Radesou fection which KCFE favored.

further reason for reluctence cn my part to attend this mesting 1s
that I have already passed on to the NCE people intorestcd all of
the ideas and information which I heve on the principal thene of this

diecussion. I therefore feel that,|

I would have nothing new to contribute. However, if Mr.
DIITéE Is unable to attend and you feel that I should gc, I would be
willing to do so.

3. Concerning your report of Prank Altachul's feeling of
grievance, I should be clad to signe letter to hin if Mr. Dulles
acreee that I aa the proper persen to do this, Pending Hr. Dulles!
ccreideration of this matter, will you please prepare in draft form

comment upon the fact that NCFE-RPE now represents one of the most
potent weapons in our entire areenal, and following with an acknowledge-

ale

ANTRODUCTORY HISTORY,

Formative Stage

Ab its Inception, the National Comittes for a Pros Europe
belteve! that its Iron Curtain brondoasting operation, Rudlo Free
Europa, could and should bo developed and pursued throwh tho mediun
of “National Councils" or "Comaittoos of Liberation" composed of
exile grosps from the target countries, It wus considered that

prominent exile leaders and porsonalities of each mstionality group

could express to their captive countrymen, entirely without American
advice acd guidanoo, the message of hops whieh NCFS proposed to sand,
This coscest waa not fulfilled, Bxparienco in attempting to weld 0

talented, dedicated group of exiles into @ non-partisan broadcasting

operation early dexonatrated that without Anorican control tre mission
of RFE would de lost in the junglo of exile-world politica, It soon
deoame evidunt thet the leadership among the exiles was neither suffi-

y strong nor personally willing to rise above the political cross

of

currents, factional rivalries, ant 6;linteregroup woaknosses characters

fatieatiy reminiscent of the political affairs of all Bistern Burozean

countrios,

Trose factors militated against the original plan of peraitting


exiles, through their lovsely organized Coucesls or Committees, to

wholly develop, manage, a4 control RZ broadcasting.

Since tho advert of KFE was the most important development
affecting tho oxiios which hid occurred sino thoir flight from hoze,
they quickly understood ond applauded its implications and potential
effect on their futures, Trough this {ustrument they could once
again become prominent and powerful in the effaire of the homolands

once more they could content for place and power.

Selection of personnel for the purpose.at hand quickly became

@ political football of rival leaders, perzonalities, and groups.
Rightists, Loftiste, Centriste, Labor Zlexents, and Splinter-groups
r political

argued with us for advancezent of their particular personal

views, Sponsorship of their ow adherents 63 RFE employees through whom

such views would be brosdcart to their captive countrymen became the

pattern of their pseudo covperation. This petvern was followed to such

an oxtent thet ordinary progress and seneizle development of our basic
purpose of truly free brosdcaste under oxile con'rol soon appeared to

be not only impracticable, but dangerous. For example, the National

Councils Division attempted to inaugurate troadcasts to Crechoslovakia

under the auspices of a Crechoslovak Netiorzsl Council. The Council was

and is mado up of exile persoralities of differing political views and
partios. Its factions preceeded to engage in endless disputes and ir-
recencilable olaims for ecatrol of seript preduction and program content.

arguing for the total indepentenco of Slovakia

Sovak “Sepomitiat



sought Shut objective, while Czechs desired opposite viows to be alrod
and adruceted the rebirth of pre-war Czvohoslovakia. Each group sponsured
and ineisted upon employment of its own more or leas qualified adherents
upon the sosumption that its special views would be thereby expressed

°

eaptive Czechoslovak audiexcy of RFE, Similar activities were

to

pursued by Hungarians, gulgarians, and Poles until the futility of per=
mitting the exile Counoila to control the destiny and broaduasting

policies of RFE was made clear beyond refutation, It became tragioally

ebvious thet uncontrolled exile-merld Counoiis and profyssional poli-

ticiass could not agree on personnel selection ot program content.

In aplte of every offort to induce harmony in and obtain proper

eocperation from tho “Counoils", "Committoes", and individuale, RFE was .

ley

sonfreated with an impasse, The alternative theory and present

of Averican selection of non-political exile personnel was the only way
out. It hes worked. Technically qualified personnel produse properly
oriented programe == and have beon doing sc with docunentod success

since July, 1960, Disappointed exile politicians, professional exile
caxp follomera, disturbed american special pleaders, and aleracd Gonmuntat

agents all scream, snipe and snivel == but RFE programs aro doing the Job.

NOFE-RFE records of this stago oan be supplied by Frederic R.

Deldeare, Vico-President, National Councils Division, and Robert E. Lang,

Director, FFE. The current policy has the complete endorsement of th

officers and of the Board of Directors of NCFE.



be

Development Stage

Upon the collapse of the original concept of broadcasting undor
exile auspices, RFE nocessurily utilized somo exile peraonnel endorsed
and recommended by the laders of the various nationality groups, As
tochniea) radio facilities camo into being, exiles with radio background
or writing talont werw required for tho production of programa. This .

involved uslng individuals eminently qualified by oxperience to do a

radio job of seript writing, announcing, acting, ete., without regard
for the fact that auch individuals might bo porgona non grata with one
or another polltieel fection or lesder of an exile "Council". It also
involved elimination of proven inefficient, inept or unworthy individuals
without regard for their exile "Council" sponsorship. in either instance

criticism of RFE was predictedle and indeed wus alwaya forthcoming -~

often in virulent and dishcnezt form.

Tho day to dey operstion of PFZ developed new techniques ang
long range plans which mide it impossible to euploy uon-entities of no

politiont color or conviction. Thu best poople to produce prograus in

harmony with NCFE-iPE purzosss ead policies neoessarily wore porsons
knom in their own countries for their view: on donestio political af
faire and their antieCommuaist activities. lard-hitting propaganda
required hardehitting personalities w.ose knoa: association with RPE
and its programs would add validity and significance for our captive

audiences, Gradually, therefore, the nationality desks of RFE at Kew

York and Munich wero staffed with tested, qualified exiles who had been


Adentifiod publicly with domestic politieal philosophies at issue in
their own countries. Many, in fuel, most of the staff people are con=
troversial Cigures among tieittuen countrymen in oxactly the samo ay
that prominent Americana are controvoraial in our political arena, wany
indeed are mombere of tha Cousciln, but are mon of auffiolent stature
to give their primary allegiance to ths non-partiaan poliey of RFE. The

“decisive factor is that tinrs be no controversy ur quostion about thelr

anti-Communiat convictions ead records.

At this point, 16 must be noted that our target countries have

bean aubjoot to repetitive political ferment prior to and following

World War II, as woll as the sucesssive occupations of Nazi and Communist
Armless.

The tempor of the times, therefore, in which these exiles have

lived for the past fifteen years has been one of excitement, bitternass,

recrimination, rivalries, aod personal turmoil = all stemming from both

nd foreign struggles for powar. The timas have produced a

domest ie
bumper crop of refugoo traitors, collaborators, and opportunists and at
the same time have developed pure Western style democrats, true national

patriots, and unselfis!: honsst men. Tho exile who stood by placidly

through the era ia not much good, huwevor talented, as a militant messen-
gor of hope via RFF; exiles who were honorably active in public affeirs

at home, and who had radio talent were, therefore, the only kind of

personnel auituble for RFE purposes.

As the necessity for American operational control of nationality

desks decane aolf-evident, the only feasible personnel policy ms to


§

t

employ proporly qualified individuals, regardlasa of exile politics.

In tho exvoution of this polley individuals who were useless were
eliminated without regard for political spoasors. This process still
goos on, Sixilarly, talentnd oxile personalities recruited from any
sourco wore employed whorover nooded. This procass still goes one

Both processes are in vogus with a healthy disregard for exile political
nuances and protests. Noltnur proceas is satisfactory to self-styled
exile leadors since it follows that the appointment of an individual
sponsored by one faction aa a represontative of its views, inevitably
will oyoke howls of rugy and eriticien from the opposite faction. This

ie an uccepted fact of exiles life. We have to live with it and got on

with the Job.

Ce Summary
Our formative and developmont experiences evolved the prosant
and continuing exile personnel policies of RZ. Exile desk employees,
whether at Now York or Munich, must respond to thres teste:
(a) Security cluarance,
(b) Endorsement of technical proficiency,

(ce) Sufficient stature to eliminate exile partisan
interwsts from progran content.

-Il-

CRITERIA AND UETHODS OF PERSON S2LECTION

A. Recruitment -- General Principles

Tho best source of exile personne! is referral by “non=

professional® exiles themselves, Anong @)1 nationalities there ore



Be

many talented refugees who need employment and who can supply RFS's
need for seript writers, actors, announcers, etc. Accordingly, desk
staffing has been accomplished by examining the qualiftvations of duly
reoozmonded individuals, whether the recomzendations come from political
personalities or otherwise. Solection 1s basud on tho abllity of the
individual to fill a need efficiently in turning out or participating
in planned programs. Recruitment Ls determined only by ideological
security, independence of oxile politics, and personal ability. This
is not to say that many individual exiles having decided personal con=
victions aud woll-knom political records are not employed, but a
positive statement is made that those exile employees who now produce

grams reflect the policies and guidance of RFE rather than pro-

motion of partisan objectives and personalities.

Recruitment -- Detailed Procedures

The personnel complement of each RFE nationality desk is

founded on a hard core of dependable individuals, usually two or three

including the chief of the desk, “Dependability” is established

Peo
by extaustive inguiry at all available sources to establish the desir-

ability, reliability, technical proficiency and security of the working

core of the desk. Sources used ares

(a) Exile political personalities in the United States,

(b) Exile references of high standing and known im-
partiality in the United States and Overseas,

(¢) Overseas contacts and personal knowledge of our
American representative in Europe. (Royall Tyler-Paris),

(4) Checks and balances of our political advisor at
Munich (W. E. Griffith),



a

(0) british Broadcasting Corporation, where applicable,
(£) Voice of America, where applicable,
= (g) Special confidential sources. ,
These tests having been applied, confidence is placed in these
initéel personalities, and particularly in the Desk Chief, to cafry
forward rocruitmont of additional personnel as wee in collaboration i
with the American Director of RFE (Robert E, Lang, New York ), and his :
associate officials. The leading personalities of oach desk know what
1a expected of them and since they respond to tho established oriteria,
tne resulting full personnel complement is a group of exiles who, not=
with standing their porsonal political viows, are suitable and eapadle
prograg production people. They mest our basic roquironent of daily
production of truly free and properly constructed propaganda broadcasts

capable of avaking the widest possible audience response in our target

countries.

In brief, the mission of RFE being conceived as a marketing
probles, the bast available salesmen are procured, trained, and utilized

to sell tho market.

©. kecruitnent -- Special Security Meusures

Since RFZ, although a private enterprise, is by extension a
collateral instrument of American national policy, special precaution
is exercised to insure the ideological security of all employees, in=

cluding exiles. In the case of exile personnel specifically, the



dD.

additional approval of tho Personnel Director of NCFE is required before
employment, either at New York or Munich. Thus, even if @ proposed

exile enployeo mevts all the described oriteria ho may not be employed

without this ultimate approval, “

The Personnel Dirostor of NCF# utilizes appropriate and de=
pondable sources of information to determine the accoptability of
porsonuel froma seaurity standpoint. His sources are investigative in

nature and are conclusive as to the ideological record and security

acceptability of the proposed eaployos, In doubtful casda the Personnel i

Director consults with the Vice-President in Charge of the National
Councils Division and with the Director of Radio Free Europe, These
three officers of NCFE jointly follow a policy of rejecting candidates
about whom there is the slightest doubt. It is to be clearly understood
that in making decisions of this kind the conflicting interests and

frantic representations of politically minded exile leaders and groups

are ignored. Acceptance or rejection of candidates is wholly based on

ideclogical security und talent value.

Summary
(1) ALL nationality desks of RFE at New York and Municn are
staffed by Andividuale who have passed all tests described above.
(2) All programs produced and aired by the nationality desks
are checked and scrutinized by American supervisory personnel for ideolog=
ical content, ee and conformity to basic NCFE-RFE policies.

The progrons atred by RFE are not left to whim or chunco, AlL

programs and tho pergonnel responsible for them are controlled by a

written poliey muual, Tho manual sets forth in minuto detat) the

position and policy of RFE on every topic beamed to our target countries.
The sanual ia the daily guidance of all employees, both American and
Exiles doviation from its rules ia not permitted. Continuous sorutiny
of nanuseripts and resultant broadeests is maintained by American om=

pleyoos to inaure that thero are no deviations.

Tho policy manual of RFE reprecente the considored views of
the responsible officials, ircluding the Board of Directors, of NCFE
It {2 @ etatoment of the principses end purposes of NCFE oxprossed in

operational form. It ts considered and maintained as a atrictly con

fidential document, but it 1s of course available for examination by any

proper authority,

Tho policy manual 1a in strict conformity with current american

nations] policies as evidenced by the following quotation from article
ones,

"AS a non-governmental radio staticn responsible te
tho millions of American cititers who support it,
RFE cannot take a line ccntrary to United States
Government policy or to tie beliefs of the Arerican
poople reflected in the Constitution of the United
States and in Arerican Institutions”.

The above quotation 10 undorsteod by exile porsonnel par=
tioulorly to be a sclemn inJunotion against tdoolegical program content ,
which in any way violetes tio letter and spirit of Amorican poliey and
ideale. It 46 4 guarantee to the American people and to our captive
Mateners thet RFE and tho men who make 1tn program: are unconprent sing}y!

opposed to tho Communist regimes now in power in Soviet Kuacia and the = |

sateliity countries,

RFE Policy Definod by tiundbook (Diroct Quotations)

Tho purposo of RFE is to contribute to the literation of

the Nations Azprisoned bohind tho Iron Curtain by sustaining their
morale and stimulating in them a apSrit of non-sooperation with the

Soviot-dominated regimes by which thoy are, for the timo being, ruled.

2, Tho central characterietic of RFE is that it 19 the in-
strumont of men who ure engaged in fighting for fraedom and justice.
As such, it oncourages resistance to every tyrant, groat and smll, in
the countries it addresses, [tu speakers speak s+. a0 man of good will
who seek to contribute to the elimination of old enmitios and the

building cf an enduring European democratic order.

3. As a freo forun in which exiles speak to their own people

RFE ie particularly dedicated to arguments by which exiles seek to
persuade their listeners of the all devouring ambitions of Soviet

Imperialism, the eruelty and unworkability of Communist Institutions

ene



| and the proven advanteges of the desocratio my of life for the worker,

the peasent, the administrater, and the business-and professional

strata of society.

4. RFE tékes counsel with exile leaders and is respectful

of their viows, but its policy 1s not designed to furthor the aspira=

tions of any aicglo oxile leader or party.

8. HFE policy 1s further based upon acceptance of the prin=
ciple that oach of the liberated pecples shall be froe to dotermine

for itself the polities) and social institutions under which it will

live once it hus been liberated.

4

6. Finally, the following sumrary in tho nature of a spocific

" Limitation on program content is quoted:

"It ie indispensable that all concerned grasp olearly
thet RFE ia @ multicrational station established to
contritute to the liveration of all the peoples it
addresses, and not rerely of one of those peoples.
RFE policy is therefore comanded by the Linitation
that nothing may be said over its facilities to one
national audience which will destroy the vonfidence
in RFE of its other audiences or which is likely to
induce any of its audiences to: prefer communist rule
toa literation which sight appear to promise domina-

tion by @ neighboring people.”

MEMORANDUM FORs SPC
SUBJECTS Leaflet Balloona for use in Paycholosical Warfare

1, On at least four occasions Mr. William Scripps, Detroit News,
directly or indirectly has approached the Goverunent with proposals for
utilization of ‘balloons for psychological warfare, Following is a list
of the dates and mothod of these approachoss

4. 12 October 1950 = Letter from General W. J. Donovan to DCI
enclosing "Operation Ballast.” On 1 Novenber 1950 William H, Jackeon
responded to this meniorandum to the effect that this suggested opera~
tion wae being referred to’ the appropriate persons and suggesting a
subsoquent meeting with Donovan to discuss this and other matters,

b. In Novonber 1950 as ve vere undertaking planning for devolop-
nent of balloons with General Mills, ve were informad that Mr. Scripps
planned a general moating to be held in Washington to discuss balloons,
Through the Genoral Mills Washington Representative Mr, Soripps was
persuaded to keep his meeting general and was inforcei that the various
agencies of tho Govornment had the matter under consideration and
considered that it would not be in the public interest at this tine
to disclose tho nature of their findings, Consequently, Mr. Scripps
forvarded us on 1 December 1950 a proposal "The Use of Free Balloons
for Load Carrying Purposes" which wo acknowledged on 11 December 1950.

¢. On December 26, 1950 General Smith reveived a letter from
Blair Moody sumarising a suggestion fron Mr. Willian Scripps for
encouraging defection of Chinese Communist troops, 4 routine response
to his letter waa sent 6 Jamary 1951 from Mr. Jackson, I believe
also Mr. Moody called upon the Director in early February of 1951 to
discuss use of balloons for psychological warfare. AIRC addressed a
briefing menorandum to DCI on 12 February 1951, Subjs Balloons for
Carrying PW Material to Soviet Areas,

2, In Septerbor 1950 the NPSB requested that Cla should represent all
interested agencies of this Government and should acooniingly take steps
to develop, procure and stockpile.an appropriate number of scientifically
designed balloons for future propaganda use in conditions of international
euergency, At mootinzs of the MPSB on 13 February 1951 and 12 June 1951
it vas agreed that OPC would procure and stockpile 1,000 large leaflet
balloons for use by the appropriate agaacy when ani if such use vas
euthorised, The Board also agreed that inquiries vhich the various govarn-

mental egencies

COR deA HAL



ae mental agencies might receive concerning use of balloons would be answered
: to the offect"that the mattor is under continuous study by agencios of the
Government but disclosure of results at this tine would not be in the public

interest.”

3. A perusal of tho NPSB minutes sinse June 1951 did not indicate
further consideration by that group of the subject of balloons. From this
we must infer that CIA still bears the responsibility of the commitment
made by Mr, Wisnor for procurement.

4. For your information this research and devolopment has been con=
with ONR

continied along with ONI'e program of come
ray research, Wp/obligated to ONR to deny a newspaper access to these
ravings, specifications, movies and reports which bear a SECRET elastficatdon.

i 5. I might make one omall suggestion that since Mr. Blair Hoody 10
now a Senator and running for re-election in the next election, 1t might be
possible to solicite his aid in bringing Mr, Scripps in lino vith adopted
policy regarding balloons should it becone necessary.

300 pounds great distances. On discussion, it appeared that ho was in

rane of 2350 a unit. Tais plece of ejulpaent under the expected wind con

seo us in two woers, ard tian vould discuss ané obtein oxhibite, It vas pointed

out to hin that tiis e;ulpnent and polyetiylere were well controlled by the

Scripps called again on 14 March, and asked 1f ve could attend 6 luncheon in
Dotroit Wednesday noon, the 2nd of April, end then go on to New York for a
luncheon Thursday nom. Me ened that ve bring along data, cost eatinates,

Dear Bobs

IT have not done much reporting on cur Gerven
negotiations for suveral reasons; first, there was not
Buch to report and, second, whatever there was Dick Condon
undertook to forward from tontene I did write C.D. @
couple of letters outlining our d@laya and soe of our un=
cartainties, and last week I cabled him thac J would send
eee erarnetaiioa narrative Wain Tigoe to Partie Aastia 16
now technically no longer President of NCFE, and az. Admiral
Miller may not have been completely inforaed of all thatw
are trying to do, Iam addressing this to you, with cory to

@ach of theme

™ the first place, let ma say that progress
during the lnst half of last week was surprisinily epeedy
and encouraging, Thete sre stil! ‘any opportunities for
the well known ®slip ttwixt the cup anc the lip", and local
Gertan political considerations coulc roar their ugly heads
at any wonent. J think it must alao be understood at, as
Dick Condon puts it, no natter now meny nor how good written
agroe-ents we may ‘have covering our opera tions, the whole
RPE enterprise in Gar-anyll have t= be played pretty much
by aay once the contractual agreuments take effects I rezurd
this, however, as an inescapable risk, and I ~extion it now
only to erphasize the parstount impertance of the ut-ost cara
in programming and {in ¢-ndivt to «vol.! a borer which could
upsat our entire apple-cart. The very ravorable repert which
your friend Asher Lee made wfter his hurried inspe tion of
funich underlines tne need for regular spot check on program
output to avoid howlers, and the neec for this once our
relationship with tne Ger.ens is nc loner through the Occu=
pation Authorities or HICOG is even core inperative.

Dick Condon s nt you from Munich the text of the
proposed Buncespost license which ve acrecd on with Dre
Schuster on Fo. rucry 19, 1952, and this should long since
have reached yous

Our Bonn ne otiations resulted in the accentance
of this text, with two exceptionss

1) sub-clzuse 2 of article JJ is oli~inated, You
Will rewccder that the Rundespost wishar to
insert a provision aut.crizing License cunce.lation if RPE
should troadeast anytring which @£t will te the opinion of
the Federal Governtent tiat t!.o transzisstons will prejudice



the interest of tio Fecurni hepuvlic®, We objected to this

on two grounisg
a) thot such provision had no logical place in
a technical license, ond

b) that 1t nods ar position far too precarious
since it exposed us to license cancellation
practically at the whim of any Gercsn bureaue

erat,

and we persuaded Pr, ychuster to lanve it out of the liconse
and let us discuss the preblem at Bonn. At Bonn, we vore
fortunately able to persuade the Foratin office officials
that auch a provision hed no tecknicel place In the license,
and trat whatever shoule be seid on tne subject should be
paid in an oxchan,e of latters, or the equivalent, batvcon
the Yoreizn Office and ourseives, Accordingly, Article IT

now contains but on: clausés

2) Question war reiaud by the Foreign office

ofricials at Bonn recarcine the largth of the
license. Thetext Dick sent you provides for validity until
August 31, 1960, The reason I choze tnat cate wes that it is
the expiration date of our lease on the Jolzxirchen transe
mitrer site, and I thought tat $f 45 arbitrary ters vere to
be fixen that tying it in with the flolzkirchen lease gave it
a ylaugisility whien would help accuptance = and that proved
to te the cas? so far a3 the Bundespost was concerned,

The Foreign Office people told us, however, that
nytersus suestions had been sexed in the Bundestag regarding
RYE anc its programs, enc that for tne Qovern-ent, to give us
a license for a3 long a3 eirht years would cause surtous
criticise, Ye are a peculisr sort of animal, anyway, and
for our irregular activities to ve vlessed with such long
tern ao;raval would, they thought, be unwise for buth their
and our zoints of view, Accordingly, they sus"-ated © foure
toe periods J counterod with: five, datin: from the date of

ieense issuance whien (since It canact take place before

the contractual asrounnnte becore erfective, may vell be late
fn 1952) will give us consideratly nore tran five years life
expectancy, My om feeling is that $2 we have not done our
jod within five years, we might ac woll pull down the shade
and go hom In any case, my counter proposal was, x2 ¥ said,
accepted, Article JIT of tne license wili now reads

ftnis license shall be valid for a period

of five years con encing with the este of
fits issuance ant ¥!il be automatically
extenied thereafter from year to year unless
written notice of te: inetion f9 given by
one psrty to the ot'er not less than 90 days
prior to the next expiration date,®



‘ \

So cuch for the license, tne terms of which were

shown to our HICOG frienda ana regarded by then as renee
favorables

Our political discussions suffered fro- 8 variety
of frustrations, We ssrecd on the licens: terms wit, the
Bundespost on Fobrusry 19th, and an azypointcent wee made for
us to sea Pre Lens = the oflici.1 to whom Poctor Adenauer
had referred our probleng = at neon on Thursday, February 21)
1952, Dick and I, tnerefors, tok an early train from
Frankfort and were net at the Bonn 8: jon by Fritz Kenpner
who told us that the aypointiant } cancolled as [r.
Lenz had d2-n called to the Chanca lery on an urgent watters
Fritz said that he had deen told that if ve wet to Dre
Lenzts office, hia assistant would make a definite npuointe

and non-co:-ittal incivicual, wio said he voul¢ not be in
touch with Dr. Lenz until nine otclock that evening, and could
not make any cerinite dato until after he hai spoxen with

Linte

I had the very uncomfortable feeling that ve were
baing given a run-around, and Fritz was very much annoyed.
We finally got tne young cKap to agree that he woule try to
reach Lenz before evening, and that we would tol* hone hin
during course of tro afternocn to know what infor-ation he
had been able to obtain. We telephoned rep atedly, but the
anawor was always the soe; "nothing repert®™, Dick and Ty
thererore, took tie train buck to Fr.n«fort, while Fritz
stayed in Bonn and, in tre evening, ha tels;honed thet he had

Draft : 29 Feb 1952

Hegorandua of underetanding between Hr. Phenix, representing
the NC7E sna Dr. » Yerresenting the Federal

German Fepudlis

AF, Phenix stated that the NCFE hea been founded in
1949 by @ group of private Auerican citizens animated by
the deaire to endouruge by positive measures the eventual
liberation from the oonaunist yoke of the peoples of the
enelaved countries. ef Central and Eastern Europe. He
oxplained that with the help of endowments and publis
sontritutions to the Cruesde for Preefiong the Comittee had
undertaken, among ite other activities, the operation through
Ra@io Pree Europe of radio broadcasting installations through
,Woieh 16 diseentnated to listcners in the Iron Curtain
countries prorracn especially prepared by the Gomit-:eo for
the furtherance of ite objentives, He pointed out thas
Radio Free Europe had conatructea and wag presently op=
erating tranenitrer etations at Holskirchen end Bibligy hed
ereated a large studio and offices building in Hunicsh und maine
tained a lerge uonitoring establishment ef Sehieissheim and
that ite prograne were prepared vith the help of lesiing
ocholers, Journalicts, administrators and eoonento experts
and men of letters whe have escaped fron the geomunist
@ontrol of their native land, cera

ur, Phenix explained that the ingtallation of RFE
faeilitiea in the United 8t..tea Zone ef Germany hd been
effected by the nerie the gocupation of that zone



2.

by the U.S. Army and that the operations of RFE had been, and
wore being facilitated by the U,8, Army authorities because of
FFE's etatus as an acoredited Anerican information

agency. He observed that the NCFE was concerned lest the
termination of the Osoupatien Statue would, in the absence
of specific agreenent with the Pederal German Republie, re=
sult 4n hagpering the work of RYE and impairing its effect
tvons: and that, with thé approval of the Departuent of
State, negociaticns had been carried on with the BPMin which
had resulted in agreement as to the terme of a lice! which
would be granted by the BPKkin to NCFE Annediately upon the

termination of the Ocoupation Statute. A copy of that license
ia appended hereto,

Hr. Phenix called attention te the fact that this license
dealt with the technical aspeste of RFE's radio broadcast
operations and that there vere several non-technical matcers
wich required clarification before the RCFE would feel
Justified in undertaking the long range program it has under

considerations
Dre stated that the objectives snd purposes

of NCVE, ia the realization of whieh RFE was enraged, vere
objectives and purposes to which the Pederal Government iteelf
was unalterably soaxitted, The negotiations for a BFKin

license had been oonducted with his full knowledge and appreval.
He was woll aware that by licensing RFE's operation in Mermany,
fully cognisant ef the objectives and purposes of that operations
the Federal Governsen® was on the enc hand eneeuraging the
expenditure by HCFE for that operation of large sume of aoney
eontraibuted by the Ancriocan public and on the other

was giving NCPE an aesurance that RFE's speration in Gernany
would not be interfered with, but on tho contrary would ve
fagilitated and helped by the Federal Goverment,

Frou hia viewpoint there was only one reservation he had
to make: RFE would be expected to refrain frou using ite brodde
oaet facilities on Gemien soil for the purpose of advocating
end promoting political enda whieh the Federal Oovernuent eon=
sidered in conflict with ite ewm basic policies, Hence, the
Federal Covernnent.would have the right, officially to aotify
NCFPE through the Foreign Office of any such conflict, Skould the
Gernan etations of HFE thereupen not refrain frow advocating
and prouoting the policies to which the Federal Gevornsent had
ebdjected, the Federal Government would have no choice out te
require the surrender by NCFE of its licenee and the diccontinuance
of ite orosdcast operations fron Osraan territory.

Ky, Phenix stated that he understood the reasons for oe
the views expreased by Dr. » accepted his reservation,
and agreed to the procedure outlined, snd that to provide a
factual basis for the consideration of any question which nicht
arise in reepect of RFE broadeasts the latter would keep on
file for a period of 30 days fro: the dste of use all tapes
recording progprass broadcart fron RYE transaittere in Gernany
eo that any quectioned program would be available to the appro=
priate German aut}.orities when requested by them. ur. Phenix
tren emphasized the inrertance attached by CFE to certain other
4eeata ef the cpercting pro>lens ef RFE, for exemplet

\


4e

(a) thet prenerty ef NCFE >rourht into Germany prior
to the termination ef the Occupation Statute be rocognised as
erally within Gernany ond cubjeat te the free disposition of
NOPE,

(b) that NCFE be recopnized ag & non=profi® orranization
of publig interest and that in respect of its operatione in
Germany it and ite owployees are entitled to no less favorable
treataent than any conparabld Geruan non-profit corporation er
entitye

(co) that the non-German personne) now Grployad by NCFE
in Germany be pernitted to remain in Germany hile a0 employed
and tha§ additional non=(lersan enpleyees be pemit ed to enter -
Cernany for ouch enploynent subjest only to the right of the
coupetent Germany authorities to deny entry te any indivi-ual © ‘i
whose presence in Germany vould in their epinion prejudice
German internal securitys

Dre. stated that he recernized the importance of

these eleaenta in the operation of RFE in Germany and that the
Pederal German Republie vouldcooperate with NCFE to the
fullest pessible extent in meeting ita requiremento with

respect thereto,
