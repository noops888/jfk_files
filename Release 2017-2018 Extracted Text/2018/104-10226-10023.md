MSMORANDUN FOR!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR POLICY COOFFINATION

- -SUBJECT:

NCE

do

For quito sone time the stall officere of this dividon concerned

with utillaine the l'acilities of the NC'& and with-oxyloiting the

Albandan, Bulgarian, and Rumanian enterations hare been eare of a laol

of adequate coordination batrean our

own activities and lose of the

NCFE ataif®

In conjunction with those Ml Division officers responsible

for handling our relations with that organigation, we have attempted

to esplore the problem in order to find a solution mich could be

conaldored realistle and practlead.

The difficulty lles not only in the communication system between

ope and NCrE, which does not alwaye tranait, it exactly the right ane,

the right ideas from one organisation to the proper individuals at the

right lovel n the other.

Althouch ve hars mintained very. close contact

both informally and through formal channels, only too often we have not

been in a poaltion to learn why NCE ataff officers have made a givon decia

Ion in regard to some enfere organisation in which we had an interests and

on the other hand, our denires and neoda have not always been fully under

stood or acceuted in New Tork. Again, 11 has happened that we were

Ignorant of dovelopments that clopoly affectod our operations until 1t

was too late for us to make or Influence felt, and, correspondingly,

• It must be admitted that ve have ourselves pushed ahead with courses of

action without adequately brieling the NCt.

The most extreme case in

point know to us concorna the fumanian enigration, where we and NCFE

are now pursuing condileting policies

the upshot

at this has been the

cradual development of a situation heroin OrC is sapporting an orgnise-

tlon, the NCbi, which 15' no: fully responsive to 1t.

This situation is not rogarded by ia as reflecting any fundamentad

Inadequacy in NCFs, or as jrasentine any insoluable difficulty.

There

onlots a problem in staff interrelationship which can and should bo

resolved by a reform in our organisational ap-roach.

The coal toward which

re belleve we should work is one where OrC communication with NClE would

be channolled directly alone a single high-level line which wold firaly

to in ADrC's office with thit of the head of the other organisation.

Ideas, mggestions, Information, etc.

would flow, in the regular channels,

up fron the OPc working level to Aric's office for revlew

TO COIGHESIAN O. KO ARMSTRONG.

I keonly regret to inform you that; upon further reflection and

upon the basio uf information which has recently

come to my attention,

I consider it in»dvisable for mito address your Paycholoiçal Stratern

Conference, and that I find 14 necessory to ask you to release no fro

apenking at your meeting on Saturday.

Then I was first asked to cocai

about the significance of l'ational Comittee for a Free Europe and tre

activities of kadio Free burope,

I understood that the Conference worla

discuss proporanda and peychological wartare.

I gente from the release

sagued by your o fice, that anoré tre purposes of the conference nre tie

presentation of definite plina of action to increase resistance noverte,

and to nid the peoples of the soviet nation and the Satellite States 4e

overthrow their régimes, as well as to eetablish a continuing orper1zation

to carry out, the programs developed at the conference.

This releaße also

indientes that there will be full and open discussion of such matters and

that persons purporting to represent underground movemente in Poland, tre

Baltic States, Russia, Chins, Koren, Eteo, will tike part in discussions.

It 19 my personal view that 1t would be unwise to di scuessmattere of.

this sensitive and provocative character in open meetingo, particularly

where programs of specific sction are considered.

It seeme

to ine that

public duscussiona of such mattere and revelntions of plans and prograes

wuuld not only expose and thus jeopardize the existince of any réleftance

norennts which may be identified and described, au well as the livee o?

the people perticipatines but would also provide quantities of advera

opaganda matcrial for uie by Soviet and satellite propajanda machines.

It 18 my conclusion that ry position and resporsibilitles as Chatran cl

the letional Committee for a free kurope make 1t inappropriate for me to

speak before or lend my name to such a gothering because of thr signitia

cance which night be attributed to such appearance. I want to express

THE "VOICE" AND RADIO FREE EUROPE

COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER

Buth Are Indispensable

"What's the difference berween the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe?" "Why

is it necessary to liave bush she Voice and Radio Free Europe?" These are frequent questions

asked of General Clay and the other leaders of she Crusade fur Freedom.

The Voice and Radio Free Europe are both vitally needed if we are to win she

Cold War.

They are completely separate organizations. Each performs a distiner function in she fight

against the gigantic Soviet propaganda machine.

The Voice speaks wish she authority of the U.S. Government. It is financed by Govern-

ment funds.

Radio Free Europe was ser up by private citizens. It is financed by millions of individual

contributions to the Crusade for Frecdom.

Voice is World Wide

I he Voice is a worldwide network, broadcasting in 46 languages over 79 sransmitters. !

s the only American voice heard in the Sovier Union. Is 120 individual daily programs o

news, music, roundtables, corrimentaries, documentaries, service programs, erc., have a porential

audience of 300,000,000 listeners.

ters are in Western Europe.

point of view.

Bur Voice is nor limited so Government pronouncements; is regularly reflects Americar

opinion as expressed in our press and radio. In a friendly way with programs of informa

sion and service it promores a berter understanding of the United Stares in Europe, in Latin

America, the Far East and the Near Ease.

2. Made progress in overcoming Soviet jamming.

3. Increased its broadcasts no behind the Iron Curtain, adding the "splinter" languages of

4. Inaugurared programs so Albania, Finland, Israel and Portugal in their respective languages;

to China in so additional dialerts, Swarow and Amoy; so Japan and South and Southease

Asia in Hindi, Urdu, Thai, Burmese and Malayan.

5. Became more outspoken and hard-hirting. One of the principal themes was the support of

the UN effort to repel the Chinese and North Korean Communise aggression in Korea.

Major attention was given to exposing the fraudulent Soviet "peace" drive.

6. Began work on the "Ring Plan" approved by Congress, which calls for a network nf power.

fron McCluny und oare in Incomfree,

thut 11 serris could be fourd to

do so, they be allored to use some of the R.".E. Iscilities in Germany

for cortein

of their uroudcasts. Since this batter was not brought up

as a formal request, so acrion was token by the comittee, but the in

dividual members untuouely expreced the opinion that this would be

most inadvisable and that they would be opposed to the use of R.f.F.

The other artier which come up for formal action involved the

This propram is considered a nuisance

By scheduling 15 and 30 minuto prorrans specifically beamed

to different serments of the population, such as: the womon's

progran, the church prortam, the farnerig prokran, book and

movie reviews, etco, Radio Pree burope reduces its listening

audience to those wno might be interested in tre specifio

program, while the majority oi the liateners are forced oither

to cease listenire, to their radios or change to another brozd

castiny station.

As a result, Radio free Durope has beon losing

Its audienco and the declino is especially noticeanle during

the prorran of Nors Briefs whon the majority of the listenors

allegedly change over to the BAC prograle

such tiews would be broadcast to their captive countrymen becare the

pattern of their pseudo cooperation. This pattern was followed to such

an extent that ordinary progress ard sensible developaent of our basio

many talented rofugoes who need employment and tho can supply RES's

need for soript welters, actors, announcers, ote. Accordingly, desk

staiting has boon accomplished by examining the quallf'uations of duly

recumendod individuals, whethor the reconmondations come fron polisical

personalities

or othorwise. Solection is basud on the ability of the

individual to fill a need efficlontly in turning out or partloipating

in planned

programs. Recruitment Is dotornined only by idoologieal

security, indopendance

of oxile politios, and personal ability. Inis

is not to say that many individual exiles having doolded personal con

victions and well-knom political

records are not employed, but a

positivo stutement is made that thoso axile employees who now produce

REE prograns raflect the policlos and guldande of RPE rather than pron

motion of partisan objectives and personalities.

B. Rocruitment - Detailed Procouures

The personnel complement of each RFE nationality dask is

founded on a hard core of dependable individuals, usually two or three

people, including the chief of the desk. "Dependability" is established

by excaustive inquiry at all available sources to establish the desir

ability, rollability, tochnical proficiancy and security of the working

cora o° the desk. Sources usad are:

To exile pollen are tending deed states,

references of high standing and lalown in-

Amerioan representative in Europe. (Royall Tyler-Paris).

(E) Spocial confidential sources.

Theso tests having been appliod, confidonce is placed in these

1o1tial personalitios, and particuiarly in the Dosk Chiaf, to carry

formard rucruitmont of additional personnel as nouded in collaboration

with the Amuricon Director of RF& (Robort E. Lang, New York), and his

associate officials. Tho leading porsonulitios of each desk know what

of them

and sinen they respond to the established oriteria,

the resulting full

personnel complement is a group of exiles who, not

#ith standing their porsonal politioal vions, are suitable and capablo

production of truly free and properly constructed propaganda broadcasts

capable of aunking the widest possible audience response in our target

countriese

In brief, the mission of RFE being conceived

as a markating

probler, the bast available salesmen are procured, trained, and utilised

to sall tho market.

5. Recruitment - Spacial Security Neusures

collateral instrument of American national policy, spedial precaution

1. On at loriat four oocasiona Mi. Willian Scrippa, Dotroit News,

diroctly or indirectly has approached the Govarment vith proposala for

utilization of balloone for psychological varfaro. Followiug is a liat

of tho daton and method of these approachess

do 12 October 1950 - Lotter from General We Je Donovan to DCI

enclosins "Operation Ballast."

On 1 November 1950 WIlian H. Jackson

responded to this memorandum to the effect that this suggostod opera

tion was bolog referred to the appropriate parsons and suggesting a

subsequent nooting with Donovan to discuss this and other matters.

In November 1950 an ve vere undertaking planning for develop.

mont of balloons with General Milla, we were Informed that Mr. Scrippa

planned à goneral moating to be hold in Washinzton to discuss balloona.

Through the Genoral Mills Washington Representative Mr. Soripps was

persuaded to keep his meeting general and was lafoned that the various

agencies of the Govornment had the matter under consideration and

considered that 1t would not be in the public interest at this time

to disclone tho nature of their findings, Coasequantly, Mr. Scrippa

forwarded us on 1 December 1950 a proposal "The Use of Froe Balloons

for Load Carrying Purposes" which we acknowlodged on Il December 1950.

co On December 26, 1950 General Smith roveived a letter from

Blair Hoody summarising & suggestion from Mr. Willian scrippa for

encouraging defection of Chinese Communist troops, A routine response

to his letter was aent 6 January 1951 from Mr. Jackso:, I belleve

also Mi. Moody called upon the Directo: In early Fabriary of 1951 to

discuss use of balloons for psychological varfare. ADFC addressed a

briefing memorandum to DCI on 12 February 1951, Subja Balloona for

Carrying PW Material to Sovlet Areas.

2. In Septembor 1950 the NPSB requested that Old should represent all

Interested ageneles of this Goverument and should accorilagly take steps

to develop, procure and atockpile nn appropriate number or scientifically

designed balloons for future propaganda use la contitloss of international

emergency, At metings of the IPSB on 13 February 1951 and 1l June 1951

1t was agreed that OPt vould procure and stockpile 1,000 largo learlot

balloons for use by the appropriate agency uben and 1f such use vas

authorised, The Board also agreed that Inguirion unied the varlous govern

3. A perusal of tho NPSB minutos sinse June 1751 d1d not Indicato

we must infer that CIA atill bears the responalbility of the commitmont

made by Mr. Wisnor for procurement.

contimed along with ONk's program of coumio

So I might mako one small suggestion that since Mr. Blair Hoody da
