In a report dated 21 December 1862 from a usually rellable

source, it was stated that the personal effects of Alfredo GARCLA

Almeyda, Second Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in Chile and

a suspected Cuban G-2 official, were aboard the Swedish ship,

Birgit Bengt Sjoster, when it sailed from Chile to Cuba on

14 December 1962.

Early in the morning on 25 March 1963 a local Santiago radio

broadcast announced that the Cuban Second Secretary, Alfredo

GARCIA Almeyda; had been declared persona non grata by the

Chilean government for misrepresenting himself to Chilean

authorities while trying to reach the site of a plane crash in

Peru.

This information was later confirmed by the Chilean

Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs who said that GARCIA told

the governor of Arica that he (GARCIA) was a Chilean journalist

and that he had forgotten his identification documents. GARCIA

was accompanied by the Chilean Communist Deputy, Luis VALENTE

Rossi, who vouched for GARClA's story.

VALENTE tried to

convince the Peruvian Border Authorities that he was a Brazilian

journalist.

The two were denied entry into Peru and thus did

not reach the site.

This information was taken from a document

dated 25 March 1963.

In another Document dated 25 March 1963 it was reported that

Alfredo GARCIA Almeyda, Second Secretary of the Cuban Embassy

in santiago, would leave by plane, Canadian Pacific, on 27 March
