WANTED ASSURE ME THAT: DOCUMENT IN QUESTION, WASNOT SECRETEL MIESLOY

INSTRUCTIONS TO REPUBLICAN YOUTHS.

HE SAID THAT NEITHER PRESIDENT

DI EMOR NHU HAVENEVER GIVEN SECRET INSTRUCTIONS TO REPUBLICAN

YOUTHS.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS THAT AFTER 16 JUNE ACCORDS

R SIGNED, COUNSELLOR NHU HAD ISSUED PROCESS VERBAL TO REPUBLICAN

YOUTHS, WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR PURPOSE OF RECEIVING CRITIQUE

ME OF GUNIS ACTION.

IT WAS, ACCORDING TO LUONG, NORMAL PROCEDURE

OSIVFOR POLITICAL PARTIES! TO ISSUE: PROCES VERBAL ON ANY ISSUE.

(COMMENT, REFERENCE TO REPUBLICAN YOUTH AS POLITICAL PARTY IS

INTERESTING) ACCORDING TO LUONG, THIS TS MEANS TO STIMULATE

.2b

PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THEY ARE PARTICIPATING IN AFFAIRS

OF THEIR NATION A LUONG HIMSELF SENT PROCES VERBAL TO ALL

98

MCCABE, WHO SENT WHOLE THING OVER PRESS WIRE. THIS UNFORTUNATE

AFFAIR

IS BEING QUITE MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE, TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT,

IT APPEARS THAT REPUBLICAN YOUTHS WERE BEING ASKED TO REVOLT

AGAINST. ACCORDS, THIS ALSO LUONG DENIED. ACCORDING TO: LUONG,

RESULT OF PROCES VERBALE TO REPUBLICAN YOUTHS REVEALED THAT RY

RPT RY WERE NOT IN ACCORD GVN. THE OUTSTANDING CRITICISM OF RY

WAS ASSURANCE THAT GUN WOULD CHANGE LAW NO. 10 BY CERTAIN DATE.

ACCORDING TO RY CRITIQUE OF GVN, INTERMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE HAD

NO RIGHT TO ASSURE BUDDHISTS OF

CHANGE OF LAW 10. LEGAL WAY TO CHANGE

LAW 10 IS BY LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE.: SINCE THERE IS SEPARATION

OF AUTHORITY IN GVN BETWEEN EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL

BRANCHES, INTERMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ASSUMED POWER OF LEGISLATIVE

WHICH, ACCORDING TO RY THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO DO.

LUONG INDICATED THAT MAIN BUDDHISTS: FEAR IS THAT RY WILL HOLD

COUNTER MANIFESTATIONS TO BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATIONS.

LUONG

ASSÜRED ME NHU HAD NO RPT NO INTENTION ÖF ALLOWING RY TO TAKE

ANY ACTION AGAINST GYN-BUDDHIST ACCORDS, BUT WAS ONLY PERMITTING

RETO CRITIQUE GYN, WHICH SLO

"DEMOCARTIC PROCESS"
