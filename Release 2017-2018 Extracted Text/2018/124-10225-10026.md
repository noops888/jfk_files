that the JURE and FUL agree that should one or the other, Cuban

or Haitian, governments fall, the other will consider the fight

for the other's independence as an "extension" of their fight

for liberation and lend all help possible to bring about the

overthrow of the existing dictatorship. U

SJ I-4 advised that the only Haitian group known

to be presently operating in Puerto Rico is the FUL which

Nas organized on August 2

• 1963.

The membership of this

organization at present consists of three persons, namely

GEORGES LACOMBE, FREDRICABESSON and RAYMOND CHAMPANA, all

Haitians residing in Puerto Rico®

BESSON and CHAMPANA have

not been active in the ful nor have they indicated they

desire to do so. u

SJ T-4 stated that there are approximately 70

Haitians residing in Puerto RiCo, Including men, womer

• and children. Of this 70 about 20 or 30 are students

attending school at

the Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, branch

of the University of Puerto Rico.

Because of

the limited

number of Haltians residing in Puerto Rico no group has

been successful in organizing an anti-Haitian group here.u

"Only a minority of the militia are with FIDEL.'

Eighty per cent are against the Red government of Cuba.

"Free Cuba will be the example as the leader

against fear and misery.

"In the past three months there have been more

gains made for the liberation than in the past three years.

"We are close to the Haitian revolutionaries

because whichever of the two democratic revolutions is

victorious - against FIDEL Or DUVALIER - they will continue

the struggle of their friend as though it were their own.

"The professional armed forces will be restored.

"We will protect and sponsor the freedom of

the professor and education.

"The militla and all

the extraordinary bodies

of repression will be abolished."

He stated there are nine

leaders In all which constitute
