CURRENT O3JECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

aie

DB inm rt ese oe

A. Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1. “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
- personnel and physical facilities," SCANTLING has continued (see pre-
vious Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-17999, 31
October 1961, HMMA~14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18
Nevember 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this ob-
-jective. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex-
tensively to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex-
cellent example of this blending of various Station support assets was the
investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both
LIENVOY and LIFEAT indicated the possibility of launching a successful
technical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIMERICK
intelligence officer assigned to Mexico under diplomatic cover, With the
aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed
by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station
support assets, were successful in installing a technical device in the
target.

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping
current records on the residences of the many Soviet persomel in Mexico
‘City. This is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of
all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters,
(See previous project renewal requests for additional details. )

2. “To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in-
terest operating in Mexico". SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-
formation on other Station targets:

a, On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in -
Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an
operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural
machinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transit.to Cuba. To
mount this operation, a precise and detailed casing of the imple-
ment was essential, This SCANTLING was able to accomplish in

one t ‘hat contribuzed subptarrigty-tey

b, SCANTLING provided the Station a detailed investigation
of Harotun ("Harry") KOPOIAN, employee of American Communists
Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which determined the residence
of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and connections.

c. In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of
an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected
Station technical operation,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances,"" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a. SCANTLING completed a detailed and secure interview of
the fiancee of BESMOOTH to determine her connection with the
principals in the MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection
with procurement of documents used in the flight behind the Iron
Curtain. This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING.
was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an
admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview.

b, SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work
in the BEXKNAVE/BECHICK operation. SCANTLING © gave his
usual competent performance despite the fact that the role assigned
him was unique to his experience.

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive
Station Soviet double agent which contributed significaprly to that
operation,

d, SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of
GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort in providing maximum
protection for the GPIDEAL party.

e....In addition, SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and
neighborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive,

SCANTLING zlso does most of the local investigations requested by
ODACID and other ODYOKE components.

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING
is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, For example,
SCANTLING handied.LIEMBROIL-2 until the recurn of LIMOTOR - i in July
1962, SCANTLING is aiso used to spot and rent safe house; ents
for other Station operations, QF

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be com-
pletely fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made
important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives
specifically and to other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time
and other intengible factors, unquestionably justifies his continuation
as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

B, Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic basé houses,"
Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective. This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for
Project Renewal, (HMMA-~-15979)

2. "To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objeccive.
Among LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographic assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have
never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party
Headquarters. During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover
the recent move of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had
of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site,

3. “To provide operational support to Station operations, i. e.,
rent hotel rooms and apart ments, and conduct counter-surveillances,"
GERENDE is used frequently to rent norel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely vaiuable Sation asset for such support activities. _GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.

4,. The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE s control
and supervision is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique. The i
Station concludes, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project |
should be continued, ;

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in previous project renewals, it can readily be noted that
Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in '
this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related |
Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive intelligence i
nor has it been interided that it should do so. The project's sole purpose I
is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information H
in support of other Station operations, i

Tl, CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the
past project year affecting either objectives or personnel.

I, EFFECTIVENESS
There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter
the validity of the remarks made in Section III of 1960 project renewal re- i
quest (HMMA 15979)

IV. PROBLEMS

which was described in 1960 renewal request, is still present but has

* caused no known difficulty, At Headquarters suggéstion in HMMW-9736, the
LICALLA base was reactivated on 29 May 1961, The. base operator con-
tinues to be alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the
base has been compromised, :

V. [PLANS ©

The Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum
size and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Efforts will
be continued to refine and better utilize the existing project organizational
arrangements. As ir the past, the Station will continue its efforts to
improve the comparimentation and secuyity of the project,

VI. COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended approximately $26, 250 during Fiscal Year 1962
(1 December i961 - 30 June 1962) and has thus far during Fiscal Year
1963 (through 30 September 1962) expended about $7,000.00, It is
anticipated that about $8,000.00 will be expended during the last two
months (October and November 1962) of the project year. This will
make a total expenditure during the project year: of about $43, 250, or
$6, 250,00 under the budget estimate of $49, 500.00,

B. Next Project Year - Of the total $49,900.00 budget, itemized below,
approximately $30, 400.00 should be expended during the remainder of
Fiscal Year 1963 and the balance, $19,500.00 should be expended during
Fiscal Year 1964, Normal accounting procedures will be used for all ex-
penditures,
