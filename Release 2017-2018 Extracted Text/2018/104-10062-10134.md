MEMORANDUN OF CONVERSATION

SUBJECT

Meeting with fial leniris, li May 1972.

1. Hal Hendris called my home on 10 May, baying that he war

in Washingion and wished to see me.

Arrangement & vere later made lo

mect hin in doratowa Washington at a street correi at 8:00 am on

1l May. I picked him up as scheduled, and after driving arouad awhile

we had breakfast at the Marriot Mich in Rosslyn, after which i drove

him lo the airport so he could catch the 10:30 a.m. plane to New York.

2. Isendrix had a number of points to convey, but nons of them.

were of such importance foi him to have made a trip to Washington

just to doc inc.

Therefore, his cuplunation seems plaucitic thet ho wan

in Washingion basically to see Jerry Homifin of the 2ima/Liic burcau

to discuss a lead on who might heve leated itt documents to Jack Andercou

Hendrix explained that he was recontly told by a "Caribbean ruffen"

named Enu Goodfriend that the person who furnished tic I'fi documento

to Jaci: Andercon was Irving Davidion, an ola fuend of Anucrion who cose

years ago had once set anide a dosk in his office for Anderion lo use on

occasion, Goodfriod said that the picture of Dite Beard with & nunber

of her Warhingion contacts published carly in the Il I scandal days had

included Davidson somewacre in the group, Davidson is deseribed as s

lobbyict for one or more Latin American Covernments as vell as for

Isrocl. Hannilin is considered a very knowledgcable and trusted friend

by Hendriz who wanted Hannifin's opinion whother Daridson might in

fact lie a acurce of Andereon's.

Ahmifin'o initial imprescion wes

that this wan a somato possibility, but he said he would chuck around and

try and talk to Davidson hirosoll to see wicher ho could get a rise on

the question of 11X, Henchis said he caine amay from the mocting withs

Hanvitin prolly well convinced that the load to Davidson as the sousce on

IT'l documento was probably not a gooil one.

3. Hendrix commented to mu that the genoral locling in Mi. X.

in that there may be two

pencirationo in the Wachingion office, to in

the N. J. office, and one in toir Clovelend office. Fe did not claborate.

k. Hendrix made the following comments about lne IT'T /Chile

documents:

A. He was aware that Raymond Brittenham, whom he

dorcribed as a senior Vicc Prosident and a bit of a fuddy duddy

who enjoys Farold Geneon's confidence, had first scen Jehr: McCone

and then como to Washingion recocily to talk with Agency representat

about the ITT/Chile documents, 'Ons proposal Let Brittenhan lar

thought of discusing with the Agoney was thee several sensitive

documento be turnod ovor to the Agchoy for enfekceping. Fe did

not seem to know whether this had actually been discussed hy

Brittentem with the Agency.

lendrix raid that Prittenzam had

diccuseod with the Agency what lix might gay in the Serate

roarings, whet the Agency might say, die. E. did noi acknowledge

having known tiat Drillerkom met with agcacy ssproconudires,

saying that this was presumably & 7ih floor matter.

He migat not

have bolioved ino, but i thought il bettor not lo confirin tes fact

to ling that & contact had in lack taken place cince he apparently

did not talk to brittenham himsell about this.

B.. Fnu Schoicr, the lowyer of the firm in Washiagion

retained by IT as counsol for the expected Senale hearings on

Chilean activities of It'T, has told III officials that he thinks

the timing and intensily of the Senate sub-commitics interest in

the Chilean activities of ifT will depend on the goneral political

situation in the U.S., particularly in Vict Nan2.

Schafer has boch

in touch with Pat folt, the eub-committee aide.

C. None of the IT T documonts oi: Chitc here been turnea

oves jet to the Senate sub-committee, The documente are still

being worked on by it't. Whon prescod as to the quantity involvod,

Jonizis noid the lotal is about 500 documents.

D. The theee documents liondris mentioned to me at or

last mecting as boing incriminating from the point of vior of

documenting ITT funds of political activities in Chile have not

been dentroyed. IIT's chief lawyer in N.X. has told Hendri:

that while away on a trip recently, at least four young lawyers

in his offico Icad these documento. He tried to transfer onc

of the lawyers out of his office, and the men thrcatened to blow

the whistle on IIT over there documonts it transicsied. Onc

of tho other four lawyers feels equally strongly about ibesc

documents. As a result, the documento connot be destroyed.

It io not clear, however, whether ITT plans to turn thess throc

documents over to the Senate. Evidentally ITT had first hoped

to turn these documents over to the Aguncy for safelicosing in

prcierence to turning them over to the Senate.

E. It has been dctermined by IIT lawyers that biocking

out propor names in docurnents before they tuin the documenis

over to the Senate sub-committee is perminsable. Thc ITT

lavyers are now going over all 500 documenia to do this, concentrat

on the names of Chileans.

If they finally turn over the three

sensitive documents to the committee, names of persons, barlis,

and @nding mecharisms will be deleted, but the basic purpose of

ITT funding Alessandri canno: be hidden.

Fi. In discussing these three documents, Hendrix said

that the man in N.Y. to whom lIT was to have paid the money for

Alessandri was (inu) Orchard, & Chilean employed by UN Secictoin

(rather than a membor of the Chilean Mission to the UN!. The comp:

through which the payments were to be made was the Lone Slar

Shipping Compasy, (This agrees with information in the files).

I noked whether the Swiss Bank account nuinber for other trans-

actions was also listed tucre, and Hendrix looked puzzled and said

that no Swise Bank account was involred. When I pressed and

naid my understanding ver that carlier he had told me money lo?

the Edwards group wout through a Swice account, he merely.

gaid there were no references to that in these three documenir,

He lion said one of the three documenis uns unfortunately a

moscage from Gerrity authorizing thes the Alessandri movement be

Eivon "half the sum recommended by liendris."

5. Hendrix spoke by telephone to Berroller on 8 or 10 May at

which time Berrellez reported on a meeting that day with EÜBRiC-2

in Bucnos nires.

This was the firot time that they had mei since their

carly April meeting in N.Y'. Berrellez toid FUBRIC-2 that he had not

been able to make the deposit on the secoud $100, 000 foi reasons Hendris

had explained earlier to me. (Eubria-? wes concerned by this and asked

that IT's do everything possible to resume these payments since he had .

money troubles. (Berrelles remerked, hoverer, dietEyPRIG-? seemed

in very good spiris poisonally, and quito optimistic about the chances

of the opposition in Chile). Hendrix plans to reopen tht question of resuming

paymonts to the Edwards

people in Chile when he gets back to N.x. and

Bees Gerrity.

6. The U.S, manager of the ITT telephone manufacturing plant

in Chile slippod up to the States a few dayo ago and oported that he

thought the government would be moving in on the lt't property very

sOOn.

He lad already been authorized by the company to send his

furniture up. ITT is alco aoking Benjamin ITolmes to come up to the

U. 5. foi a visit. I reinarked that my recollection was that Holmes

was on rather good porsonal contact with President Salvador Allende,

and Jose Toja, but Hendrix cominented that even Holmes was now under

suspicion by the Government of Chile.

7. Hondrix heard yesterday from Bob Deach (phonetic) of the

Scripps Howard office in Washington that Ambassador Edward Korry had

left his position at OPIC and is now the president of a book sellar's

association according to a press item which appeared within the last

two wecks. Hendrix was unaware of this and asked whether I knew

anything about it which I said I did not.

8. No had a rather intercating explaration of the by-play in

Chile on turning the ITT nationalisation question over to the Congrers to

decide.

Bcareller reports that there has boen a delay in Allende's

proponal that Congress handle the ITT nationalization because of

disagrooment on how to procced, The fear of some hard-liners was

that the

sovernment was not being tough chough on ITt. Allende's intent

apparcully is to make a proposal that the Congress would be forced to

rejoct Miereby giving the Prosidoni e chance io call à plebiscite on ihe

issue wich, being aboutlIt, he could not possibly lose. An interestiny

thour!:.

?. The daughteï of Hendrix is engaged to Lewis ('TO")

Constontine, who is applying for a job with the agency. lic las passed

certain crams and was to have an interview in Weshington on ll way

followed by a physical exem shortly afterwards. A hitch has developed

in that he was origirelly cossidered for some sort of a job in the photo-

graphic fiuld, but he has been told the job has now boen filled by sorneone

who returned to the job so thai inctoad he is being offered a 2-3 year

contract, probably to go lo laos, De is not sare o1 the careci apportinity

a contract status would give him, and is torn beireen this situation and

some offer now boing made by IRS. He has long ranied a job with the

Asenov. (Hendrix claimed that Constantine in not aware that bis fiancoo

Bondria made a big point of thic.) I said it

would be possible to check what the situation was and to find out what the

agency's intentions wore toward this porson, but tiat i coald not adoci

in zny way the decision of hiring, or unêce what conditions. Hendrin

was cardial at all tines not to ant for spocial treatment, but faller ho

esperosed a sligh decree of concarn as to the apparent change in job

• offers. I replied that as for as I waa awers, any person who was hirod

on a contrici basie who proved himseli to be of exceptionally lich

-

capability could end up as a career employee with ua, but it world deperá

on omployraght ceilings, etc. at the time such a switch was actively

considered.

to ceemed satistied with this answer. I acid Inould checi

and let his know if there were any unsual circumstances in this case.

My improssion is that Hendrix is not overly fond of this follow, but

respecis him and would noi try to, interfere on his bohole either way..
