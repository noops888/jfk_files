1, Hal Hendrix called my home on 10 May, saying that he wan
in Washington and wished to see me, Arrangements were laler made to
mect him in downtown Washington at a street corzer at 0:00 am on
UMay. I picked him up as scheduled, and after driving a 34 awhile
we had breakfast at the Marriot Metcl in Rosslys, after which I drove
him to the airport so he could catch the 10:36 a.m. plane to New York,

2. Bendrix had a nuraber of points

ptiviite m basically to see Jerry Wannifin

fo discuss a lead on who might heve leaked iTT gocurnents to Jack Andere

Hendrix ex Saints that he was recently told by a "Caribbean ruffian"
named Fnu Goodfriend that the person who furnished the LT‘ documents
to Jack Anderson was Irving Davidson, an old £
years. ago had once set aside a desk in his office for Anderson to use on
occasion, Goodfricnd said that the picture of Dita Beard with a number
of hex Washington contacts publighed carly in the TILT scandal days hed
included Davidson somewhere in the group, Davidson is described as a
lobbyict for one or more Jatin American Governments as well as for
Isracl. Mannifin is considered a very knowledgeeble and trusted friend
by Hendrix who wanted Hannifin's opin whether Davidson might in

fact he a scerce of Anderson's, Hannifin's initial impression wes

that this was a remote possibility, but he said he would check around and
try and talk to Davidson himself to sce whether he could peta rise on

the question of JIT. Hendyix said he came away from th
5 St pretty well convince t the lead to Davidson

B. Fnu Schafer, the lawyer of the firm in Washington
xetained by ITT as counsci for the expected Sevate hear
Ghilean activities of L1YT, has told ITT officizls i he thinks
the timing and intensity of the Senate sub-committee intercst in
the Chilean activities of 1fT will depend on the general political
gituation in the U.S., particularly in Viet Nam. Schafer has beak

BD. The three documents Hicndrix mentioned ta me at our
last mecting as boing incriminating from the point of viovr of
documenting ITT funds of political activities in Chile have not
been destroyed, ITT's chief lawyer in N.Y. has told Hend.
that while away ona trip recently, at least four young lewyers
in his office read these documents. He tried to transfer onc
of the lawyers out of his office, and the man threatened to blow
the whistle on ITT over these documents if transferred, One
of tho other four lawyers feels equally strongly about these
documents, Asa result, the documents cannot be destroyed.

It is not clear, however, whether ITT plans to turn thes. three
documents over to the Senate, Evidentally ITT had firsthaped  -
to turn these documents over to the Agency for safe

eping in

preference to turning them over to the Senate.

E. It has been determined by ITT lawyers that biacking

out proper names in docurnents before they turn the documents

over to the Senate sub-committee is vermissable. ‘ihe ITT Rees
lawyers are now going over aii 500 documenta to do ihis, cancentrai

on the names of Chileans, Uf they finally turn over the three

sensitive documents to the committes, names of persona, tanks,

and Qnding mechanisms will be deleted, but the basic purpose af

ITY funding Alessandri cannot be hidden.

: ¥. In discussing these three documents, Hendrix said
that thé man in N.Y. te whom IIT was to have psid the money for
Alessandri was (Inu) Orchard, a Chilean employed by UN Seerctaria
(eather than a member of the Chilean Mission to the UN}. The comp:
through which the payments were to be made was the Lone ©
Shipping Company. (This agrees with information in the files).

IT acked whether the Swiss Bauk account number for other trans-
actions was also listed there, and Hendrix looked puzzled and said
that no Swiss Bank ount was involved. WhenI pressed and
paid ray understanding wes that earlier he had told me money for
the Edwards group went through a Swiss account, he merely
said there were no references to that in these three documents,
He then said one of the three documents was unfortunately a
rnescage from Gerrity authorizing thet the Ale movement
given “half the sum recommended by tiendrix,"' -



5. Hendrix spoke by telephone to Berrellez cn 9 or 10 Xiay at
which time Berrellez reported on a meeting that day with Foae bess 2
in Bucnos Aires, This was the first time that they had met since their
early April meeting in N.Y. Berrellez told FUBRIG-2 that he had not
been able to make the deposit on the second $100,060 fc
had explained earlier to me

reasons Hendrix
RIG-2 was concerned by this and asked
that IT £ do everything possible to resume these payments since he had
money troubles, (Berrelicz rernerked, howe $5 EQERIG-2 seemed
in very good spirts parsonally, and quite optimistic about the chances

of the opposition in Chile). Hendrix plans to reopen the question of resum:
payments to the Edwards people in Chile when he péts back to N.Y. and
sees Gerrity,

6, The U.S. manager of the ITT telephone manufacturing plant
in Chile slipped up to the States a few days ago and reported that hi
thought the government would be moving in on the ITT property very
soon, He had already been a zed by the company to send his’
furniture up, IT‘) is also asking Benjam’ ol the
U.S, for a visit. I remarked thet my recollection was that Holmes
was on rather good personal contact with President Saivador ANende,
and Jose Toja, but Hendrix commented that even Eoirnes was now under
suspicicn by the Government of Chile,

7. Woendrix heard yesterday from Bob Deach (phonetic) ef the
Scripps Howard office in Washington that Ambassador Edward Korry had
left his position at OPIC and is now the president of a beok seller's
associztion according to a press item which appeared
two weeks. Hendrix was unaware of this and asked w!
anything ebout it which I said I did not.

8 We had a rather interesting explanation of the by-play in
Chile on turning the ITT nationalization question over to the Congress to
decide, WKerrellez reports that there has been a delay in Allende's
proposal that Congress handle the ITT nationmalizatien because of
disagreement on how to procced, The fear of some hard-liners was
that the ,overnment was not being tough enough on ITT, Allende's intent
apparently is to make a proposal that the Congress would be forced to
