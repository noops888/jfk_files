MEXICAN AUTHORITIES HAVE INFORMED US THAT THE NICARAGUANg

ALVRADO, AFTER A LONG INTERROGATION, HAS CONFESSED IN A SIGNED:

STATEMENT HE DID NOT SEE OSWALD IN THE CUBAN CONSULATE HERE ON

SEPTEMBER 18 OR AT ANY OTHER TIME AND THAT HE DID NOT SEE ANYONE

PASS MONEY TO OSWALD ALVARADO SAID HIS MOTIVE FOR CLAIMING

ITHE PASSAGE OF MONEY TO OSWALD WAS TO INVOLVE THE UNITED STATES

IN A WAY WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE OVERTHROW OF CASTRO

OCTV THE LEGAL ATTACKE AND THENCASTREPRESENTATIVE BELIEVE THAT

ALVARADO'S STATEMENT TO THE MEXICANS MUST BE ACCEPTED AS

FACT• THIS OPINION IS CONCURRED IN BY NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL

WHO PERSONALLY(S)

WAS STANDING BY ADVISING WITH THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES DURING

THE LATTER PART OF THE INTERROGATION WE ARE THEREFORE PROCEEDING

HERE ON THE THEORY THAT THE ALVARADO STORY ABOUT HAVING SEEN

MONEY PASS MUST BE COMPLETELY DISCOUNTED•

OFTER COOPERATION, I DOUBT TOES WILL MAKE ANY INTENSIVE ENTORT
