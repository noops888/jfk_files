C/LA/ST/B

Shep: Re HSCA request 6 July 78 (OLC 78-2491)

Para 3: We have no record of any transcripts or recordings of conversations of Jac

Whitten or Win Scott. If any exist should be in CI Staff.

Para 4: Annie Goodpasture wrote a history of the Mexico Station for the Western He

sphere Division not the White House. This history covers the period from the incepti

of the Station in to 1969. There is very little material dealing with the Kenne

assassination but a great deal of material relating to Liaison, relations with top"

officiald and operations not related to the HSCA investigation. It is impossible to

itize this tome and the "soft file" documents do not exist. There is a bibliography

again precious little pertains.

Where to now?
