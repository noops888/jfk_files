The following information, based upon statements
reportedly made by Dominick Edward Bartone at various times
in the past, was received by the Department of Justice from
a confidential source who has furnished reliable information
in the past:

In regard to money invested by Bartone in Niagara
Crushed Stone (Humberstone) Ltd. (NCS) in 1959, Bartone
advised that he had the money in a French bank in Panama
and wrote a check for it in Canada, so that the money went
from one foreign country to another without going through
the United States. In regard to money borrowed from Public
Bank for use in connection with the operation of the NCS
quarry, Bartone stated this was bank money and not Union
money. He also expressed the belief that Public Bank
borrowed money from the Central States Teamsters organization
at a low interest rate and then lent it out to Bartone and
others at a higher rate. Bartone stated, however, that he
was not certain about a lot of this information, but he had
found out various things and then had “figured from there".

Bartone stated that when he was called before the
Federal Grand Jury at Detroit in September, 1963, he "took
the Fifth" because he did not want to get into trouble with

the "racketeers". Bartone was apprehensive that he might be
asked how he had got. to Joseph F. Verhelle, former President
of Public Bank, and why Verhelle had given him the loan.
Bartone did not want to get involved in saying that James
Hoffa told Verhelle to give the loan. Bartone said, however,

that Verhelle was "BE with the’ “racketeers",
Referring t is" and William
Yeggceser, partone stated he had let it” be" known that they
ad'a twenty-five per cent interest in the NCS quarry but

yr ae actually did not. Bartone said they had: probably
f

received favors from James Hoffa but they did not "come up
with the scratch". Bartone stated he, himself, had never
been involved in any "payoffs" with Hoffa. After, Bartone
had additional financial problems with NCS, he reportedly
had a discussion with Hoffa during which Bartone became
angry and “exposed his people" in front of Hoffa but Hoffa
did not do anything about it. Hoffa subsequently told
Bartone that it looked like Bartone had a "bad deal" and
not to blame Hoffa but to blame “your people". Hoffa said
they did not know how to count up to-a million, let alone
borrow a million, and they did not know how to do business.
Hoffa indicated Bartone should have come directly to. Hoffa
rather than going through them, and Bartone said he did not
cut corners and it was through them that he had met Hoffa.

Bartone indicated that in 1961 when he was trying
to obtain new financing for NCS and was having a survey made
JpWeissne ineers, Inc I), Verhelle either would not- :

reléase the nécéssary information or else gave Bartone and
MEI incorrect figures. Verhelle finally gave some papers to
MEI after an official of the Continental Bank in Chicago

(with which Verhelle was formerly associated) had been
requested to contact Verhelle concerning the matter. Following
the MEI survey there was a proposal that Salk, Ward and Salk
provide additional financing but they did not do so because
they .knew Verhelle and he promised he was going to let some-
body else buy it and they would "get a piece", according to
Bartone. Bartone expressed the opinion that Salk, Ward and

.

WAS

DocId:32309334 Page 4



Salk were "crooks"; that if they lent money they wound up
with a piece of it; and they would try to get forty or

fifty per cent of a deal if they knew the borrower was in
a disadvantageous position.

Bartone said that Alvin A, iman had led: WEbe

government agencies to believe that’ Bartone had no
authority to try to get additional financing for NCS,
establish letters of credit, etc.; but Bartone had made
records available to show that he had such authority
through Powers of Attorney and other documents giving
him.the right to go out to seek private financing through
zlliopfyaneusy, MEI, Salk, Ward and Salk, or any other
ource'Bartone wanted to use.

Bartone said that the present owners of the NCS
quarry are going broke on the operation and want to give
it back to Bartone "on a platter“. Bartone said the quarry
had only been producing about 300,000 tons a year and nobody
will do business with them; that Bartone had "knocked them
out" of about 700,000 tons; that after Alvin Naiman had
lost. the sales and distribution business for NCS in the
Cleveland area, it was given to a former Naiman associate
(probably named Barricelli) who used to haul for Sandusky
Crushed Stone; that there had been a shortage in payments;
and “they ought to do business with us this year''.

In regard to $50,000.00 which had been posted

with bankruptcy officials in Canada in connection with an
attempt to regain control of NCS in 1961, Bartone advised

that the money was sent back and Bartone gave.$25,000.00 .
to the Metropolitan Bank for the benefit of Don Ross and hh. SIE 5
others, and Bartone used the other $25,000.00 fo: Janefield

Village and other interests of Bartone. He referred to
‘Janefiera Village as potentially a 2 3/4 million dollar
Florida real estate development in which he has over
$100,000.00 and has a twenty-five per cent interest. Two
brothers and the widow of the original owner have the’

other seventy-five per cent. Bartone said he has been
working on it over a year and a half and recently has been

SRE.

borrow money to’ buy out his partners and finance improve~
ment of the property, which is about 1; miles west of
Cypress Gardens. Bartone indicated that Advance Mortgage
was going to put up the development money and Bartone may
have a quarter million dollars “preliminary money". Bartone
said that in regard to this matter he was staying away

from Hoffa and that if Bartone's present plans work out
Bartone would not need assistance from Hoffa or others.

Bartone also advised that he recently was
involved in borrowing $155,000.00 in connection with a
frozen food plant in Miami and also is involved in a
$125,000.00 deal through which equipment would be pur-
chased possibly for an oil field development in Guatemala.
He indicated he is involved with a bonding company and has
a partner by the name of Wysockie (phonetic) who may have
some racketeer connections.  Bartone indicated that he has
people who can go to a bank and get loans on their signatures
provided Bartone can post a guaranteed bond for them.
Through this means, it cost Bartone $23,000.00 to borrow
$175,000.00. He advised that he had supplied some property
as collateral so that Wysockie could write a $100,000.00
bond and that Bartone had been selling a few lots for
expense money to get around. :

In early 1961 Bartone claimed he owned the Playboy
Club franchise in Mexico City, Mexico, and in the summer of
1961 he said that he had or could get 10,000 Ml rifles. He
recently indicated he has banking conections at “the oyal
Bank of Canada. in Nassau and has an interest in thex'British

al Savi and Loan''_in Nassau, in which he

100,000 ‘shares n the stock was a dollar a share. This
savings and loan organization had made mortgage loans of
over $100,000.00, had reinvested about $25,000.00 savings
deposits, and kept its money in the/Royal Bank of Canada at

a good rate of interest. Sehgmn Lktude

Bartone allegedly travels only at night and by
automobile. He has recently been a anied on some of. 74
his business trips by Nicholas Wisk Morris. Morris =
reportedly resides in Miami with hisj cher and has a
sister who is employed by the State Department and is Fé
married to gregory Gahles, aM: When Bartone
was in Chicago al “1961, he and some of his associates,
particularly Morris, were believed to be carrying guns.

Also about that time Bartone reportedly. stated that he

was connected with Hoffa and got a new Cadillac every year.
Bartone subsequently claimed to have “told off" Hoffa and
to have fallen into disfavor. When in Chicago in the past,

Bartone reportedly was in contact with Barney Baker, Joe
Glimco and Tony Accardo,. :

Bartone was associated with Don Ross at one time
in the ownership of a catering business, now defunct; and
in 1962 Bartone allegedly owed $67,000.00 to Ross. Ross l
reportedly was "started out" in Chicago by Dave Yaras;
operated an automobile dealership and had other business
interests in the Chicago area; and recently had something
to do with a juke box enterprise in California.

Baxrtone once said that bes been some Wi bby
"shenanigans" between P. D.¥Maktos and Pete: ayton "<7"
regarding promising, or getti legal fees, to get Union
loans for people. Bartone was skeptical about individuals
who claim they can get a loan from Hoffa. According to
Bartone, the Central States committee recommends whatever 4
Hoffa recommends and it has to be a "good legitimate deal" | '
- but Hoffa makes the decision. : |
