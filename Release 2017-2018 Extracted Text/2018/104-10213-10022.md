upon receipt of AIRGRAM no. 1301, dated 31 October 1959, from the
United States Embassy in Moscow, in w! h it was stated that

OSWALD had appeared at the Embassy on 51 October to renounce his
American citizenship. He stated that he had applied in Moscow
for Soviet citizenship after his arrival in the Soviet Union on
15 October. The first public reference to OSWALD appeared in the
Washington Post of 1 Novenber 1959.

On 2 November 1959, the FBI liaison officer requestedya ...
cTA's
trace be run on Lee Harvey OSWALD in the sqgeepes central hold- |
T
ings. Gg response on 4 November was negative.
Because of the counterintelligence implications of
OSWALD's action, the Counter Intelligence Staff opened an offi-

cial file on Lee Harvey OSWALD to accommodate biographic infor-

mation developed by the Agency in response to a Department of
State inquiry, dated 25 October 1960, on a list of american “de-
fectors in Soviet Bloc countries. OSWALD's name was one 16 Of those] ”
appearing on the list. CIA forwarded an interim reply on 3
November 1960; a final reply on 21 Novenber 1960. Until early
October 1963, the contents of the OSWALD file held by CIA consis-
ted entirely of press clippings and “reports disseminated by the”

assured.

b. 27 September. Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN
received a confirmation from the Soviet Enbassy that the 5
American had been to the USSR installation. He had shown
them a letter from the Soviet Consulate in Washington indi-!
cating that he had been long awaiting a visa for himself
and his wife to go to the USSR. No answer had come from ;
Washington; however, the waiting period was sometimes four
or five months. The American also had a letter attesting -
that he was a member of a pro-Cuban organization but he had

claimed that the Cubans would not give him a visa unless he

had already received a Russian visa. - eke Beste
Although the American was still at the Cuban Consulate;
Silvia DURAN repeated that she could not give himaa transit!
visa unless a Soviet visa was forthcoming, notwithstanding
the American's wish to go to Cuba to wait there for his
Soviet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one
in Cuba and she intended to make an appropriate annotation

c. 28 September. Silvia DURAN was again visited at

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City by the American seeking a —

Cuban transit visa. Mrs. DURAN contacted at least two ‘Rea-j.

Speaking in poor Russian, the American ‘stated that he “alrsué

address then, and he had gone to the Cuban Embassy to ask
