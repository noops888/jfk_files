the reasens fer the interregatex(|') conduct and ranner and the true purpose

ef the phase itself,

: only vith “certain personal matters." The interregation of HOSEUKO aleng — -—

has beon ef rene values but, even if this 4s se, I cannet seo it from a

: review of his reports. These reperts all contain basic errers arising from |
the psychelogist!'s lack of knoulédge of Soviet meality ani ho lack of

i experience with the trus nature ef Soviet man. The psychelegist is net

prepared to prezerly deal with ani evaluate NOSEKKO because NOSENAO 4s i

all of this, a highly trained intelligence agent.

ef NOSENKO's type. This becomes mere and rere ebvious te me as I heartims the
Ppsychkolegist say, "Well, he is probably telling the truth,” when o& I have
seen clearly that MOSEN:O hac been lying. There have been rany such cases in
this Mi latest phase of the interrogation.
5e As @ result of such instances — instances of "seft Anterregation,"

where KOSENXO's ebvious lies hive nst been challenged — maser can new enly

renenber that ROSENKO came te us prepared enly fer complete success er
failures he expected that in the case of failure he would be subjected te

finds himself in the peculiar position of having PSI2ENSADOnNN4EsseOM outuardly
failed in his prinsry assignment, yet being faitby vell treated ani alleved te
contime with his lies and dezinferratsiya despite his detention, He can now
only be thinking that there still is sene hope for hin and for his mission, ©

remenber these things vhen ke can remenber being held acress his father's knees?

42. The psychelegist’s repert includes and assessment ef HOSEMKO's rethert

“TEN: ” AEDONGR. Interrogation Transcripts

1, Submitted herewith, as requested, are AEDIPPER/20's verbatin
‘transcripts (15; English-language) of his interrogation of AEDONOR,
26 July=13 August 1955; the first five (5) of these transcripts, are
accompanied by the corresponding verbatin Russian-language transcripts |

(Russian-language transecripta for Reels #s 6 and 7 are ready for

typing, 1f required); an index to the names mentioned in all of the

transcripts also is submitted. Further, the original Englishelanguage
transcripts (15), with corrections, are being returned to Headquarters
with this meno; the fifteen (15) corresponding tape recordings already

have been returned.

2, With regard to the remainder of the original Headquarters
request, it has been agreed that AEDIPPER/20's transcripts are sel?- i
explanatory at most points and that hia background comments on the
course and content of the interrogation will be reserved, to be
addressed to any future specific questions and requirements generated

in Headquarters review of those transcripts.

unfounded statements for any reason in any of the interrogation |

of Headquarters* request == that AEDIFPER/20 did not use faise or ‘-
sessions; it is believed possible that ideas to the contrary may |
have arisen during review of-the original transcripts, which included {
many instances of inproper interpretation of the Russian "double
negative", Reviewing the “{nterrogation, AEDIPPER/20 noted only tvo (2)

points at which he did not have a basis in detailed personal knowledge

(to 1954) or specific documents for statements made to ANCCHOR:
