5. Mr. Helms’ 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the tiarren Commission on
the de Mohrenschiidts is attached at C. It describes the Agency's
interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now
Domestic Coliection Division - DCB) had its resident agent in Dallas,
Nr. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. The ~
history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt from 1957
to 1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr.’ Moore requested
traces on Nr. de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached at D) con-
tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive
contact with the de Mohrenschildts. (An'OS summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt.
prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

6. Our files show that’ a mail cover was ‘placed on letters addressed
to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to
1966. - (This was probably not uncovered.at the time of the external in- *
vestigations.) . This included opening and photographing the contents of
some letters by the CIA Station; there. The results of this operation
were shared with the FBI. ;

7. Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during
the Rockefeller Commission investigations. : We were asked to respond to a
memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA
Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for
an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and
asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de
Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is
attached at E. ;

8. The most recent information .we.have on Mr. de. Mohrenschildt comes
from Mr..J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers
connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press‘and the Dell
Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and
Mr. de Mohrenschildt.~ Mr. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached
at F.

Conclusions: fad

9. Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous and
colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman. He “is both well

a -2-

SECRET

and poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have
raised serious questions. Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this
Agency and the FBI to spend more time, and energy on him in the past

than was necessary.

10. Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their
interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's: activities by the mid-to-late
1960's. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could
either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-
tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination
of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond
Nr. Moore's reports attached at F. What we can say’is that we have
found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active
interest in Mr..de Mohrenschildt in recent years.

Dear George: oy os

Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.
It took time to explore thoroughly the matters you raised. a

Let me say first that I know it must have been ‘difficult For y you
to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I
can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic.
death a few years ago and the.current poor state of your wife's health.
I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. £

In your situation, I can well imagine how the attentions you
described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my
staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your
activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. ° The
flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren
Commission has Tong since subsided... I can only speculate that you
may have become "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest
‘in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may be attracting the atten-
tion of people in the media. ‘

I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George, :
although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.
Thank you for your good wishes on my new job. As you can imagine,
I'm finding it interesting and challenging.

Very truly yours, =. -

George DE MOHRENSCHILDT

From the Office of Security

CIA CONNECTION:

DE MOHRENSCHILDT was security disapproved for OSS employ-
ment on 18 July 1942 because he was suspected of being a Nazi

‘agent. On 13'August 1958 derogatory information was furnished

the Contact Office who was interested in interrogating him as
an alien contact. His second wife, Phyllis whom he married on
11 July 1948.and divorced 29 December 1949, was employed as a
receptionist by a covert project (NCFE) from 1950 to 12 January
1951 when her employment was terminated. . (Reason not _Biven. J,

Subject's brother, Dimitri S. VON MOHRENSCHILDT, was
approved on 11 April 1950 for exploitation as-a contact for
foreign intelligence purposes on a limited basis; not to receive
classified information above confidential. af

OS INDICES: RESULTS:

OS Files on Subject, his second wife, and his brother
reflect use by the Agency as set out above. Subject was =
investigated by the FBI in 1941, 1942,.1945, 1947 and 1957.
Between 1940 and 1942 Subject was considered to be pro-German
and suspected of being a German propagandist and an espionage
agent. Several informants stated that Subject was in sympathy ~
with the Communist form of government in Russia but knew of ~
no un-American activities on the part of Subject.. One infor-
mant advised in 1947 that Subject had definite Communistic ~~!
tendencies. However, investigations failed to produce any
legal competent evidence or witnesses to:substantiate the
reports that Subject had been pro-Communist or pro-Nazi. The
majority of informants consider Subject to-be eccentric,
irresponsible, conceited, an adventurer fond of exaggeration
and overly aggressive. He has been known to associate with
persons of questionable loyalty, reputation and moral character.
Subject has admitted that he tends to exaggerate and stated
that he thought the Communist form of government of Soviet
Russia was the better form of government on the European



continent; that he had a great admiration for the Communist
form of government but that this admiration. did not prevent him
from having a stronger feeling of loyalty to the government of
the United States.

A New York Times item for 12 December 1966 mentioned that
George DE NOHRENSCHILDT has been acquainted with Jacqueline
KENNEDY'’s father,’ John BOUVIER, and mother, Mrs. Hugh AUCHIN~
CLOSS, since Mrs. KENNEDY was a girl. The DE MOHRENSCHILDT's
were quoted as saying they were perhaps the only persons in?
the world to have known the families of both President. KENNEDY
and OSWALD. Pawo

Was J. Walton Moore connected with CIA? Was he connected

with the Oswald case?

Answer:

Mr. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division
office in Dallas during the early 1960's. Wis only ae
with the Oswald ‘case prior to the assassination is recorded in
his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact :
Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed veréion of the document

is also attached because.of the poor legibility of the

original). He may have been involved in the Agency's effort to

support the Warren Commission during the Commission's investi-—

gations. Mx. Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr..

de Mohrenschildt for advice concerning Oswald. ‘We find

indication that there was ever any contact between Oswald and

- Mr. Moore.

Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by —
my house. We advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy
assassination and. that he understood I was a friend bf George ~.
detohrenschildt. He wanted to know if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald.
or if detohrenschildt. had ever suggested that I should see Oswald.

I told him no on both counts and advised that.I have not seen ar
talked with George deHohrenschitdt since the fall. of 1961. é

2. Nr. Russell attempted to draw me into discussion of the es
Kennedy assassination which I avoided and wanted to know if I could ©
give him the name of the chief of the CIA office in Mexico City in -

“7963. 1 told him I could.not, and-he said he could probably get the

name from tr. David Phillips. I do. not foresee any adverse publicity
as a result oF Hr. Russe}l's visit but felt that it should be Led are.
matter of record. ~ c
