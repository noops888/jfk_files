Mr. George de Mohrenschildt

Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter to you,

dated 5 September 1976

Action Required:

None:

This memorandum is for your information.

We have also

attached at A a suggested draft reply to Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter.

Action Taken:

We have reviewed DDO and IG files on Mr. de Mohrenschildt:

In

addition, at our request,

the CI Staff has run Agency traces on him and

has been in touch with the FBI as well.

Findings:

There.is voluminous material.on Mr..de. Mohrenschildt in CIA

files, most of it dating from the post-Kennedy assassination period

when he testified before the Warren. Commission on his acquaintance

with Mr. and Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald.

(A copy of the de Mohrenschildis'

testimony is attached at B.)

The bulk of the material in our files consists of FBi reports,

the most recent of which is dated 1967. The FBI has informed CIA that

it has no traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt beyond that date; our files

contain all of its previous material on him.

Mr. Helms! 3 June 1964 memorandum for the liarren Commission on

the de Mohrenschildts is attached at C.

It describes the Agency's

interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a

result of his sojourn in

Domestic Coliection Division - DCD) had its resident agent in Dallas,

Mir. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschildt at that time.

history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt from 1957

to 1961 is also attached at C.

As a routine matter, Mr.: Moore requested

traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt.

The trace results (attached at D) con-

tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive

contact with the de Mohrenschildts.

(An OS summary on Mr.

de Mohrenschildt

prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

6.

Our files show that a mail cover was placed on letters addressed

to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to

1966:

(This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-

vestigations.): This included opening and photographing the contents of

some letters

by the CIA Station there. The results of this operation

were shared with the FBI.

Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during

the Rockefeller Commission investigations. We were asked to respond to a

memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA

Activities

and the Warren Commission Investigation.".

an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and

asked what Mr. Moore knew about. Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de

Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission

attached at E.

The most recent information we have.on Mr. de Mohrenschildt comes

from Mr. J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers

connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell

Publishing Company.

Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and

Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mr. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached

Conclusions:

de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous and

colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman. He is both well

and poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have

raiseá serious questions.

Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this

Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy on him in the past

than was necessary.

10.

Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their

interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late

1960's.

We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-

tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination

of President Kennedy.

We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond

Mr. Moore's reports attached at F.

What we can say is that we have

found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.

Dear George:

Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th Tetter.

It took time to explore thoroughly the matters you raised.

Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you

to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter.

I believe I

can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic

death a few years ago and the current poor state of your wife's

health.

I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances.

In your situation, I can well imagine how the attentions you

described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my

staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your

activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. * The

flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren

Commission has long since subsided. I can only speculate that you

may have becone "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest

in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may be attracting the atten-

tion of people in the media.

I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George,

although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.

Thank you for your good wishes on my new job.

As you can imagine,

I'm finding it interesting and challenging.

Very truly yours,

George Bush

Subject was investigated by Federal Agencies in 1941, 1942,

1915, 1947, and 1957.

The investigation reports as well as the

files of other Federal Agencies reflect the following:

Between 1940 and 1942 Subject was considered to be

pro-German and suspected of being a terman propagandist and

an espionage agente

Several informants staied that Subject was in sympatby

with the Commnist form of government in Russia but knew of no

un-Amsrican activities on the part of Subject. One informant

advised in 1947 that Subject had definite Commnistic tenden-

cies.

Investigations failed to produce any legal competent

evidence or witnesses to substantiate the reports that Subject

had been pro-Cormunist or pro-Nazi..

Majority of informants consider Subject to be eccentric,

irresponsible; conceited, an adventurer fond of exaggeration, and

overly aggressive.

Subject has been known to associate with persons of

questionable loyalty, reputation; and moral character.

Jubject, when intervieved, admitted that he tends to exag

gerate and advised that he thought the Communist form of govern-

ment of fioviet Russia was the better form of governmart on the

European continent, and that he had a great admiration for the

Conmnistic form of government,

but that that did not prevent

him fron having a stronger feeling of loyalty to the government

CIA CONNECTION:

DE MOHRENSCHILDT was security disapproved for OSS employ-

ment on 18 July 1942 because he was suspected of being a Nazi

On 13 August 1958 derogatory information was furnished

the Contact Office who was interested in interrogating him as

an alien contact.

His second wife, Phyllis whom he married on

11 July 1948.and divorced 29 December 1949, was employed as a

• receptionist by a covert project (NCFE) from 1950 to 12 January

1951 when her employment was terminated.

(Reason not given.)

Subject's brother, Dimitri S. VON MOHRENSCHILDT, was

approved on 11 April 1950 for exploitation

as a contact. for

foreign intelligence purposes on a limited basis; not

to receive

classified information above confidential.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

OS Files on Subject, his second wife, and his brother

reflect use by the Agency as set out above.

Subject was

investigated by the FBI in 1941, 1942, 1945, 1947 and 1957.

Between 1940 and 1942 Subject was considered to be pro-German

and

suspected of being a German propagandist and an espionage

agent.

Several informants stated that Subject was in sympathy

with the Communist form of government in Russia but knew of

no un-American activities on the part of Subject.: One infor-

mant advised in 1947 that Subject had definite Communistic

tendencies. However, investigations failed to produce any

legal competent evidence or witnesses to substantiate the

reports that Subject had been pro-Communist or pro-Nazi..

from having a stronger feeling of loyalty to the government of

Was J. Walton Moore connected with CIA?. Was he connected

with the Oswald case?

Answer:

Mr. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division

office in Dallas during the early 1960's. His only contact:

with the Oswald case prior to the assassination is recorded in

his 1 May 1964 memorandun to the Acting Chief, Contact

Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed version of the document

is also attäched because of the poor legibility of che

original). He may have been involved in the Agency's effort to

support the Warren Commission during the Commission's investi-

gations.

Mr. Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr.

de Mohrenschildt for advice concerning Oswald.

we find no

indication that there was

ever any contact between Oswald and

• Mr: Moore.

Pussell of Dial Press, Concerning Dallas Fiel

6-82-71

1. On the evening of 13 July 1976, at about 21C0, Mr. Richard

Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by

my house.

He advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy

assassination and that he understood I was a friend of George

defionrenschilde. He wanted to know if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald

or if devohrenschildt. had ever suggested that I should see Oswald.

I told him no on both counts and advised that. I have not seen or

talked with George deflohrenschildt since the fall of 1961.

2.

Mr. Russell attempted to draw me into discussion of the

Kennedy assassination which I avoided and wanted to know if I could

give him the name of the chief of the CIA office in Mexico City in

•1963. I told him I could. not, and he said he could probably get the

name from tir. David Phillips.

I do not foresee any adverse publicity

as a result of fir. Russell's visit but felt that it should be made a

matter of record.
