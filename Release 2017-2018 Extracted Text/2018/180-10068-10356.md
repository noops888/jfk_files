AGENCY FILE NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 13

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 8

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Howard M. Gilbert has been in my employ since August 18, 1975.

He was specifically hired to participate in an investigation

and prosecution relating to fraud and theft in the operation

of the State's Workmen's Compensation Division.

The subjects

of the investigation included administrators and employees within

the division, private attorneys representing claimants with

alleged industrial injuries, and doctors providing questionable

medical reports in support of claims against the division.

Mr. Gilbert spearheaded a Grand Jury investigation into these

matters which resulted in the return of several indictments

against private attorneys and the administrator of the division.

Mr. Gilbert has just completed the prosecution of former attorney

L. R. Bretz in what is reported to be the longest jury trial

in the history of Montana, spanning a period of nearly eight

Bretz was convicted of 18 felony counts involving thefts

from clients and the Workmen's Compensation Division.

During the period of his employment I observed Mr! Gilbert to

be one of the hardest working attorneys I have ever encountered.

He was uniformly the first attorney in the office in the morning

and worked nights and weekends whenever necessary. I found

his briefs and memoranda to be well written and supported by

sound legal research and logic.

I am most pleased to unreservedly recommend Mr. Gilbert as an

outstanding trial attorney and one whose loyality was unswerving

in the face of continuous political attacks on the investigation.

I feel he would be an excellent addition to any legal staff,

and he will always have my warmest appreciation and personal

respect both as a lawyer and as a gentleman.

very truly yours,

ROBERT I. WOODAHL

Zetorney General
