FROM Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT : AMCLEVE/15_-- IDEN A IRD @72501

201-300983

BACKGROUND: - es

aar-old PBRUMEN male who has been of continuing
since Initlal:contact with JMWAVE and more recently
with the] ‘Station as a penetraticn of the IDEN B organization.

PURPOSE/PROCEDURE:

Subject was SGSWIRLed at the sequest of the| Station because
of several {saues which tended to question Subject's bona fides, possible
affiliation with PBRUMEN intelligence through relatives, unreported associ-
ation with gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM, plus other itemo specified
in questions Msted below. The interview was conducted in the home of

~Ceear C. KALBING id both English aad Spanish. (Subject's English is quite

good, however, curing actual testing Spanish was used to avoid ambiguity or
misunderstanding of the question content.) KALBING did the tranelating.

RESULTS:

Subject remains sensitive to one question which ts related to his past
dealings with IDEN C but in fairness to Subject this sensitivity is believed
gesexated by genuine uncertainity over the amount of items which be had
boen instrumental in getting for IDEN C. Sensitivity initially recorded in
other areas was resclved through post-test discussion and responses to all
other questions are regarded as substantially truthful. Subject was most
cooperative and candid throughout the entire interview.

DETAILS:

Because of the numerous issues which were believed in need of clarifi-
cation, a three phase test was structured pricr to the interview and rehearsed
with Subject completely before any tosting took place, Discussions, as noted,
wero in both English and Spanish. Specific cuestions asked of Subject and
anawers given by him are as followe:

SECRET :
CS-copy A = Zoo 9a sm

IRD #72501

Have you used any name besides IDEN A? Answer: No, except
for alcknames and aliases used with WOFIRM.

Have you ever travelled to Wa) ington, D.C. Answer: Yes.
_ Ouce several years ago.

Have you ever been to the Soviet Union? Answer: No.

_Are‘any of your ‘yelatives membere of the Communtet Party?
After some discussion Subject felt it probable that they were.
. Those specifically mentioned were his two brothers IDEN D
7 asd IDEN:E and also possibly a sister named IDEN F who ie
also in PBRUMEN and married to a Captain in the Militia,
When the questicn was prefaced with the words: ‘Je it your
- belief that any of your relatives arc members," Subject’s
ways yes. He based this belief on the fact that
both brothers hold highly responsible positions in key industries
in PBRUMEN acd hence must be members. He also noted that
prior-to bis leaving PBRUMEN, he (Subject) and his two brothers
had many discussions about politics and their views differed
from Subject's, As for his brother IDEN E, Subject regarded
* Bim aa the brain’ in the family and originally 4 very religious
person who alended Catholic services dally. He later evinced
distrust for the clergy in PBRUMEN and Llamed them for the
downfall of the church, When Castro made bis move, IDEN E
was in completé sympathy with him and remained with him
despite hi Ithough
IDEN E never acknowledged that he had been a Communist and
would usually retort with a comment that be (IDEN E) was a
“humanist. "

Are any of your relatives working for PBRUMEN Intelligence?
His answer waa that be felt that at least one of them was accord-
ing to what KALBING inferred during his discussion with Subject
the day before the SCSWIRL test. This was his brother IDEN D,
but be-also wondered about his brother IDEN E who might also be

ia with PBRUMEN intelligence because according to what his mother

mentioned in a letter eume time ago, IDEN E had been in the
USSR receiving traiuing of some sort. This training lacted for
8 full year and occurred in 1962 to the bost of Subject’s memory,
Subject was reascnably sure of thio date because of the “Atlesile
and President Kennedy's death whith occurred later.

After this discussion the questicn read: "Is it probably that
your relatives (brothers) are working fcr PBRUMEN intelll-

gence? Answer: Yes."

suspicions.

Besides the letters we asked you to send to your brothore lave
you comnivatcated with anyone in PBRUMEN? Answer: Yeo.
His mother’ t two or three times a year and-with an aunt
named IDEN H which wae the person to whom he actually

the letter to bis brother which WOFIRM asked him

addr e

to write, | This letter inc} was posted in 1967 (a fow

H months before coming to and not 1966 as noted in

i Station files. Since arrival Subject has written
bis mother only once and had the letter posted from Miami to

. prevent anyone knowing his exact whereabouts. (In addition

to these contacts, Subject has sent one telegram to his mother
soon after the IDEN I just to let her know he was alright.) It
wae about this time that IDEN E wrote to him and criticized

his participation in IDEN I.

: Have you seen either of your brothers since 19617 Subject answered
no, Last saw IDEN E at the airport in the distance but there

were employees from IDEN E's place of employment present
and IDEN E was apparently reluctant to go near the plane. Since
1961 Subject has not seen any member of bis family and as time
goes on dues not miss them as much, The persons he claims to
have been closest to were his aunt and grandmother and addre:
comments to them personally when he does write to his mother,
When further discussing his ‘brothers cn this question, Subject
wae somewhat complimentary despite their differing political
views and generally considered them ao hard-working energetic

types with good achool records,

Do you have a secret means of contacting anyone in PBRUMEN?
| Clains he knows of friends who have used telegraras to transmit

coded messages but he has never engaged in such activity. These
mescagee were directed against the PBRUMEN. :

IRD #72501

> Have you ever been in Communist China? Answer: No.

Have you over worked for the intelligence service of any country
besides IDEN J and LNHARP? Answer: No.

Have you ever received intelligence training in PBRUMEN?
-Anawert No.

Have you over beon.a member of any Commeaist guerrilla group?
“Answer: No. Later explained sensitivity to the question as
.@manating from errreat work with two former Communist
guerrillas named IDEN K and IDEN L beth cf whom are new

with IDEN B.

Have yea told anyone in PBRUMEN thet you are working with
WOFIRM? Answer: No. This question led to discussion
of broadcaste from PBRUMEN which identified Subject as a
member of WOFIRM, - These broadcasts occurred in Octcber
1967 according to Subjéct andthe man fingering him was
IDEN M. The latter was not officially in Subject’s WOFIRM
grcup before his capture in PBRUMEK hence Subject does not
know why it was that-ho was specifically named. When it was
later suggested that this announcement would probably have
ecme effect on bie family, Subject said be just didn't know
what effect it wculd have and has heard cf none. He agreed
that it was quite ironic that one side of the family was working
with an intelligonce service which was diametrically opposed
to the side to which another member of the same family was
affiltated and in fact becouse of his present IDEN B employment
he was actually in the business of hunting them down. Subject
agreed that it was indeed ironic but felt his convictions differed
from his brothers’ and that was that.

Have you told anyone tn IDEN N that you are working for WOFIRM?
2 Noted that come knew of his past affiliatica hence the questioa
was qualified to mean bis present affiliation, Later after
reactions were recorded, Subject noted that hie wife is fully
witting of his WOFIRM employment aa is IDEN O. He also
raeationed that s PBRUMEN type. IDEN P, whom ac knows
from childhood has been kidding him constantly i:

that he ig still with WOFIRM until Sabject finally told him fa.
an offhand way,.'Sare I'm with WOFIRM, “ but he does not
know what effect this had on IDEN P or whether he haa told
anyone of tis -suapictons of Subject's WOFIKM Involvement.
‘He specifically denied that anyone uther than these three
persons were knowledgeable,

Does anyone in IDEN B know you have this meeting with us today?
Anawer: No.”

Haive you ever bean asked to perform any task or mission agalast |
the LNHARP? Answer: No.

Have you ever performed any task or mission on behalf of IDEN G?
Anower: No.

Has-anyone told.or instructed you on what to report to us? Answers
No.

Have you had contact with IDEN C since 1967? Answer: No. Cone
tinued reactions to this question which necessitated a break-
down test to isolate the rescon for his sensitivity to the topic.
He repeatedly dented that he had had any contact with IDEN C
since the IDEN Q told him not to but acknowledged a physical
revulsion to the mention of the man’s naine, and a long dis-
cussion enaved regarding the extent of Subjects involvement
with sthe man. Subject contended that the contact began quite
innocently in 1965 and’ was what Subject initially thought was a
doliberate provocation to see what Subjects reaction would be.
Subject immediately reported the contact to JMWAVE handlers
who guided him through continued ccntacts and instructions from
IDEN Q. Subject was instructed to sell IDEN C “silencers” (guns
with silencers attached--about aix or seven to the vest of his
recollection) in order fo find out his true identity. Subject fur~
aished physical descriptions and license numbers to JMWAVE
and continued to report on contact with IDEN C. He offered
Subject $500 US which JMWAVE told Subject to keep since it was
merely a bonus given him for his work as an intermediary.
IDEN C continued to force contact with Subject and once came
te his homo in shorts and made veiled threats which were
answered with counter threats of violence from Subject, and an
outright threat that Subject would kill IDEN C if he threatened

him again, In 1967 while with the IDEN R, Subject gavo
i IDEN C somo'"pencils' to keep him away which Subject did
wot ihen report to WOFIRM but later did. He gave him about
Es 122 altogethor. Subject had promised IDEN C some $00 pounds
: _ 9fC/4 oxplesives, M-2's, sub-machine guns, etc. but all waa
3 intended to bait-IDEN C for arrest and none wae over supplied
zt tohim, Later Subject noted after reacting to a break-down
question that‘he had supplied him with pencila, silonce:
| ‘also some,grenades and pentolite. But theve he claime should
_be a matter of record. with JMWAVE. The grenades wore
. setts typical military type and numbered about 24 to 48
wes, 4 . Again, however, Subject noted that-be acted only as intermediary
‘bewweon IDEN C and another individual. who ie now deceased ia
e PBRUMEN and did not physically haadle any muritions shipments.
_ As Boted above, continued sensitivity to the question of the amounts
or types of equipment furnished IDEN C ie believed attributable
te ancertainty of Subject's part as to exactly what he did arrange
for shipment to IDEN C. As to the basic question about contact
with him since 2967 (or when he was told by IDEN Q to no longer
bave contact with IDEN C), Subject incisted that be never re-
established contact of any kind but always checks at IDEN 8 to

determine if IDEN C is around.

Do you now have in your possession any arms, munitions or articles
of demolition which-was once the property of the LNHARP? Only
those items which were discussed during-a pre-test debriefing,
via., items brought t Caracas by him in & sultcase and consist-
ing of the following: 3 cr 4 smoke grenades; 6 or 7 booby traps
{army type); 1 piece of delay fuse about 100 feet longs ore primer
cord about 100 feet; 2 or 3 MK2 grenades; about 10 pencile (some
regular open market supply items and some of the "company"
variety); demolition pliers; knife; compass; metascope (infras
viewer worth about $50 used}, These items ke said were taken
while with the IDEN R and with the knowledge of IDEN T although

IDEN T did not know exactly what he had taken. Subject was using
these items frequently in training courses and they were not to
the best of Subject's knowledge the property of LNHARP at that
time although it te poesible that acmo of these items were at une
time LNHARP and possibly WOFIRM items. But he explaingd
further that these itoms are plentiful in the Miami area and can

sation Subject noted that be hao heard of many places where
_-; munitions could be obtained very easily especially in New Jersey,
“ig California and in Miami, but he denied being personally:

Break-down questions dealing with IDEN C:

Answer: Yos.

Did you receive more than $500 from him? Answer: No.

Is it correct that you received thr

Besides tho pencils, stloncors, grenades and pentolite did you give
him any other items?. Answer: No. (aa noted continued senai-
tivity which ie unexplained except in the examiner's conclusion)

Did IDEN Q tell you to etop contacting him in October or November
19677 Answers Yes,

Did you contact IDEN C after November 1967? Answer: No. (Slight
senaitivity but explained as relating to constant checking on his
whereabouts to avoid contact.)

Has your employer contacted him since November 1967? Answer:
No, not to hie knowledge. On thie question Subject noted that his

The caly other items which Subject-cculd think of which could

Feported'on in Miami some months back which hie organisation
took from captured guerrillas and which were probably issued
to a group which went to PBRUMEN and were lost. Subject is
positive-they were WOFIRM issue but purportedly the serial
sumbers which he aubmitted cculd not be checked.

One additional item which was cloared up dealt with the pentolite
which had been reported seen in Subject voluntarily
mentioned that he had seen such & supply under the bed of a friend,
The supply wae attached to magnets which were to bé used to
attach the charge to the underside of a ship in Caribbean waters

of IDEN V or IDEN W naticnality. The charge was to discourage
fartaer shipments between these latter IDENs and PBRUMEN,
Subject sald he detached the magnets from the pentolite and

7 1, The Station desires to explain its viewpoint on AMCLEVE=-15
clearly because of what cculd. concei y, be construed to be a tone
of iepstience in the first line of Reference A. First ofall, why do
we want to hire AMCLEVE-182?" Our cbjcctive is to use hit as a unilateral
venetration of which controls that organization.
ecifically, we would Tike to nenetrate the inner circle surrounding
IDENTITY and CIRASH=4, The recent provocation (reported in reference C)
which we believe was run by IDENTITY is’a clear indication of the need
fer this type of penetrstion over and above the normal need for

penetration of security services.

ae What we are net trying to do is to make a CIGOAL-1 or
ANOT=200 out of ANCLEY is, put him on the payroll as an
iviser to CIRASIH4, be very clear on this point, since
tay he the cause of Headquarters’ concern, His role will not be
ery. AMCLEVE-18 is to he used to obtain counterintelligence
internation to protect the Station and its operations and to get for
us that portion of the intelligence available in CIRASH which is not

which may have ronitoring of KOFIRY activiti s one of its

confirmation From CIRAS#=15 that MICLLVE*+15 docs in fact hold the
position descrihed above, we are of an open mind regarding the

praced ability of his use and we are completely willing to accept any
nation that would =ilitate a nst his secure and fruitful employment}.

MEMORANDUS FOR THE RECORD

“MEMORANDUM FOR AMCLEVE/15's File 14 August 1967

SUBJECT: Salary Misunderstanding

“ORIGINATOR: a

2. ANCLEVE/15 submitted the attached note, written ee
by him, to the writer. -In tho note ANCLEVE/15 says :
“he is not asking for anything but wants tho records checked

Fegarding h' ast salary of $2) 0 per month. ANCLEVE/1S :
claimed his. former CO) tol:
him that effective Octobor he would be paid $id i

per month by BOFACP4 while the balanee would be pleced ina Bante for him,

and not hat eficctive August 1966 (not October)”

he woul eo cut back in his salary, to approximately

$100.00 por month, Ie was cut back from $350.00, not
$325.00, for reasons of oconemy and cover and he was
agreeable to the cutback. The writer did not tell him

that the balance of approximately $212.00 was boing

saved for him; only that his gross salary would be

raised to $350.00 in the event RECK ever stopped paying

him his salary. (It was assumed that his RECE employment
might be short-lived). For administrative reasons the -
salary cutback was not offectivo until September 1966 and ~
from latter date until Docembor 1966 he was paid $111.13,

256, 11 July 1967

“ Reference: : JMWAVE-

o ae 1. As. jorted in.reference, AMCLEVE/15 was terminated
effective 1lJuly 1967. ANCLEVE/IS" was terminated because he
resigned from his position as

p @ Miami base

organization, in-early June 1967 and he thus lost access. to his
target, as AMCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of
RECE’since 1 August 1966. In addition, JMWAVE does not have a
current need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT
organization has the capability to penetrate and report on RECE
if and when the need should arise, After AMCLEVE/15 resigned
from RECE, he was a candidate for employment in the AMOT organ-
ization; however, because of his involvement with Frank "Lefty"
ROSENTHAL and for other security reasons it was decided biti
the AMOT organization should not hire him

2. AMCLEVE/15 began his employment with WOFACT in April
196$ and initially served as an instructor in the Maritime
Training Branch:‘of JMWAVE. He was also active in reporting on
exile activities. On 1 August 1966, AMCLEVE/15 was transferred
to the CI Branch where he was used to report on the activities
of RECE until his resignation in early June 1967.

i 3. Since AMCLEVE/15 was amicably terminated, JMWAVE does
not envision any problems at this time. AMCLEVE/15 plans to
seek employment in through an old friend
who resides there,

me 4. On 21 July 1967 AMCLEVE/15 was given a termination
bonus of $650.00, which is. equivalent. to two months salary, minus
FICA and federal income tax. He was paid $549.60 net.
