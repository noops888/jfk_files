BACKGROUND:

Sabject in a 40-year-old PBRUMEN male who has been of continuing

NOFIRA Interest since Initlal contact with JMWAVE and more recently

with the

7 Station as a penetralion of the IDEN B organization

PURPOSE/ PROCEDURE:

Subject was SCSWIRLed at the requent of the

Station because

of several lagues which tended to question Subject'a bona fidel, possible

airliason with PBRUMEN Intelligence threugh relatives, unreported assoel-

ation with gangeter elements, thefts from WOFIRM, plus other Iteme spectfled

In questione llited below.. The intervlew was conducied in the home of

Osear C. KALBING In both Engllah and Spanlal. (Subject's Engliah la quite

good, however, during actual testing Spanish was used to avoid ambiguity or

misunderstanding of the question conieni.) KALBING did the translating.

RESULTS:

Sabject remaine sensitive to one question which in related to his past

dealings with IDEN C but in fairneas to Subject this sensitivity la belleved

generated by genuine uncertainity over the amount of items which he had

been Instrumental in getting for IDEN C. Sensitivily Initially recorded In

other areas was resolved through post-teat discussion and responses to all

otber queations are regarded as substantially truthlul. Subject was most

cooperative and candid throughout the entire Interview.

DETAILS:

Because of the numerous lasuen which were belleved in need of clarifl

calios, a thred phase tent was atructured prior to the interview and rehearsed

wilh Subject completely before any testing look place. Diacussions, ae noted.

were is both English and Spanish. Spacifie questions asked of Subject and

Have you uned any name besides IDEN Al Asswer: No, arcept

for nicknames and allases used with WOFIRM.

Have you ever travelled to Waihington, D. C.P Answer: Yes.

. Once several yeare ago.

Have jou ever been to the Soviet Unlon? Annwers No.

Are any of your relatives membera of the Communior Party?

After some diacussion Subject fell ll probable that they were.

Those specifically mentioned were ble two brothers IDEN D

and IDEN E and also poselbly a sister named IDEN F who la

almo in PBRUMEN and married to a Captaln In the Militia.

When the quelion was prefaced with the worde: "In it your

• belief that any of your relatives are members, " Subject'e

newer was always yes. He based this belief on the fact that

both brothers hold highly responsible poaltione in key Industries

In PBRUMEN and hence must be member.. He also noted that

prior to ble leaving PERUMEN, ho (Subject) and his two brothere

had many diecussions about politica and their view» dillered

from Subject'". As for hia brother IDEN E. Subject regarded

him ao the "brain" In the lamily and originally a very religious

person who atended Catholle services dally, He later evinced

distrual for lbe clergy la PBRUMEN and ilamed them for the

downfall of the church. When Castro made bis move, IDEN E

wan in complete sympathy with him and remained with him

despite his apparent conversion to Communiam, although

IDEN E never acknowledged that he had been a Communiot and

would usually retort with a comment that he (IDEN E) wae &

"Bumania8."

Are any of your relatlves working for PBRUMEN Intelligence?

His anewer was that he felt that at least one of them was accord

ing to what KALBING Inferred during his discussion with Subject

the day before the SCSWIRL tell. This was hie brother IDEN D,

but he also wondered about his brotter IDEN E who might also be

With PBRUMEN intelligence because according to what his mother

mentioned in a letter some time ago, IDEN E had been in the

USSR Isceiving iraluing of some sort. Thie fralding lasted for

a full year and occurred in 1962 to the bost of Subject's memory.

Subjoct was reancnably sure of thie date because of the Milesle

gence? Anawer: Yes."

Did you mow your brother (IDEN D) was working with IDEN G

before we sold you? Answer: No.

But again had some

suspicions.

Besides the lettere we asked you to send to your brothere bave

you communicated with anyone in PBRUMEN? Answer: Yes..

His mother about two or three times a year and with an mant

named IDEN I which was the person to whom be actually

to write.

hia mother only once and had the letter posted from Miami lo

prevent anyone knowing bie exact whereabouts. (In addition

to thene contacts, Subject has sent one telegram to his mother

soon after the IDEN I Just to let her know he was alright.) it

was abut thim time that IDEN E wrote to him and criticized

his participation in IDEN I.

Have you seen either of your brothere since 1961? Subject answered

no. Last saw IDEN E at the alrport ln the distance but there

were employees from IDEN E's place of employment present

and IDEN E was apparently reluctant to go near the plane. Since

1961 Subject has not seen any member of bia family and as time

goes os dues not mies them an much. The persona be clalme to

have been closest to were his aunt and grandmother and addresses

commenta to them personally when be does write to his mother.

When further discussing hla brothere on this question, Subject

was somewhas complimentary desple their differing political.

views and generally cunsidered them as hard working energetic

types with good achool records.

Do you havo a secret means of contacting anyone in PBRUMEN?

Claims he know of friende who have uned telegrare to transmit

coded messages but he has never engaged in such activity. These

menages were directed againa: the PBRUMEN.

of broadcaste from PBRUMEN which identifled Subject se a

1907 according to Subject and the man flagering him was

IDEN M. The latter was not officially la Sabject's WOFIRM

Anow why lf was that he was specifically somed. When lt waa

later ggested that thie announcement would probably have

ocme alfect on ble family, Subject said be just dida't know

what effect it wculd have and has heard of sone. He agreed

that it was quite ironic that one aide of the family was working

with as intelligonce service which was diametrically opposed

Bo the side to which another member of the same family was

athlated and in fact because of his presest IDEN B employment

ho was actually in the businean of hunting them down. Subject

agreed that it was Indeed tronic but felt his convletion dilfered

with the man.

Subject contended that the contact began quite

Innocently In 1965 and was what Subject Initially thought was a

deliberato provocation to see what Subject'a roaction would be.

Subject Immediately reported the contact to IMWAVE handlera

who gulded him through continued contacts and lastructions from

IDEN Q. Subject was Instructed to sell IDEN C "ollencera" (gune

with silencers attachod--about sla or seven to the best of ble

As reported in reference, AMCLEVE/15 was terminated

effective 1l July 1967

AMCLEVE/15 was terminated because he

resigned from his position ás

I a miami based cuban exile

organization, in early June 1967 and he thus lost access. to his

target; as AMCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of

RECE since 1 August 1966,

In addition, JMWAVE does not have a

current need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT

organization has the capability

to penetrate and report on RECE

if and when

the need should arise.

After AMCLEVE/15 resigned

from RECE, he was a candidate for

employment in the AMOT organ-

ization; however, because of his involvement with Frank "Lefty"

ROSENTHAL and for other security reasons

it was decided that

the AMOT organization should not hire him.

AMCLEVE/15 began his employment with WOFACT in April

and initially

served as an instructor in the Maritime

Training Branch of JMWAVE.

He was also active in reporting on

On 1 August 1966, AMCLEVE/15 was transferred

to the cl Branch where he was used to rejort on

or Race until his resignation in early June 1961.

Since AMCLEVE/15 was amicably terminated, JMWAVE does

not envision any problems at this time.

AMCLEVE/15 plans to

seek employment in

through an old friend

Who resides there.

On 21 July 1967 AMCLEVE/15 was given a termination

bonus of $650.00, which is equivalent. to two months salary, minus

FICA and federal income tax.

He was paid $549.60 net.
