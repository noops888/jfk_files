_on ll February 1964. At the time of his defection, certain

work as an agent in place. On 15 June 1962 Mr.’ Nosenko
returned to the Soviot Union where he resumed his duties as

an intelligence officer with the Second Chief Directorate of
the KGB in Moscow. Mr. Nosenko worked in place in the Soviet
Union until January 1964 when he returned. to Switzerland. “At
that time Mr. Nosenko decided to defect and requested political
asylum in the United States. :

4, Mr. Nosenko defected in Switzerland on 4 February
1964 and was brought to the United States under Public Law 110

financial commitments were made to Mr. Nosenko,..These comm
ments were substantiated in a conversation with him on
7 February 1964 and were documented in a 10 February 1964
memorandum to the Acting Deputy Director. for Plans from
Mr. David EB. Murphy, Chief, Soviet Russia Division (SR Division).
This memorandum stated as follows:

"First, I assured Subject [Mr. Nosenko] that I.

was satisfied that he was genuine. Based on soe
this and assuming his continued 'cooperation' 7
I said we would proceed to. make arrangements
to bring him to the States. Second,:I con- ©
firmed ovr agreement to pay him $25,000 for
each year in place ($50,000)°plus $10,000 for
his part in the Vassall case and our readiness
to contract for his services at $25,000 per
year. ‘Third, I explained the polygraph -he
would be expected to take as final. proof. of.
his bona fides."

5S. Shortly after his arrival in the United States, the
ision encountered serious difficulties in attempting to
rablish the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko. The SR Division con~-
ed that Mr. Nosenko was not what he claimed to be and thus
not a bona fide ector. As noted in paragraph. four of
chment A, Mr. Nosenko was held under highly secure con

Rockefeller Commission Report in June 1975 and that Mr. Nosenko
is aware of this citation. Mr. Nosenko.has, however, made no
threats. concerning possible damages as a result. of this con-
finement. Also, despite the difficult period through which

Mr. Nosenko passed, he has been and continues to be a coop-
erative and productive ‘source.

6. Mr. Nosenko has: been of significant value to this
Agency as a source of information on KGB Second Chief
Directorate activities against, U.S. Embassy personnel in
Moscow. Mr. Nosenko named six members of tie ibassy staff
who rejected KGB recruitment overtures during e 1953-1964
period, and all have confirmed his assertion. A physical
search of the Embassy in Moscow'also fully substantiated
information Mr.:Nosenko provided regarding KCB audio surveil-
lance devices in the Embassy. Mr. Nosenko also provided
information leading to the identification of fifty-one American
KGB-targets and sixty-one’ non-American KGB agents. The most i

it a prominent of these Soviet. agents were a t\
Eo 5 ador to Moscow, a director and a = ee
vl Foreign Ministry and a British Admiralty employce,.,..

Vassall..-Mr. Nosenko is the most significant defector
.we have had from the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB, and
‘as a vesult of this his contributions have been of unique
importance.

7. Prior to 1 March 1969 Mr. Nosenko received no salary
for his cooperation with this Agency. Effective 1 March 1969
Mr. Nosenko was employed as an independent contractor at the
rate of $16,500 per year. Because of the previous difficulties
and uncertainties involved in establishing the bona fides of
Mr. Nosenko, the extent of our commitments and obligations to
him c not clear at. that time. Mr. Nosenko, therefore, was
not initially employed at the rate of $25,000 per year as he
_promised, Mr. Nosenko's salary was increased annually,
atil 1 March 1975 when he began to receive the stipu-
000 per year. Once the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko were
blished and the earlier difficulti regarding hi
‘resolved, the initial commitments took effect and
of $125,000 (less Federal income tax) was completed
er 1972 in ttlement of salary arrears for the
ril 1964 to March 1969 (see Att t BY). On 12 July
11 payment was made on the obligation of $50,000 due ‘
nd 1962-1964.

$8: There remains to. be paid $28,500 (less federal ‘income: *.:
tax) in salary arrears for the period 1 March 1969 to 1 March =
1975 (see Attachment C) and $10,000. outstanding for, the-Vassall",
case. (He has never requested the latter amount but the re
obligation still exists.) Although Mr. Nosenko signed a
quitclaim for the period prior to 12 July 1973 (see Attachment: D)
and may have legally waived his right to back salary prior to
that date, the earlier payment of $125,000 for the period 1964-
1969 recognized our commitment to Mr. Nosenko to honor all
agreements and established a precedent for paying him the total
salary difference. We also believe that we have a moral obli-

gation and that this obligation should be met.

9. This matter is being brought to your attention s
Mr. Nosenko believes he has a valid claim to cited back sa
for the 1969-1975 period and in connection with the current
transfer-of full responsibility for Mr. Nosenko to the Counter-
intelligence Staff, Directorate of Operations. It is, therefore,
ommended that you approve the expenditure of $28,500 in full
ent of back salary for Mr. Nosenko for the period 1969-1975.
Of the $28,500, $27,667 can be paid for out of the FY1974 unobli-
gated balance allotted to the Office of Security, with the 20>
remainder of $833 being charged to the Office of Security FY1975:'
, allocation, :

10. It is further requested that approval be granted for
the $10,000 Vassall obligation, which could be paid directly to
Mr. Nosenko at a later date or preferably could be incovtporated
into a retirement pr am for him, which is being given consid-
eration by the Countcrintelligence Staff... If approved, these
transactions would represent a fulfillment of all commitments. to
Mr. Nosenko as of this date and would serve to Fulfill outstanding
Agency commitments to Mr. Nosenko prior to his transfer to the
Counterintelligence Staff.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence :
THROUGH & Executive Director~Comptroller

SUBJECT : Retroactive Reimbursement ‘of
“Yuriy Ivenovich Nosenko .

.

1. This memorandum suggests action on the part of the
Director of Central Intelligence; this action is contained in
paragraph 9.

2. Mr. Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, a 45-year-old, foriner
i Staff Officer of the Committee for State Security (KGB) of the

‘ : USSR, attended the Institute of International Reletiors, M
. from 1945 to 1956; was affiliated with Russian Naval Inte}. is
during the 1951-1953 period; and wes an officer with the KGB
from March 1953 until his deféction to the Agency in Genev2,
Switzerland, on 4 February 1964, after having worked for GiA.
for approximztely two years.

i 3. A review of Mr, Nosenko's case reflects that, at the
time of his defection, various official commitments were made

4. In the early debriefing of Mr. Nosenko, it became
apparent that he was a particularly complex individual. To permit
nsive and prolonged debriefing, arrangements were made to
- accummodate Mr. Nosenko under highly secure conditions at

ISOLATION, where he remained from 1964 to 1967. ‘hese tight
security arrangements were dictatéd,, during the initiel phases at
least, by the additional need to provide Mr. Nosenko with
continuing personal protection, since there was the distinct
possiblity that he would be targeted for execution if the Soviets
should cover his whereabouts.

5. Since October 1967, the primary r: sponsibility for Mr,
WNosenko has been in the Office of Security, which conducted a
thorough review of prior developments in the case. Mx. Nosenko
was moved to the Washington, D.C. area in late 1967, and the
case passed through various stages of phased normalization, as
he was given an increased degree of freedom and independence,
Mr, Nosenko was actually resettled on the economy in April 1969;
he obtained a divorce from his former Soviet spouse in Septe:mber
1969; and he later married an American girl in October 1969,
During the period from October 1967 to April 1969, Mr. Nosenko |
did not receive a salary, but he was provided with a moderate
amount of spending money.

6. As of April 1969, Mr. Nosenko signed a one~year
contractual agreement for $16,500.00, including a clause giving
assistance to him in resettlement expenses in the amount.of
$8,000,00. In March 1970, Mr. Nosenko signed a new contract
for two years at $18,500, 00 per annum. Ai about this same time
he was provided with certain financial assistance, $20,000.00
being fox the down payment on a new house, and $5,000.00 for
other related household expenses. Mr. Nesenko's contract was
of $19, 500, 00 px

8. In the course of a recent meeting with Mr. Nosenko,
he brought up the subject of his missing salary, covering the
period from April 1964 to March 1969. Mr. Nosenko readily
admitted that he is living very well at the present time, but he
is not in 2 position to save any money for the future. He also
expressed deep appreciation to the Agency for the financial
assistance which was provided him through the years, and he
considers this to have cancelled out the original Agency
obligation of a Jump sum payment in the amount of $50,900.60.
Mr. Nosenko, however, still feels quite strongly that he is
entitled to be reimbursed for the salary which the Agency did
not provide him over a five-year period. He understands, of
course, thet income tax would have to be deducted from this
back salary of $25,000.00 per annum.

9. In summary, the original oral agreement with Mr
Nosenko is fully documented and supports his cleim; his rese
ment since 1967 hes been relatively smooth, with no significant
s having developed; and he continues to function
at the present time as a highly productive and useful source of
information on the KGB. In view of these various considerations,
it is requested that this payment of $125,000.00 to Mr. Nosenko
pproved. These &mds would be paid out of unliquidated
Ss applicable to lapsed appropri so (Fiscal Year 1970
rs--"3i" Account).
