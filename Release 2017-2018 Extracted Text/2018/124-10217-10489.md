According to Ray, the JURE controls the following groups

with forces inside Cuba: the MRP, the 30th of November

Revolutionary Movement, Federacion Estudiantil Univer-

sitaria (FEU, University Students? Federation). Accion

Cristiana (AC, Christian Action) and the Movimiento de

recuperacion Revolucionaria Cubana (MRRC, Cuban

Revolutionary Recovery Movement).

• Present plans are

limited, first of ali, to rebuilding these resistance

forces which have now nearly recovered from the losses

sustained during the April

1961 Bahia de Cochinos

invasion, and secondly, to establishing contact with

noh Communists in Cuba and

persuading them to reject

the Castro regime and to aid the resistance movement

Ray

added that no date will be set for starting the

operations

until sufficient

resources are

A tentative estimate is that

another three months will be required to collect the
