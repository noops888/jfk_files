personally give his blessing to the Frente he said, with a
straight face, that he gave his blessing to any group of
Mexicans which lawfully wished to organize in Mexico
for this was a democracy. He added, however, that he
feared that the Frente was. getting ready to put up a i
candidate for President and that Anericans, including the :
Ambassador, could be embarrassed if they found chem- |
selves involved in this matter.

©. Concerning the question of the Colombian proposal :
which the Ambassador asked him to consider, TLIFENSOR-\o1 :

* said we are late in making this suggestion to him. He H

asked, however, that I advise the Ambassador that he would j
do what he could to have the Ambassador's suggestions :
taken into consideration. He ‘said he would get,in touch-with

Manuel Tello today prior to his departure from Mexico City.

I told him; as ie recorded in memorandum, that the

Ambassador understood. the historical reasons for Mexico's

pésition and also understood that the request was late.

LITENSOR|then raised the question of President Kennedy's

visit which’he said Senator Mansfield had raised. (He said

that he would prefer President Kennedy came in December of o8

this year, 4s he had advised Senator Mansfield, and that his

personal preference was for a meeting in Monterrey. [ He

said, however, that the place of meeting would be left entirely

to President Kennedy to choose, and that security of President

Kennedy and hie party could be guaranteed any place in Mexico.

His personal preference for Monterrey is because he thought

it lesa likely that a emall group or an individual might attempt

to cause embarrassment to President Kennedy and his group,

and that such efforts could be best controlled outside Mexico

City proper. He brought up the question of President Kennedy's

health and the probable affect of the altitude in Mexico Cit

but I told him that I thought President Kennedy's troubles had
been due to his back and not to his heart, and that the altitude
should not affect him.
