b. Concerning the Freate Civico Mexicano, LITENSOR ]

said that he would prefer that U.S. businessmen not give

money to this or any other anti-Communist group in Mexico.

In particular, he raid he feared that this group would get

involved in internal political affairs in Mexico and he thought

internal politics was the businesa of Mexicans and that

Americans should not get themselves involved. He suggested

that Ambassador Mann tell U.S. buginessmen who wish to

make a contribution to the Frente that they could better help

Mexico by investing is private entergrises in Mexico which

would help to raise the standard of living in Mexico and thereby

would fight Communism. When I told him that I would

personally give his blessing to the Frente he said, with a

straight face, that he gave his blessing to any group of

Mexicans which lawfully wished to organize in Mexico

for shis was a democracy. He added, however, that he

feared that the Frente was getting ready to put up a

candidate for President and that Americans, including the

Ambassador, could be embarrassed if they found them

selves involved in this matter.

Concerning the question of the Colombian proposa

which the Ambassador asked him to consider. LITENSOR O)

said we are late in making this suggestion to him. He

asked, however. that I advise the Ambassador that he would

do what he could to have the Ambassador's suggestions

taken into consideration. He said he would get in touch with

Manuel Tello today prior to his departure from Mexico City.

I told him; as ie recorded in memorandum, that the

Ambassador understood the historical reasone for Mexico's

position and also underatood that the request was late.

LITENSOR| then raised the question of President lennedy'

visit which he said Senator Mansfield had raised. He said

that he would prefer President Kennedy came in Decensber of 08

this year, ás he had advised Senator Mansfield, and that his

ersonal preference was for a meeting in Monterrey. r

aid. however, that the vlace of meeting would be left entirel

to President Kennedy to choose, and that security of President

Kennedy and his party could be guaranteed any place in Mexico.

His personal preference for Monterrey is because he thought

it less likely that a small group or an individual might attempt

to cause embarrassment to President Kennedy and his group.

and that such efforts could be best controlled outside Mexico

City proper. He brought up the question of President Kennedy's

health and the probable affect of the altitude in Mexico City;

but I told him that I thought President Kennedy's troubles had

been due to his back and not to his heart, and that the altitude

should not affect hin.
