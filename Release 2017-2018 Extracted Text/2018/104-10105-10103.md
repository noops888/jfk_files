Pages 38-41:

LA Division recommends that the passage on the ter-

rorist kidnapping in the Dominican Republic be deleted

for the following

reasons:

1) This incident is still fresh in the minds

of most Dominicans and it is unrealistic to assume

that it will not be picked up and published in the

local press.

Barbara Hutchison, USIA

one of the

considered as a target for kidnapping. The potential

for terrorist acts against US citizens continues;

three leaders of terrorist-oriented groups are in

prison

and

publication of this item could propel the

terrorists

into action.

2) The close link between the ambassador and

the station, as portrayed in the book could be pre-

judicial to

his public image and might even provoke

the terrorists to target against him.

3)

The station has renewed a (liaison relation-

ship and much effort is being directed toward deve-

loping mutual confidence.

Revelation of details of

lead the increasingly friendly

by a former division chief might

wonder whether

we can maintain contidence on tuture

operations and

thereby throw the new relationship

into jeopardy.

4)

Although the bugging of the thermos was

discovered and appeared in the press, the use of

the Coca Cola case was not exposed and therefore

continues to be an operational possibility, at least

as far as the Dominican Republic is concerned.

Revelation of the technique by Agee should not be

a criterion for further disclosure.
