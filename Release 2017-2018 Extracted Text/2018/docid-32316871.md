PHONE HIM AS HE AND VICTIM HAVE BEEN CLOSE FRIENDS FOR YEARS.

LEDERER STATED ROSELLI WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS, APPARENTLY.

NOT

WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING AND ROSELLI CALLED JUST IO SAY "HELLO."

LEDERER SAID HE COULD GIVE NO EXPLANATION OR REASON FOR ROSELLI'S

MURDER; HE DOUBTED "THE CHICAGO PEOPLE" PUT THE CONTRACT OUT

ON ROSELLI..

CG 9561-CTE ADVISED TODAY AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH SEVERAL

LON BOSSES IN THIS AREA THE MURDER OF ROSELLI SEEMED TO BE OF

LITTLE CONCERN TO THEM. ONE LCN MEMBER INDICATED ROSELLI

"HAD IT COMING" AND THAT "HIS TESTIMONY IN SECRECY" HAD ALREADY

CAUSED TROUBLE FOR A NUMBER OF PEOPLE. FROM WHAT THIS SOURCE

COULD DETERMINE, BOTH THE NEW YORK AND MIAMI "PEOPLE" (LON

MEMBERS) WERE FED UP WITH ROSELLI'S TALKING.

JOEY ALUPPA AND CHARLES NICOLETTI, LON LEADERS IN IKE

CHICAGO AREA, WERE LOCATED AND INTERVIEWED. BOTH REFUSED IO

MAKE ANY COMMENT ON THE ROSELLI MAITER. ADDITIONAL INQUIRY

ON SAMMY "C" VERIFIED WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. SAM

CANZONERI APPEARS TO BE ONLY LON CONNECTED "HOOD" USING THIS

NAME. LIEUTENANI FRUIN, INTELLIGENCE UNIT, CHICAGO PD, ADVISED
