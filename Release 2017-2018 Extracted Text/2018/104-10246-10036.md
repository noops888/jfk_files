1." Summary:"< The: Project continues as before, routinely
producing photos and. information of the activities of AMFINK

personnel’ and their. visitors2(KDAFGHAN was able to implicate
one AMFINK' in a criminal‘activity, but unfortunately the GOM -
whitewashed the case.: Another possible lead to a:solution of
our security problem has.cropped- up’ in. the form:of*(KDAFGHAN=1's:

problems; but. they have yet. to reach the point where they affect
the security of this operation.

2.°. Operational Activities:” With the exception of the month

of March the (KDAFGHANS carried on their activities as usual, : pro-~

viding photographic coverage of the entrance to AMFINK: from 0300 i

to 1800-each working day... In'March, we had KDAFGHAN change his
hours (to-“from 1600-hours,"when the: AMPINKS*Feturn from'lunch, to
2300 hours;.when the last. one usually leaves for. home. This
coverage convinced us that’ most, if not all,.AMFINK clandestine
activity is carried out in the afternoon and evening hours. They

oo
are extremely active during this part of day in the sense of the si;
number ‘of trips they make: outside. of AMFINK. Some even disappearedsy |

completely during most of the afternoon. This information should
help our efforts to surveill. the. AMFINKS...A lucky break was had
when (KDAFGHAN witnessed the return of the Subject of 201-886893 from

his observation of AMFINK he gains a great deal of information of

this, we now find that it has-to be pumped out of him bit-by-bit,

this information to the police through the &oeLactERs}9| up unti1

information they were rapidly able to identify the culprit,

4. The Case Officer and the (KDCALV ERTS have spent a great
deal of time during this period looking for an alternate OP site.
The KDCALVERTS have been looking for one to serve as a basehouse
for*their surveillances of the AMFINKS and we for an OP to replace
the present“KDAFGHAN site. Neither of us has had any luck. The
area is highly desirable because of its proximity to excellent
transportation and because it is a middle class residential "oasis"
in a heavily commercialized area. : We continue to look, but are
now less optimistic on our chances of finding a new site,

5. Security: (kDAFGHAN-1 was sGSWIRLED during this quarter
with no signs of deception. (References B end E) The SGSWIRL
revealed a girlfriend and confirmed his correspondence with
ygiatives in PBRUMEN. It also revealed that he assumes that
OMKDIUCK-19 works for us since he had recommended him to us at
least three times. After the last recommendation (KDTUCK-19 told
O°XKDAFGHAN-1 that Somebody had been investigating hif® and (KDAFGHAN=1
Grew the obvious conclusion, The girlfriced (Referencé*c) is
interesting. An East European immigrant, we have one card showing
that she was the object of the attention’ of the Subject of 201-
012972, a suspect intelligence officer. Unfortunately, neither
Hinmegeaddarters have been able to locate the basic document,
HYOM-13665, 7 June,1965. Because of this, and her sharing one
of the beds in thé KDAFGHAN safehouse with'4kDAFGHAN, we intend
to check her out throughly (see plans and Headquarters" action
required below). Because of our suspicion that,{KDAFGHAN-1 or
KDAFGHAN-2 is possibly being monitored by the AMPINKS, we have
cut our meetings with him to two a month and takes special counter-
Surveillance precautions at each meeting. So far, we have noted
Rothing unusual, Our plans for a CI operation designed to smoke

held in abeyance pending the results of our investigation of the
Subject of Reference C,

si 6. Agent Personnel: There have been no meetings with
GOAPGHAN-2 uring this period except for the one visit by our
echnician to the site .oXKDAFGHAN-1 continues to Show sporadic
Signs of extreme nervousness, if not nentaL instability. In
addition he seems to be becoming more and wore Passive. Through
his observation of AMFINK he gains a great deal of information of
interest to us. While our files show that once he used to report
fais, we now find that it has.to be pumped out of him bit-by-bit,
with he apparently either not recognizing or being interested in
its Significance. In our opinion, an extended vacation away from
KDAFGHAN-2 is long overdue.
