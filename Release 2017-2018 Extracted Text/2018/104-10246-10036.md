viding photographic coverage of the entrance to AMFINK from 0900

2300 hours; when the last one usually leaves for home. This

If by the end of this calendar year we are unable

to locate a new site we will terminate the KDAFGHANS, let the

current site cool-off for a while and then place the new team in

the same place...

The costs of terminating these two agents will

exceed six thousand dollars.

We expect them to resettle in either

WOCORK with the rest of their family or in Spain where they have

property. We foresee no problems in the termination.
