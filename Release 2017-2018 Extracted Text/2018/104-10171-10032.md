L.A, D. Ring & Associates, consulting radio engineers in usshington, D.C, | |
to | |

have recently completed « study on the effectiveness of a special audio servic
/——~"the Havana area. The study is attached herevith. Its conclusicas are thatt

@. Operation vith tvo low-pover transmitters and 35-foot antennas vould
result in a limited sudio service along the shore line and to the rising ground !

* fusediately inland. The signal vould be vory veok and subject to interference

frou television stations on the adjacent channel and could be jammed with ainimm | |

effort.

b. A moderate tncreese in antenna height and a small increase in pover
vould increase the service only « small amouit and vould not produce any
significant inprovenent or render Jamiing particularly difficult.

¢. Transmission froa a height of saws 5000 fest, using only moderate 1
povar (100 watts to 1 kilowatt), would result in — significant improvement in iq
service in all areas and produce a signel requiring considerable effort to Jaa. i

% Aa these conclusions suggest, transmissions from an airplane vould be the
most effective, vhile transmissions frou, the surface vith antennas of up to 35
feet have hinited effectivenasa. Beverthelese, Reference and other debriefings
of persona coning out of Cuba have given evidence of the apparent effectiveness
of the AMSPELL TV intruatons In the Ravana area and indicate that they are worth
: continuing until some more effective medium ie put into use.
