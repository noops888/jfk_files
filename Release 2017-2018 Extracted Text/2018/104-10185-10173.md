A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence

Service until April 1964.

The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of

Intelligence - Doll does not make any regular payments to revo

lutionary groups but pays them only when ther have subritted a

plan for revolutionary action (armes struggle) ard. rave had it

approved in Havana.

therefore, there is no stardard arount paid

to any one group or disbursed in any one country per month or

year, and if no armed struggle is In progress

or being planned,

no mones is given out.

Funds expended in Latin America on the

above basis include the following:

Guatemala

El Salvador

Nicaragua

During 1963, the DGI paid out about U.s.

$250,000.

The Yon Sosa group

$200,000 in one year

its activities

(Included in the $250,000).

In August-September 1963, when the Salvadoran

revolutionaries

were preparing for arned struggle;

they received U.S. $50,000.

They used the funds

for propaganda, however, and were not given

more because they had, in Del terms, misused

the money.

During 1963 the DGI disbursed some U.S. $15,000.

In'addition, the professor,

who was one of

liaison officers in Mexico,

won a suit for some

damage from a company (perhaps Pan American

Airlines) and was awarded U.S. $30,000, some of

which he turned over to the guerrillas he

represented.

Costa Rica.

Honduras

Panama

Venezuela

The DGI gave almost nothing to Costa Rica

bocause there was no revolutionary activity.

: The DGI gave Honduran revolutionaries a little

more tnan to the Costa Ricans because after

the disturbance in late 1963 there was almost

no. revolutionary action, most of the

guerrillas were in exile, and there was a

considerable problem caused by the tendency

agents trained in Cuba 'to split

off from the Party and make their own way.

Before August 1963, the DGI had given the

Vangardia de Accion Nacional (VAN) some

U.S.$30,000.

When the Departamento de

Liberacion Nacional (National Liberation

Department - LN) and the Illegal Department

of. the DCI separated 1a December 1963

(hey had prevlously been combined in one

MA (Irtelligence)

section, the vAN opera

ions were transferred exclusively to the

Illegal Department.

Somewhat later they

were returned to the LN Department.

What

sums of money were expended during

the

eriod of

exclusive Illeral Department

ontrol are not known.

Between 1960 and 19 for revolutionant

the DGI put out more

than U.S. $1,000,000

activities

in Venezuela, in addition to an

unknown amount of arms

supplied from Cuba.

Moreover, one of the best Cuban guerrilla

Major Abelardo COLOME Ibarra,

went to Venezuela in 1962 and was still the

director of operations in 1964.

If COLOME

returned to Cuba after April 1964, when he

was known to be there,

he was probably only

temporarily to collect more money.
