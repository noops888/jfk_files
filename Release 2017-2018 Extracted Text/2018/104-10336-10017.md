CIA-IR-14 Breckinridge files.

CIA/(0GQ will determine the disposition of the files of Scott D. Breckinriage.

**CIA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City Station.

The Review Board has for some time been attempting to determine whether it

has had access to all of CIA's surveillance "take" from the Cuban and Soviet

facilities in Mexico City at the time of the Oswald visit and in the immediate

wake of the assassination. On numerous occasions, the Review Board has asked

whether there was any surveillance take in addition to what is currently in the

collection.

On March 18, 1997, the Review Board provided additional leads to CIA to assist

it in answering these questions. The DO has agreed to check Headquarters

records for the file referenced in HMMW 12451, to search for the crypts cited in

this document, and to search for HIMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches

cited in this document. The DS&T will query its offices for possible records on

Mexico City and Cuba and for the present location of Staff D records. Regardless

of the outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board continues to seek a

full accounting for all surveillance conducted during the relevant time periods.

CIA-IR-16 U-2 files.

Ds&d will provide a folder title print out of U-2 materials for Keview Board

examination, check for records filed under Richard Bissell's name, and search for

OSP files DS&T has also contacted Lockheed for assistance.

CIA-IR-17 DS&t Redords on Castro assassination plots.

HRG will furnish the 1967 IG Report to provide possible search query

suggestions for DS&T follow-up.

CLA-IR-18 DO Office.

The Review Board has requested orally information about a particular DO office.

We understand that you are collecting the relevant information.

Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for

information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE

Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 "A" Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board continues to seek a full

accounting for all surveillance conducted during the relevant time periods.

CIA-IR-16 U-2 Files.

DS&T has provided a folder title printout of U-2 materials for Review Board

examination and has checked for records filed under Richard Bissell's name. The

Review Board staff continues to review these indexes. The DS&T should

continue to search for OSP files.

CIA-IR-17 DS&T Records on Castro Assassination Plots.

plots. The Review Board will provide possible search query suggestions from

the 1967 IG Report.

CHIR18-DO Office.:

The Review Board has requested orally information about a particular DO office.

Since January 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a response.
