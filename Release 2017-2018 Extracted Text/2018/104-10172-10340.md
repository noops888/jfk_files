and, as courtesy vould demeal, asted permiasion to quote IVERSEl's article.

IVERSEN va delighted at Source's interest in the article, gave peruleston

for a speaking invitation. Source said that he would be interested.

The Invitation vas Dom the USSR

Prof. IVERSKN about this satter.

3.

Soon after receiving the invitation Subject and hie wife vere in

the bar of i restaurant in Selsinki, the Kalastaftorype, translated 88

"Fleberman'& Cottage", when Gregorel COLOB, whom Source thinks 18 either

a Consul or Vice Consul at the Soviet Embassy there, and Mu RASKS, &

Finnish Cominist, both case up to his table and introduced thezselres..

GOLOB mentioned Source's Iminent trip to the USSR. COLOB and RASKE sat

down and COLO8 began to discuss the trip further.

Source feele that

COLOB'a interest uny have been prompted by the fact that pror. SOBOLEV bad

lasued the invitation on bedalf of the USSR Academy of Sciences. COLOB

bad about 5 drinks before be and RASKE finally Left. Source retarted to

COLOB earlier that be vas not sure that he would be able to manage the

trip to the USSR financially. COLOB sald he didn't think this would be

any special problem and asted hin to come to the soviet Embassy the

Palloving day to seet the cultural Attache, who could arrange to set him to

tbe USSR and back without cost. At one point in the conversation after they

appointment to see them.

When Source arrived COLOS bad just completed a

somewbet ruthless intervier with some finniab nothers, Who bad been besting

of bin to allow the return of their sore from the USSR. CULOB appeared

quito stern as opposed to the pleasant side of his personality displayed

the previous evening.

COLOR Introduced Source to VORONIN, ho vas particularly cordial

and agreed to finance thefour or five day trip to tbe USUR 1n May. FORONIN

asked 1I Source's Invitation to COLOB for Sunday vas still good and asted 11

he and hia wife could come too. In effect, VORONIR Invited himself, Ebougla

Source said be vas glad to bare his.

Source met fnu SERGEYSY briefly later

1n tbe Interview. Source believed SERGEYEV to be COLOB's chief.

6. COLOB and VORONTH appeared on sunday with their wives bearing a

great many presents, more than the custon vould reguire.

They brought tro

bottles of Stolichnaya champagne, costing 25 rubles for a half liter, which

Source thought to be Russia' finest, also a bottle or vodka, chocalates for

the children, and several otber saall gifts. RASKS and hia wife did not

appear. Actually Source vas disappointed that RASKA did not come as be bad

enjoyed very mich talking vith bin at the Kalastajatorppe the veet before.

RASKE had said that he vas a travel agent and showed Source his passport,

which indicated that be bad travelled virtually the vorld-over and eren to

Kenya and other parts of central Africa. Source inguired of COLOB why RASKS

bad not come and GOLOB gave him a son-commital ansver.

7.

Inter in the evening COLOB called Source aside while in Source's

study and said

to him, "this RASKS 1s a svine."

He said that be bad to deal

constantly with such people but resents the fact that his wife must mingle

with them socially.

He felt that 1t 18 necessary to use these Finniah

Corminiats politically but that they cannot be trusted.

8. The conversation became quite free as the three men drank a 11ter

of champagne and a firth of Scotch.

The wives conversed very little during

the evening.

VORONIN kept asking Source guestions about life In tbe United

States how much professors are paid, bor many cars Americans own, etc. At

first be asked the questions for the purpose of pointing out tha: conditions

vere better in the USSR, but later said that he bad bad a number of alacon.

ceptions about the United States and varned up somewbat. He said that be

The three discussed their general backgrounds freely. In all their

conversations they used Finalsh, which both of the Sorieta knew rather vell.

They did not appear to know other language.

Both had apparently been in

Belsinks for a mimber of years, and source doubted if they had been assigned

anywhere else outside of the lisR before this. Source said that they bad

11. The trip vas postponed until late june.

Source feels that they did not have any undue interest in him. They may bare
