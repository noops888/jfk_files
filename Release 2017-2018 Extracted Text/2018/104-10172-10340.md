SOURCE: Frofessor of Mathematics at a large U.3, University who vas
dn Relsinki on a Pultright Grant.in Higher Mathenstics.

1. In late March or early April 1955, Source vas writing 30 article
on higher mthemitics ani bai occasion to quote an old article written by
Prof. IVERSEN. Prof. IVERSEN is 4 Finnish mathematician in Helsinki,
vinner of a Stalin Peace Frise, and according to Source vas a good mathe~
matician at one tine tut ocv interested only in "Communist peace” mattera.
Source called on IVSRSSN, with vhom he says he has quite gocd relations,
ani, as courtesy vould demtni, asked permission to quote IVERSEN's article.
IVERSEN vas delighted at Source's interest in the article, gave permission
for him to quote it, andinguired if Source would consider going to the USSR
for a speaking invitation. Source eaid that be would be interested. ~~

2. A few veeks after his talk with IVERSEN, he received an invitation
to give several lectures in the USSR. The invitation vas from the USSR
Academy of Sciences and signed by Prof. SOBOLEV, vho bed also written .-..
Prof. IVERSEN about this water.

3. Soon after receiving the invitation Subject ani his vife vere in
thebar of @ restaurant in Eelsinki, the Kalastajtorppa, translated as
“Fisherman's Cottage", when Gregorei GOLOB, vhom Source thinks is either
a Consul or Vice Consul at the Soviet Exbassy there, and fmu RASKE,a
Finnish Communist, both came up to his table and introduced thenselves.

GOLOB mentioned Source's imminent trip to the USSR. GOLOB and RASKE eat

down and GOLOB began to discuss the trip further. Source feele that

GOLOB'a interest my bave teen prompted by the fact that Prof. SOBOLEV bad
{esued the invitation on behalf of the USSR Academy of Sciences. GOLOB

hed about 5 drinks before be and RASKE finally left. Source remarked to
GOLOB earlier that be vas rot sure that he would be able to manage the

trip to the USSR financially. COLOR éaid he didn't think this vould be

any special problem ani asked him to come to the Soviet Eubassy the

following day to meet the Cultural Attache, who, could arrange to get hin to
the USSR and back vithout cost. .At one point in the conversation after they
had had several drinks, Source shoved GOLOB a picture of bis children. GOLOB
became quite emotional ani almost wept. He remarked that be and his wife have
vanted to bave- children for the pest six years, but have had no success. On
parting Source invited OOLO3 and RASKE to come with their wives to his hone
for dinner the folloving Suniay. Both accepted. GOLOB asked if Source

would be shot inviting a Soviet official to his hone, apd be replied that he
would not. GOLOB-said that be didn't think he would be either. GOLOB insisted
on paying the entire check and they departed. ;

4, The following morning Source vent to the Soviet Embassy ss arranged
the night before to meet Yuri VORONIN, the Soviet Cultural Attache and VOKS
representative. Indicently, neither VORONIN nor GOLOB are listed in the



SECRET
Helsink{ telephone directory and it is alvays necessary to bave an \
appointment to see them. When Source arrived GOLOS bad Just completed a
somevhet ruthless interview vith some Finnish mothers, vho had been begging
of him to allow the return of their sons from the USSR. GOLOB appeared

quite stern as opposed to the pleasant aide of his personality displayed
the previous evening. ;

5. GOLOB introduced Source to VOROKIN, vho vas particularly cordial
and agreed to finance thefour or five day trip to the USSR in May. VCRONLT
asked if Source's invitation to GOLOB for Sunlay vas still gocd ani asked if
he and his wife could come too. .In effect, VORONIN invited himself, though
Source said he vas glad to have him, Source met fou SERGEYBV briefly later
in the interview. Source believed SERGEYEV to be GOLOB's chief.

6. GOLOB and VORONIN appeared on Sunday with their vives bearing @
great many presents, more than the custom vould require. They brought tvo
vottles of Stolichnaya champagne, costing 25 rubles for a half liter, vhich
Source thought to be Russia's finest, also a@ bottle of vodka, chocolates for
the children, and several other snall gifts. RASKE and hie wife did not
appear. Actually Source was disappointed that RASKE did not come as he had
enjoyed very mich talking vith him at the Kalastajatorppa the veek tefore.
PASKE hed said that he vas @ travel agent and shoved Source his passport,
which indicated that be had travelled virtually the vorld-over and even to
Kenya and other parts of central Africa. Source inquired of GOLOB why RASS
had not come and GOLOB gave him a non-comital ansver.

7. Later in the evening GOLOB called Source aside while in Source's
study and said to him, "this RASKE is a svine.” He said that he had to deal
constantly with such people but resents the fact that his vife must mingle
with them socially. He felt that it is necessary to use these Finnish
Commniste politically but that they cannot be trusted.

8. The conversation became quite free as the three men drank a liter
of champagne and a fifth of Stotch. The wives conversed very little during
the evening. VURONIN kept asking Source questions about life in the United
States--how much professors are paid, how many cars Americans own, etc, At
firat he asked the questions for the purpose of. pointing out that conditions
were better in the USSR, but later said that he had had a number of miscon-

ceptions about the United States and warmed up somevhat. He said that he
had never met an American family and Source felt that ‘his curiosity was

gemioe.

9. The three discussed their general backgrounds freely. In-all their
conversations they used Finnish, vhich both of the Soviets knew rather vell.
‘They did not eppear to knov other languages. Both’ had apparently been in
Helsinki for a number of years, and Source doubted if they had been assigned
anyvhere else outside of the USSR before this. Source said that they bad
Doth told him that. they bad attended secondary school ani the “Language



SC3ET

Institute", which I presuma is either the Institute of International
Relations or the Higher Diplomatic School. Source thought that both

vere hart Commnists, although they admired che material accomplishments

of the United States, Re our earlier report that OOLOB professes sympathy
for the United States, Source feels that thie atatement probably means caly
that GOLOB expressed to him that the United States and the Soviet Union mist
try earnestly to understand the point of view of the other and bargain in
good faith. He, as vell as VORONIN, is very mich a Soviet Communist, and
not defectable.

10. VOROKLN called Source on 7 April saying that 1t would be dest not
to plan his trip to the USSR for May Day as bad been originally planned sixce
there vould be @ great many dignitaries in Moscow then and it would be difficult
to arrange adequate accommodations. VORONIN asked if he could go the following
week. Source replied that be could not as he was scheduled to leave for E-gland
on & Nay to give a series of five lectures there. lasting til’ the end of May.

i. The trip wes postponed until late June. Source left Helsinki for
Moscov on 22 June and returned & July. Both -GOLOB and VORONIN saw him off
at the train station. This was his last contact with them. In summary,
Source feels that they did not have any undue interest in him. They may have
been asked through channels to te particularly cordial to him because
Prof. IVERSEN and Prof. SOBOLEV had instigated his invitation to the USSR.
Also they had a normal curiosity to meet an American family.

12. If Subject can obtain grants for the trip, be hopes to return
to the University of Helsinki next sumer. After a veek's visit to Ruglani,
be hopes to attend the Scandianavian Congress on Mathematics folloving vhich
be is to speak at the ‘World Conference on Complex Variables in Helsinki. Be
will see Prof. IVERSEN, with whom he says he hes quite good relations, and

will look up GOLOB and possibly VORONIN.

13. Gregorei GOLOB vas described as about 5'6", about 165 lbe., no
glasses, long black vavy hatr vith lov hair-line, dark eyes, well dressed
with vestern suit, gave his age to Source as either 31 or 32 and born either
Odessa or Kharkov, very pleasant'and jovial vith good sense of humor. Has
very attractive wife, name unknown,

Us. Yuri VORONIN was described as 549", about 170 lbs, slim, bo
glasses, told Source he was 34 years old, slightly tense, pleasant but
bas poor sense of Iumor, rather serious. His wife, first name unknown,
is @ professional ballet dancer and 1s consequently not with him much of

the time.

15. Fm SERGEYEV, encountered for only a few mimutes at the Soviet
Bubassy, about 5'6", 160 1bs., pleasant, age about 45, derk hair and eyes,

no glasses.
