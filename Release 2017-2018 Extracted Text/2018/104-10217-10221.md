the arva of peactioal organisational politios. He is rather weak
4m the sense that in a conflict situation he tends to pull back.
In other words he is not aggressive by nature, At the same tine,
8/1 felt certain that Subject's indignation and desire for revenge
were deoply seated in his emoticons and ke would not be able to
vationalise away these feelings.

rather massive but detailed as well. ¥e do not doubt that he will be
caught out from tine to time on facts, and perhaps interpretations ae well.
But tze totality of hie information ~ and the whole perforaance wae without

was aade to shov[___|that his comments on th were not
being made a matter of record. (I took notes during our talk, and always
stopped making notes when such a topic came up.) This is, as KULPA noted in

bia involvement, and the involvezent of hie close associates.
‘End he kept reverting to the topic, and his involvezent in it, throughout
our conversations. We did not share F’LPA's impression that
Aissatisfaction with the in America makes bis
generally anti-American. He dogs say that he would not like to be living
in America for the coming year; but in the context of one who does not wish
to be caught up in a period of growing violence, which{ appears not to
believe to be the solution to the problem. Fe states: "I oan understand
how they feel that way, I can recognize the problems, but I sure don't know
what the eolution to the probles is." His judgments on

tends to condemn individuals ~ he spares no sympathy for the FBI, under
standably - but he does not appear to condemn the United States as a whole,
nor even the United States Government as a whole. At the same time, he
makes no phoney protestations, either.

6. Regarding Cuba, lchowed a similar enotional involvement (he
acknowledges "ay pro-Caetro biaa") but, withal, manages to give a more
Dalances portrayal of the situation than many rabidly anti-Castro
conmontators. (Suba, and Cuban matters, were also similarly lowkeyed by
me during our talke.)

Ye How about hie ideological motivation? We had hoped for some
sore concrete expression than we got, on thie score, but what we have

to the point of becoming a “professicnal anti-Conmunist,” by which he

not blindly or unduly oritioal of ODYGKS. Granted, he criticizes many

1. Forwarded as enclosure are requirements for the debriefing of
Subject. Together with the requirements is a KUDESK narrative on |

a) z ound information
of Katzenbach, Further background on| can be found, if

you have not already done so, in the following spatches:

2. We have not yet bad time to review the tape of your first
session with Subject forwarded with Reference, nor do we expect to
get a transcription completed in time to reach you by 15 February.
The list of names attached to Reference indicate considerable know- j
ledgeability on the part of Subject as well a tendency to pour out
his knowledge in a sort of stream of consciousness style. We fear
that, 1f given the opportunity, Subject will take the bit in his

~ teeth and as much money as he can in his hot little hands and be

’ off and running. To prevent this we would like to suggest that the
debriefing be set up on a tightly organized, businesslike basis. It
would probably be advisable to write up the terms in a Letter of
Agreement contract for Subject's signature before getting started,
making sure to include a paragraph in which ODYOKE's obligations
and promises are limited to the terms specifically enumerated in the
document, We think that any meaningful debriefing will take 3.- 5
days, and there is good reason to believe that Subject will have
information of sufficient interest to justify this expenditure of
Case Officer time. We do not foresee any long range operational
relationship with Subject. While we look at the debriefing as

basically a cne-shot proposition there will probably be follow-up
questions and, perhaps, specific action requests, requiring a later
contact, Therefore, the communication ‘channel to Subject should be
left open on a “don't call us, we'll call you" basis.

3. Im line with the need to put the debriefing on a businesslike
(rather than a "flexible") basis, it might be a good idea to start
by getting Subject to supply a personal history statement from the
time of his first entry into to the
present day, (This can be presented to Subject as a basis for us
to formulate meaningful questions, not as any sort of personal
“confession” on his part.) In addition to providing us with a
check on his veracity, this will set the stage for a debriefing
conducted on KUBARK's terms, not Subject's, It ig important that
it be made clear to Subject at the outset that we want facts, not
speculation, commentary and analysis. Srannaratiad

4. Please charge paymen: ibiect for the debriefing to
Acct, Hr. 5137 - 1468 (Hqs. }O0A). Three hundred dollars
for the initial 2} hours talk with Subject is on the steep side.

One of the most violent reactions came from the heart—
land of capitalism, from the small American faction whi
duces the monthly Hammer & Steel Newsletter in Boston. 7
October issue of the mimeographed oulletin vengefully gives «a
list of eight reasons why Khrushchev fell -—- each one a vin- -
dictive crow of triumph, and many attacking not only Khrush- ' i

_ Chev but basic Soviet policies such as “the distortion of
peaceful coexistence." Pointa 2, 3 and 8 will serve as illus-

trations:
2. ‘Hie German policy -- Khrushchev sought to ingratiate

himself with West Germany. He was obviously ready .
to sell out the German Democratic Republic...

The declining influence of the CPSU among the Social- |

ist countries and the Communist Parties, The pro- :
posed Moscow gathering was shaping up as a conference

of only those Party leaders ready to openly serve

U.S. imperialist aggression against the national 1lib- '
eration struggles. For example, Asian supporters of } |
Khrushchev could have gathered in a telephone booth. ‘

The nuclear success of People's China. Khrushchev i
had maintained that nuclear power was the exclusive 4

Although there is no evidence that the politically insig-
nificant Hammer & Steel group enjoys any direct support frou

the Chinese (as the Ruesians alleged in their “Open Letter” ‘

14, 1963), it has always offered its allegiance to —
