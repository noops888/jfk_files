STATION WILL OFFER EVERY ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION

WITH THE HSCA INVESTIGATORS.

HOWEVER, THE FACT THAT THE

HSCA WILL BE INVESTIGATING TELTAP DERATIONS WHICH ARE STILU

ONGOING CAUSES US CONSIUERABLE CONCERN.

DURING PAST YEAR,

WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASIMG SENSITIVITY ON PART OF OUR

LIAISON COUNTERPARTS AS RESULT OF REVELATIONS AND EXPOSES

CONCERNING CIA AND FBI ACTIVITLES IN MEXICO, ONE OF THE

MOST SENSITIVE OPERATIONS FROM THE MEXICAN POINT UF VIEW

IS TELTAPS, AS SUCH ACTIVITY IS

THE MEXICANS DRAW A VERY DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN HEVELATIUNS

ABOUT CIA ACTIVITIES ORIGINATING FROM CRITICS AND ENEMIES

AND THOSE BEARING THE IMPHIMATUR OF THE U,S. GOGERNMENT.

THE RELEASE OF THE FBI DOCUMENTS DREW A SHARP WARNING FROM

THE

ON INTELLIEGNCE/ MATTERS (CF. MEXICO

CITY 43110%.

ANY PUBLIC REVELATION BY THE ASCA OF JOINT

JELTAP ACTIVITY, JOINT OPERATIONSE OR LIAISON COOPERATION/

IN /INTELLIGENCE MATTERS, MAY WELL RESULT IN THE CURTAILMENT

OF THESE UPERATIONS AND THE LIAISON WHICH HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY

DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS, PLUS THE VERY REAL LOSS OF HIGH-LEVEL

REPORTING SOURCES.
