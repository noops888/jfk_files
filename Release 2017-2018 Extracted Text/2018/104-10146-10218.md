NOTE FOR: Pat Carpentier, OLC/C&R

FROM: '. Gary M, Breneman, OGC

Mr. Ashbaugh's memorandum of 3 March 1978
has been revised per your suggestion. While it is
_-not the intention of OGC to interfere in your relation-
ship with the Committee's investigation, this Office
has an interest in seeing that the cover of Agency
employees is protected while at the same time ad-
vising the employee concerning the perils of perjury.
This interest, of course, becomes a duty when the
employee, as in this case, comes to OGC for guidance
., on these matters. It.would seem particularly impor-
_tant to have OGC input in this matter given the
sensitive nature of the Committee's investigation
vis-a-vis the Agency in an attempt to.avoid even
the appearance of providing misleading information.

sinations on 27 February 1978. Mr. Jeremiah, Aker arranged a meeting with

protection of his cover while dealing with the Committee. It was the initial
opinion of the undersigned that a member of this Office should ‘accompany the
subject to the 2 March meeting in order to advise those present of subject's
true employer and ask that such cover be protected since current employment
was not material to their investigation,

3. The undersigned notified Pat Carpentier of the Office of Legislative
Counsel of subject's ineeting of 2 March 1978, Mr, Carpentier is acting as
the Agency liaison with the House Select Committee on Assassinations.
Coincidentally, present at the time in Mr. Carpentier's office was Gary Cornwell
who is the Associate Counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

' After explaining the situation to both men, it was their opinion that the under-

signed should not accompany the subject and.that subject should stick with
his Department of Defense cover during the questioning. Mr. Cornwell is
aware of subject's true employer and feels that his knowledge is sufficient
notice to the Committee at this stage of the inquiry. The undersigned passed
this advice along to the subject. :

ey



4. Subject subsequently advised the undersigned that he was questioned
on 2 March by four attorneys and one investigator from the Committee staff. He
was not placed under oath, but was asked about his employment to which he
responded using his Department of Defense cover, Subject will notify the
undersigned if he is contacted by the Committee in the future.
