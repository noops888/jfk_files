SUBJECT: Jorge VOLSKY aka Jerzy Stakistaw AJBUSZYC akal Chico

•1. Introduction

as editor of

the USIA Weekly Report on Cuban Developments.

VOLSKY

came to the attention. of JMWAVE because of his extra-curricular

activities which appear to be incompatible with his position as an

employee of the U.S. Government.

A conflict of interests appears to

have developed in VOLSKY's case as a result of his position in the

his USIA position to obtain information for a leftist political

be guilty of duplicity in his dealings with KUBARK.

Cuban citizen of Polish origin whose background includes a two or

three vear period in a Russian prison camp.

Because of this back

ground and the nature of his present political activities, the

following compilation and analysis of the material currently avail-

able to JMWAVE Concerning VOLSKY are deemed necessary and are hereby

presented as a prerequisite to the determination of

course of action to be taken by KUBARK in this case.

2. , Original JUWAVE Operational Interest in Subject

Jorge VOLSKY first became of interest to KUBARK in February

1963 when it was learned that he was the source of an anti-CASTRO

plan known as Operational Leonardo designed to split the Cuban

Regime by the recruitment of certain elements of the Rebel Army and

Militia in the GOC.

This plan had been presented to ODACID through

Tad

SZULC, editorial writer of the New York Times Washington Office,

ODACID sent it for action to KUBARK Headquarters.

The disclosure of Jorge VOLSKY as the originator of Operation

Leonardo came about when a KUBARK case officer contacted SZULC at

his home in Washington concerning the plan.

SZULC was reluctant at

first to reveal the name of the author but did so when the case

officer pointed out that it was necessary for KUBARK to talk to the

source in order to clear up various points. SZULC, stating that he

would rely on KUBARK's discretion to safeguard the identity of his

named Jorge VOLSKY of the USIA in Miami. SZULC related a

short blographic sketch of VOLSKY in which it was revealed that

during World War II, VOLSKY, a Pole, had been a prisoner of war in

Russia.

At Headquarters' request JMWAVE contacted Jorge VOLSKY and

made arrangements to sponsor his plan which involved Cuban infil-

tration/exfiltration ops. It was the intention of KUBARK to use

VOLSKY only as a funding channel for the operation; however, because

of the Station's bellef that the operation's team would inform

VOLSKY in detail about operational matters, a POA was requested on

A request was also made that Headquarters check on VOLSKY's

activities prior to his arrival in Cuba.

•Locally the AMOTs were

requested to provide information on Subject's activities in Cuba.

3. Polish Background Prior to Cuba

Using the information subsequently made available to the Station

by subject in his PRQ Part I,

submitted to JMWAVE March 1963 and the

Headquarters trace reply (Reference A) which includes information

contained in Royal Air Force and Polish exile records in London and

information on Subject recently solicited from various JMWAVE assets,

the following is an account and analysis of Subject's life up to his

entrance into Cuba in November 1947.

In his PRQ Part I Subject lists his full name as Jorge

Stakistaw Ajbuszyc VOLSKY Kraisler, born 8 March 1921 in Warsaw,

Poland. He lists his parents as

Josef A. VOLSKY Zascycki, ar

engineer, and Maria KRAISLER Madeirka, a medical doctor, botk

deceased.

VOLSKY'S PRQ states that his education consists

of high school attended in Krakow from 1930 to 1938 and one year of

medical school at a University in Krakow.

(1) USIA records (information supplied by Subject) agree

with the above,

showing that he attended the St. Anna Lyceum in

Krakow from 1930 to 1938 and the Jagiellon University in Krakow from

1938 to 1939.

The Headquarters trace reply which included a London

Station check of the Royal Air Force and Polish exile World War II

records, however, did not mention his attendance at the Jagiellon

University, stating only that Subject matriculated in 1939 in the

St. Staszic Humanistic College in Chrzanow.

(WAVE comment: Chrzanow

1s West Krakow, 27 miles WNW of Krakow.)

C.

World War 'II Service

(1) VOLSKY claims in his PRQ that during the years 1939

to 1947 he served in the Rayal Ata Force Polish Group, Serial number

705740, rank:

Officer - Cadet, Private Flight Sergeant. In a

different section of the PRQ he also states that he was a prisoner

of war in Russia (1939 to 1941).

This is an obvious contradiction

within the PRQ itself that requires clarification.

The RAF and Polish exile check (Reference A) mentioned

above confirmed service in the Royal Air Force for a person with the

name of Jerzy Stanislaw AJBUSZYC (the first three names of Subject)

8 March 1921, Serial number 705740 with rank:

Leading Air-

craftman Radio Telephone Operator.

This record which is obviously

that of Subject showed that on 19

June 1942, while in the USSR,

enrolled in the Polish Army Service where he served for one year

until 30 June 1943 and then enlisted in the Polish Air Force Service

under the British Operational Command on 1 July 1943 and served until

27 July 1947 when he was discharged at his own request and emigrated

to Ecuador.

The Polish exile representative further noted in

Reference A that in 1942 the Soviets had attempted to subvert some

of the young

Poles who were recruited at that time in the

USSR for

_Polish- Army Service and that such might have been the case with

subject:

(3) (JMWAVE Analysis) It is interesting to note that

Subject's PRQ and USIA records which stated he was in the RAF

from

1939 to'1947 do not agree with his official RAF records which show

that he did not enroll in the RAF until 1 July 1943 June 1942) in

The RAF records

also show that he had enrolled one year earlier (19

the Polish Army Service in the USSR and served in it for a full year

before joining the RAF.

However, even allowing the year

1942 as his

service induction date

into the RAF, there is a discrepancy in what

he reports in his PRQ (1939) and what the RAF record shows (1942).

It is possible that he has falsely reported the date of his induction

into the RAF in his PRQ in order to cover up his activities during

that period (1939-1942).

This was a period of time when great numbers

Jerzy VOLSKY (i.e. Jorge VOLSKY) who was born in 1917 and killed in

at tons ma 104l and Speculated that Subject might have assumed the name

of this man!

In Reference A, Headquarters stated it had made an exhaust

analysis of the allegation that Subject might have taken the name of ti

Jerzy VOLSKY killed in action but found no indication that would justif

that conclusion.

In an effort to determine why Subject's name was car-

ried on the RAF

rolls as AJBUSZYC instead of VOLSKY,

it was surmised by

Headquarters that it was "understandable" because of the length of

Subject's name.

In this regard, it was noted by Headquarters that

Subject had listed his full name in his PRQ Part I as Jorge Stakistav

Ajbuszyc VOLSKY Kraisler.

(2). In analyzing the above interpretation by Headquarters;

felt that if the RAF were to shorten Subject's name on their

records for brevity's sake, they would have been more likely to omit a

second or third name rather than his family name of VOLSKY.

An investi

gation was initiated by JMWAVE in March 1964 to attempt to clear up the

existing confusion concerning Subject's identity.

AMBLEAK-1,

a persona

riend of ubject,

on instructions of his case officer contacted a Mrs.

aurora de'l QUESADA Miranda, a very close friend of the family of Subjec

wIfe, Mercedes ROVIRA Bertran. Mrs. QUESADA f

resident of the Hotel

Terrace Park in Miami, is the wife of David MASNATA Azcue, former

official of the Ministry of State of the Republic of Cuba, and had the

following pertinent information to offer:.

During the Second World. War at a session of the Havana

Rotary Club it was decided to ask members of the Club who had single

daughters to act as pen pals for officers. fighting with the Allied

armies in Europe. Mr. Jose ROVIRA presented the names of his three

single daughters:

Only one of these daughters maintained this corre

spondence

(with two officers), one of whom was Subject, a pilot aviator

in the RAF.

According to Mrs. QUESADA, Subject's father died ir

the Second World War and Jorge had joined the RAF.

She stated that as

far as she could remember, VOLSKY was born in Warsaw, Poland and that

the name VOLSKY was that

of his mother or of a grandmother and that

his true name began with "A" and continued, she believed, with a "w"

and a "z"

(c) At the end of World War Il, VOLSKY, then in London,

phoned his pen pal, Senorita Mercedes ROVIRA, and they became engaged.

As it was not possible for VOLSKY to obtain a visa for Cuba, he obtaine‹

one for Ecuador and arranged to stop over in Cuba in transit.

- (d). Upon VOLSKY's arrival in Cuba, Source's husband, Mr.

David MASNATA; by virtue of his connection in

the Cuban Ministry o:

State, was able to arrange permission for VOLSKY to remain in Cuba.

Within a year of his residence in Cuba, he married Miss ROVIRA anc

because of the fact that his name was virtually unpronounceable, he

decided to adopt the name of VOLSKY legally, stating that this was the

name of his mother of of a grandmother.

Station JMWAVE analysis of Subject's background prior to his

arrival in Cuba is inconclusive.

The following points, however, are

worthy of further investigation:

(1) The fact that the name VOLSKY was overtly of semi-overtly

assumed. by Subject does not totally clear him of suspicion in this

It becomes evident that VOLSKY fabricated a name for his

which would fit his own new name.

three possible solutions to this puzzle emerge:

VOLSKY is the name of a grandmother as Subject claims

and Subject attributed it to his father to avoid lengthy explanations

on forms.

(b) • Subject, AJBUSZYC, took the name of VOLSKY from the

dead pilot for personal reasons.

(c).

Subject is a communist agent who assumed one or both

of the subject names either in an effort to erase a derogatory back-

ground

or,

more likely, to assume a new identity and attempt to con-

fuse

the issue.

Still in connection with Subject's true name,

deliberately withheld information when he made out his PRQ for

JMWAVE in March 1963.

The PRQ specifically calls for "name at birth

if different from Item 1"

(Item I being Subject's full name).

VOLSKY marked the item as not applicable.

(3) The slight discrepancy in education listed in paragraph

3 b. shoula, be checked into.

4) On 8 february 1963 He dquarters reported Jorge VOLSKY as

robably identical with one Joseph *SKULICZ "although this stil.

questionable"

. DIR 16243 dated 8 February 1963).

There are no

Station traces on SKULICZ and further mention of this tentative

identification was never made by Headquarters.

Still to be'explained by VOLSKY are the circumstances

surrounding. his imprisonment in Russia and his joining the Polish

Army Service there

at a time when Soviet intelligence was attempting

to subvert those recruits.

4. Background in Cuba Prior to U.S.

a. Family

(1) VOLSKY reports in his PRQ that on 7 August 1948 in

Havana he married his present wife, Mercedes ROVIRA Bertran.

Immigration and Naturalization Service (I&NS) in Miami has a copy of

this marriage certificate on file which confirms the marriage date

given above and gives the following information:

The full name of VOLSKY's wife is Mercedes

Antonia Juana *ROVIRA Bertran, daughter of Jose ROVIRA and Mercedes

BERTRAN, natives or Spain.

(b) VOLSKY is listed as Jorge Ajbuszyc VOLSKY, son of

Jose and Maria, natives of Poland.

(c) From 1937 to 1938 Mercedes was listed as a student

in Santiago de Cuba and fron 1938 to 1961 as a housewife in Havana:

(2) The fact that Mercedes ROVIRA says she was a housewife

in Havana from 1938 to 1961 does not coincide with the story told

above to the effect that during the war years she was the single

daughter of Jose ROVIRA in Santiago de Cuba,

engaged to Jorge VOLSKY.

It is possible that she mistakenly put the year 1938 instead of

1948 on

her record.

However, that leaves ten years of her life

unaccounted for in the Immigration records.

b.

Business

Jorge VOLSKY reported in his PRQ that he directed and

owned his own business in Cuba from November 1947 to May 1961 when

he left for the United States.

This business, whichhe described as

a publicity office was named Dekora Studio S.A., P. Gomez 283, Habana,

and was subsequently confiscated by the CASTRO Government.

also told AMLAME-1 that in addition to his publicity business in Cuba,

he had rendered services to the Information Service of the United

States Embassy in Habana. The following reports on VOLSKY's business

(a) AMOT-119 described VOLSKY's business, DEKORA, as a

helped him financially to set up this business.

Mrs. QUESADA reported that the ROVIRA family was

very wealthy as they were the proprietors in Cuba of the CASTILLO RUM

and CINtHA REX enterprises, among others,

and that Mr. ROVIRA put

VOLSKY to work in a decorating firm which he owned.

formerly in the advertising

billboard business in Cuba, reports

(c) Aureliano ASBRETON, that when Studio Dekora was

nationalized VOLSKY was working on a large

advertising plan for

Central America ordered by the Coca Cola bottling plant in Cuba.

• C.. Contacts'and Travel

(1). VOLSKY traveled frequently while in Cuba and amassed an

extremely large number

of influential contacts. He was a member of

the Havana Biltmore Yacht and Country Club and

predominately

mingled with the upper class professional industrialists

particularly cultivated the friendship of American journalists.

(2) •According to his PRQ, VOLSKY traveled to Europe in 1957

on a pleasure trip at his own expense and also had traveled to the

United States many times during the years he lived in Cuba.

He also

Ilsted frequent travel to Jamaica.

d. Politics

During the period before his business was nationalized,

VOLSKY is described as a socialist, who had publicly said that the

of the world is socialistic. He was avidly pro-CASTRO and

had often denounced the United States for putting up with the BATISTA

Government in Cuba which was riddled with graft, (AMOT-119 Report

AA-774/1?, September 1962) •

According to Tad SZULC, see Paragraph 5 below, VOLSKY

became disenchanted with the Regime when his business was intervened

and he spent the latter part of 1959 and most of 1960 actively

supporting anti-CASTRO activities.

SZULC amplified this remark by

stating he knew of instances of VOLSKY's transporting explosives and

hand and shoulder weapons in his private car.

(3) VOLSKY was arrested and imprisoned in La Cabana prison

around 20 April 1961 during the Invasion

roundup, an event he has

made much of ever since and has used to establish counterrevolutionary

bona fides.

AMBLEAK-1, who was imprisoned during the same period,

stated that VOLSKY was held for a short time, a matter of weeks, and

probably had been included in this roundup because he was a known

'MRP. member,

foreigner,

or member of the middle class.

According to

Tad SZULC, VOLSKY was able to leave Cuba shortly thereafter as he had

a valid U.S. visa in his passport. VOLSKY arrived in Miami on

22 May 1961.

5. JMWAVE Knowledge of VOLSKY Relationship with Tad SZULC

a. On 17 September 1962 AMOT-119 presented a report to KUBARK

which contained information to the effect that VOLSKY had influence

A close relationship exists between

SZULC in Washington and VOLSKY In Miami and they are in touch

periodically by both telephone and personal VisIts. VOLSKY 1S a

source of information for SZULC and evidently influences his thinking

as is manifested by the transfer of VOLSKY's political philosophy

into the principal thesis of a book on Cuba written by SZULC:

that Cuba should not be attacked by the United States and that the

Cuban problem can be solved internally. This book entitled, The

pressure, diverted a case which might otherwise have been presented

SZULC, and obviated a situation which might otherwise have been diffi-

cult and embarrassing for KUBARK.

VOLSKY and SZULC were in very frequent contact with each other

during the IMWAVE sponsorship of the VOLSKY plan.

This fact was

ascertained through VOLSKY's comments to a JMWAVE case officer in

which he often referred to recent activities of SZULC and through the

reactions. of SZULC and VOLSKY when any decisions concerning the opera-

tion made by Headquarters or JMWAVE were relayed to one member of this

partnership without the knowledge of the other.

Decisions concerning

the operation handed out by Headquarters and JMWAVE had to be given

simultaneously to SZULC and VOLSKY in order to avoid misunderstandings

which would arise when one would immediately inform the other of same.

It is mere speculation to guess whether there is more to this

relationship than that mentioned in paragraph 6.e.

interesting to note, however, that on 6 January

1964 in a conversation

between AMICE-14 and a JMWAVE case officer concerning language abilities.

AMICE-14 remarked that VOLSKY and SZULC always speak together in Polish.

When asked if they conversed in Polish so that no

one would be able to

understand them, AMICE-14 replied that he thought it was just to practic:

the language:

This fact does not agree with VOLSKY's earlier statement

tO COS. IMWAVE that he preferred not to speak in Polish because he had

not used the language for a long time.

It seems strange that VOLSKY

would refuse to speak his native tongue with COS unless he were afraid

that his

accent or pronunciation would disclose some element of his

background which he did not wish so disclosed.

On 20 February 1964, Chief of Station,

JMWAVE, had luncheon

with Conrad MANLEY, Chief of the Miami Office of USIA.

During this

luncheon, in a discussion of VOLSKY, MANLEY stated that he was aware

that VOLSKY was the unofficial stringer for SZULC of the Times and

that his superior in Washington had recently brought this relationship

to his attention, asking MANLEY to discourage it.

The reason for this

was that several

newspaper personnel in the Washington area had com-

plained to USIA about

the preferential treatment afforded SZULC by his

relationship with VOLSKY.

The most recent information indicating that the SZULC/VOLSKY

relationship continues is a letter written on

23 February by Theodore

DRAPER, well known author and political analyst, to Miss Phyllis FREEMAN

Frederick A. Praeger Publishing Company,

(Reference B). In this

letter DRAPER recommends that VOLSKY be chosen as the author of a book

to be written on Cuba and set up an appointment for him to meet FREEMAN

while he was in New York.

Reference B also includes a memorandum in

which FREEMAN, reported that VOLSKY was highly recommended for this job

by both Theodore, DRAPER and Tad SZULC who rely on him for much of their

lay to day information on Cuba.

She stated that VOLSKY "is now a

"stringer' for the Washington bureau of The Times, which is evidently

a special SZULC-engineered deal"

AMCARBON-1 reported on 24 May 1964

that VOLSKY receives $100 a week for his work as a stringer.

In regard

to VOLSKY's forthcoming book, he has mentioned to AMBLEAK-1

expects to have it published

VOLSKY claims that he was educated in England and that he had gone to

Cuba in 1945, a decidedly different version of his background.)

VOLSKY's Knowledge of the Cuban Exile Community

a. VOLSKY Refugee Status and Personal Life in Miami

(1) In a recent conversation with AMLAME-1 VOLSKY stated that

he had become an American citizen.

(2) A check of Immigration and Naturalization Service records

in Miami shows that VOLSKY is not a citizen of the United States as he

but became a permanent resident on 5 February 1963, and that

VOLSKY's wife, Mercedes ROVIRA, had petitioned for this status for him.

Menendez, editor of REPLICA newspaper, that JURE pays for REPLICA'S

printing

soon as it is published. (JMWAVE traces on LESNICK, 201-209258, show

origin.

background that includes association with communist elements and at-

is to counter pro-BATISTA propaganda in the Cuban

refuse to help him (LESNICK) and that he would take his case to Harvey

asked COS if he could insure that LESNICK receive the necessary funds

to stay on the air.

Cos Informed Mr. SUMM that JMWAVE had access to a

number of radio outlets and if he or USIA had a propaganda theme or

basic message they wanted delivered to the Cuban people, KUBARK would

be glad to accommodate them if this material were in keeping with the

broad policy concepts under which JMWAVE was currently operating.

SUMM stated he was not interested in themes or programs, he was merely

interested in finding a sponsor for LESNICK and became irritated when

IMwAVE would not comply with his wishes.

He indicated that he intended

•(a) On 13 July 1963 CISNEROS approached Esteban LAMELAS

Maura and requested information from and concerning Cuba in order to

facilitate the infiltration of JURE members into Cuba.

When LAMELAS

refused to give

that type of information, CISNEROS said he would see

VOLSKY and get it from him.

Jose AGUIAR Fernandez to his USIA offices to interview two refugees w

CASTRO:

On the nigt

of 1 May 1963 A-1 gathered with AMICE-27 and others at his home to wc

on the draft again. A-27 took the draft home with him, stating that

just wished to polish it up a little.

VOLSKY who was an experienced writer of policy papers and who liked t

paper very much.

VOLSKY told A-27 that he would get in touch with

AMBLEAK-1 directly to discuss the paper.

After about a week of phone

calls from VOLSKY, A-l agreed to see him and subsequently met him and

received his original paper back.

A-1 then began to be plagued by

visits from VOLSKY at the UR offices plus phone calls in which VOLSKY

entreated A-1 to take

the paper to Harvey SUMM.

On 18 July 1963 at a meeting between VOLSKY and a JMWAVE

case officer, VOLSKY stated he had recently undertaken to assist the

in the propaganda field.. He said that the UR was starting a new dail

radio program over a New York radio station, lasting

twenty minutes a

day, and, that:it will be. specifically tailored to attempt to increas

to resist within Cuba and particularly attempt to reach the

higher military echelons.

VOLSKY said he had originally written all

the VOA broadcasts for over a year after he came to Miami and that he

therefore could greatly assist the UR'with their new program.

whether the UR had anybody to write the program or whether he would

actually write it himself, VOLSKY said that the UR has one good man b

that he himself expected to have a major hand in editing the program.

He said that because of this he was spending a great deal of time at

Headquarters.

(JMWAVE Analysis) VOLSKY is in contact with a large segment ‹

the influential members of the exile community.

This is the conseque:

of his USIA position which affords him the opportunity to make these

tacts to solicit information for propaganda purposes.

graph 6.c., he himself being responsible for all JURE propaganda. By

his own admission, he is now close to the top echelon of the UR, resp

sible for the direction of a UR radio propaganda program. As seen fir

the foregoing, VOLSKY has maneuvered himself into a remarkably advan-

tageous and influential position regarding U. S. Government and Cuban

exile matters, According to VOLSKY his notivation is clear, he claims
