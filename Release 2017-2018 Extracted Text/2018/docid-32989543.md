Senator Mondale. Thank you vary much, Mr. Chairman,
I have always supported the FBI. It is clearly the finest,
most professional law enforcement agency in the nation wand
probably in the world.. In apprehending robbers, foiling
kidnappers, catching fugitives, the FBI has an outstanding
record. ,

This is based on my own exparience with the FBI dn my

own state where I served as Attorney General. The vast bulk

.o£ its work is devoted to law enforcement and legitimate

counter-espionage,

In these fields the FBI deserves fully the admiration
and respect which Americans traditionally held for the Bureau
and its personnel. But in one area, domestic intelligence,
the FBI, in my opinion, has clearly gone astray: It now
appears that there was ca underworld within the FBI which
took the tools, Paneer and zeal which was so effective
against the real foreign threats and turned. them ian upon some
of the American people. ,

Yesterday this Committee heard ‘some of the most disturbing
testimony that can be imagined in a pei society. We heard
avidence that for decades the institutions designed to enforce
the laws and constitutions of our country itself has besn
engaging in Geaaate that violates the law and the Constitution.

We heard that the FBI, which is a part of the Department of

Justice, took justice into its own hands by seeking to punish

those with unpopular ideas. We learned that the chief law
enforcement agency in the Federal government decided that it

did not need laws to investigate and suppress the peaceful

“and constitutional activities of those whom it disapproved.

We heard testimony that the FBI, to protect the country
against those it believed had totalitarian political views,
employed the tactics of totalitarian societies against
American aot We heard that the FBI attempted to destroy
one of our greatest leaders in the field of civil rights, and
then replace him with someone of the FBI's choosing.

From the evidence the Committee has obtained it is
clear that the ‘FBr for decades has conducted surveillance over |
the personal and political activities of millions of eee
Americans. Evidently, no meeting —_ too small, no group
too insignificant to escape their attention. It did not

commonly called enemy lists, of ge tag of Americans and
targeted many of the Americans on these lists for special
harassment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were victims
of this surveillance program. Most of this was done in secret.
Much of it was kept from Congress and the Justice Department

and all of it from the American people. No one outside the

FBI has ever had ah opportunity to know and Sppeeaiaes the
full extent of the domestic. surveillance program that was
then being conducted. tae =

, Thus we see that just as in the case of the CIA the
key issue was accountability: How we can assure that the
secret instruments of ne are accountable to the
people, .the Congress andthe law.

It is clear that the FBI's authority for these programs
is Pease Vale pier peur I am not persuaded that the
Secret presidential orders pipe e ieee Roosevelt support the
Domestic Intelligence peogran: and even if it did, I do
not believe that any President has the authority to order the
FBI or anyone alse to. spy on Americans, to burgleé their homes,
to wiretap ‘them, to open their mail or to blackmail them.

: One of the most disturbing aspects of this affair is
that the FBI never paid very much attention to whether their
activities were authorized or not or whether they were legal
and constitutional. One former-senior intelligence officer

has testified that he never once heard a discussion about

legality or constitutionality. Most governments in history

have relied on some form of police power to determine what
views would prevail in theit society. However, America was
“based on the. revolutionary ‘eoncept that the people should
decide what is right and what is wrong, what is acceptable

and what is not.

.That is ee we maant by. & free government, and our
forefathers were convinced that: it can «exist only through the

greatest tolerance of ‘speech and opinion, They placed their
faith in the people to remain alert to encroachments on their

The foundérs of our country knew that the greatest
danger to freedom comes from the efforts of government to
suppress the opinions of its opponents they. set upa
system which limited the powers be cavities bound it in
the constraints of the law, and prohibited it from infringing:

For the 200 years of our eee as a nation the
preservation of Liberty has. baen a constant struggle. . Whether
it has: been the alien and Sedition Acts ee the French
Reveiweroue thé Red Scare and the Palmer Raids of World War
I, or McCarthyism after World War “II, or Army. spying during
the Vietnam War, the government has let a-fear of unorthodox
opinion lead it into the trap of infringing upon the
Constitution in the name of internal security.

The issues we confront today are a part of a continuing
drama of American democracy. It is proof, if we aver needed

it, that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.

Revelations of.abuse of power, do not threaten domestic
security. These hearings do’not weaken the FBI. What weakens
it is its failure to adhere to the proper role of law
enforcement, aoe it forgot that this was its job. It
began to use its energy to spy on Americans whose only
offense was an expressing opinions that some in the FBI did not
like. It confused talk.of violence with acts of violence,

and all too- often paid more attention to the talk than to

‘the “act.

The answer, of course, is that viglence justifies

prosecution, not survéillance.. Our sacurity is not improved

‘by watching those-who commit crimes. Security from violence

lies in active and vigorous law enforcement of those who
ate committing crimes. -Security fram dangerous: ideas, if

Mr. Chairman, may I say that yesterday I am told that
following our hearing the FBI responded exactly in the spirit

that I had hoped it would. If they can take this constructive

approach, I have no doubt that the BBI will benefit from

this attention. I want to see .@ strong FBI, an FBI strong

in law enforcement, in the detection of crime, and in the-

gathering of legal evidence: for prosecution and coriviction,

‘but an FBI without abuses...

“AS we ._proceed, with these hearings today, ‘we. should also
bear in mind the responsibility for the abuses we have

uncovered does not rest on the FBI alone. We in.the

Congress have been derelict. It should not have taken until

this date for us to discharge our responsibility for
investigating FBI and other domestic intelligence.

+ We showla also realize that the FBI has. been performing
a function which many Americans, oa at times the vast
majority of Americans, aN wanted to seé undertaken. When

popular opinion brands a group unAmerican and subversive

has reponded to public expectations and from pressure from
ae higher authority in government.

While this does-not excuse what happened, ‘. should
temper — criticism of the FBI's excesses by understanding that
in large a it was only the tiseeument of our own intolerance |
Indeed, I believe that is why our laws and the charter of the
FBI must -be carefully redrawn to protect the FBI's integrity
eect political pressures and hysteria. :

Finally, it would be a mistake to regard the abuses
of the -FBI a those of evil men. ‘the FBI has always been
composed of dedicated and hard-working public servants who
seek to do their jobs as pest they can, the lesson we learn
from this history is that we cannot keep = liberty secure,
by relying alone. on the good faith of Pere with ‘great power.

As Mr, Justice Brandeis once wrote:

"Experience should teach us to be most on guard to
protect liberty when government's purposes _ beneficient.
The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in the insidious
encroachment of men of zeal, well-meaning but without
understanding." i paerinietiaatiees' aa

It is my hope that the FBI witnesses we- will hear today
can enlighten us as to how it can conduct .internal security
surveillance eee which do not infringe on our

constitutional liberties. I hope they can suggest iron-clad

assurances that the abuses of the past will not be repeated.

indication to the eee that they could do what they did.
I don't want to go too far in suggesting that what we heard
yesterday was simply responding by the Bureau to the mood
of those years.

In those’ years if we had“ known what you were doing,

Badges Mondale. That is true. I think one of the

points that we might aver to is the Houston Plan and the

“tremendous pressure the FBI was ‘placed under to again resume

techniques that it had abandoned in 1966, There is no
question that they were getting private pressure from higher
authority to do things. In that instance they didn't want
it. :

The Chairman. Well, I ‘was struck with the fact that

the Houston Plan, as illegal as it was, was limited to techniqu

far more restrictive than the far-reaching methods that were

The Chaizmen, Is it true that the FBI on another occasion

approximately 25 incidents, I believe, of actions taken in
this regard. I think Mr. Schwarz has those available, that

I would lump basically all of them into the same situation an

Mr! Adams. In looking at absolute motive, I don't think

anonymous letter was sent to Dr. Martin Luther igs and to
Mrs. Ring, Coretta King, his wife, which was sent 34 days before
he was to receive the Nobel Peace Prize?

Mr. Adams. It was before!.he was to receive it. I think
34 days -- upon reconstruction by one of the members of my
staff, 34 days would have been Christmas Day, and time tee that
34 days -- ;

would be written on Christmas Day.

material. So I think we can assume -~

The Chairman. Other materials which were sent.

Mr. Adams, That's right. So Tt can assume that the letter
was sent. I have determined nothing from my review of the
files, and neither has your staff, to my knowledge, or has been
reported back to me which would indicate that this action was
duly recorded in any file or was a--part of any authorized
program or anything else. this is a void that I donot think
any of us has been satisfactorily able. to resolve.

’" The Chairman. We know the letter appeared in the files. We
know that the letter was received. We know it.was associated
with other matters that were sent by the FBI to Dr. Martin
Luther King.

Mr. Adams. the letter was never in our files in the sense
that it was entered into the official files of the FBI. “te was

You are done. There is but one way ovt for you.”

Now, if you had received such a letter, how would you have
interpreted it? What would you have thought" it meant?

Mr. Adams. I have read that statement. I have heard the
conclusions of your staff that it was a suicide urging. I can't
find any basis upon which they drew that conclusion. I think
that, approaching it from an objective standpoint, as I read it,
I don't..know..what-itimeans.

I think rather than a conclusion it should be a speculation
in 5 realm of .possibilities as to what was intended, but I
cannot -- I don't understand the basis for.it. It is a
possibility, but I certainly ie not reach such a conclusion
from my.reading.of that.statement.... :

The Chairman...Now,.if.you had.received.a letter.of.this
kind. and.it.had.been directed to you, if.you.were in Dr. King's
position and you read, “King, there is only one thing left
for you to do. You.know.what:it.is. You have just 34 days in
which to do it." Now, that happened .to. correspond to. the time
before which he was to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. What
would you think that .meant?.

Mr. Adans. I would have to consider what I was being
accused of. I would have to consider what the facts were. I
would have to consider what the intent of the person was writing

such a note, coming just before Christmas. I don't know if it

means, it is an urging to repent from something this person,

the FBI's favor?

Can you think of any justification for such activity on
the part of a law enforcement agency?

Mr. Adams. I can't think of any offhand, no, sir.

What is your. understanding, if you have any understanding

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir. I know that, of course, on the
wiretapping on Martin Luther King, it was approved by the
Attorney General. I know that the President of the United States
and the Attorney General specifically discussed their concern
with Dr. King over:Communist influence on him. I do know there
was concern, but I don't tie in this date, 1965.

very sensitive surveillance. of.Dr. King?

the actual.surveillance that was instituted on Dr. King. I
don't know of any correspondence between Attorney General

that would have indicated the level of the Attorney General's

Mr. Adams. No.

If my recollection.serves me.correct, as far as Attorney

General Kennedy was concerned, .he requested.coverage.on Dr.
King. The Bureau responded with a request in writing, which

is our normal procedure. He declined to approve that request,
and then we came back later, a few months later and requested

it again, at which time he did approve. That is my recollection

of that.

Senator Tower. Why did the Attorney General change his
mind? Do you have any idea, or is:..that again a matter of
sensitivity?

Mr. Adams. I don't know why he actually changed his mind

from originally requesting, then declining when it was submitted
and then approving it on the second go round.

It may be in the files. If it is, I would be glad to see
what I could determine.

Senator Tower. If you could, we would like to have that.

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Tower. Mr. Adams, you have been familiar with the
Bureau's domestic intelligence work for many years. How did

the Buréau come to. launch the COINTEL program and what in essenc

did COINTELPRO accomplish?

Mr. Adams. Well, the program as such, as I can reconstruct
from the files, was.indicated as concern over conspiratorial
efforts of certain groups, and a.decision made that perhaps
more affirmative .action.should.be.taken to neutralize violence
\which was becoming of more concern.to the FBI in that regard.

I beliéve these are some of the basic considerations that went
into the launching of the .COINTELPRO.

Now, as far as the first one, which was. the Communist
Party, of course, there was the concern here to neutralize the

effectiveness of the Communist Party in the United States. In

fact, out of ali of the COINTELPRO operations that were approved

59 percent of them were directed at the Communist Party. The
bulk of the concern initially was with the Communist Party and
it was a desire to create factionalism within the Communist
Party and try to neutralize its efforts.

The Communist Party, Congress itself, still has a determinat
tion on the record as to the threat of the Communist Party in a
statute. The Supreme Court has held that the Communist Party is
an instrument of the Soviet--Union. The Soviet Union certainly
has not relinquished its interest in the United States as a
target. All of these. considerations.went into should we do
something not only to. follow. the. activities of the Communist
Party, but should we destroy its effectiveness in the United
States.

That was the first program, I believe, that. was initiated.

Senator Tower. Wow, did the Bureau ever seek direction and|
counsel from the Attorney Generali on any of its COINTELPRO
efforts or specific programs?

Mr. Adams. As best as I can reconstruct, Senator, there
was no direct authority. requested from. any Attorney General for
the initiation of these programs,.and..it is only a question, as
your state presented yesterday, that the Attorney Generals,
Presidents, Congress, had been made available of certain aspects
of programs after the fact and those were primarily concerned
with the Communist Party and, oh, one other organization but

not the New Left and these other types. So I cannot find any

evidence, and I have no reason to believe that there would be
any evidence that the Bureau initiated these programs other than
- an internal decision.

Senator Tower. Well, were reports on these programs made
to the Attorney General? Was he informed of them? Was he kept
informed on a continuing basis?

Mr. Adams. He was kept informed by letters, which again
the staff'has alluded to, letters reporting certain developments)
For instance, one of them that went to one Attorney General,
reading of that letter outlined almost in complete detail Klan

activities, activities taken to disrupt the Klan. It used

terms of neutralize, disrupt. There was a clear explanation of
what we were doing against the Klan in that regard.

Senator Tower. How is it that you came to believe that yo
had the authority to neutralize or disrupt these organizations
rather than proceed against them frontally through prosecuting
them for law violations?

Mr. Adams. I.guess you would have to say, in a position

designed to prevent revolutionary groups .from advocating the
overthrow of the Government, and.then subsequent .interpretations|
as .to the constitutionality of .it leaves us with a statute
still .on the books that proscribes .certain actions, but yet the
degree of proof necessary to operate under the few remaining

areas is such that there was no Satisfactory way to proceed,

and it was an area where --
The Chairman. Will the Senator-yield at that point}; please?
What’you are saying, Mr. Wannall --' Mr. Adams, ae

me, is that you did not operate within the’ law because the

law didn't give you sufficient latitudé:. Therefore you under-

took direct action to disrupt and otherwise undermine these

organizations.

Sénator Towers. Did you proceed on the assumption that

w

these organizations would eventually break the law, and therefor
you sought to neutralize and disrupt. them before they did?
Mr. Adams. I can't say that, sir. I think that the eae

gations of them were based on this belief, that they might

break the law or they were breaking the law. The disruptive

activities, I can't find where we were able to relate to that.
What it boils down to is what we have gotten into a question
before on: in our review .of the situation ‘we .see men of the
FBI recognizing or having a good faith belief that there was
immediate danger to the United States -- :

Senator Tower. All.right, but to. repair to Senator Church's
question, you don't say that you really had specific legal
authority.

Mr.tAdams. No. And this is the hangup with the whole
program, and which we are not trying to justify, that there is

some statutory basis.. I would not make that effort whatsoever.

All I'm trying to do is say that at the time it was initiated,

we had men who felt-that: there was an immediate danger to the
country. They felt they hada responsibility to act and having
felt this responsibility, did act. And lthis is the whole problem
we haverat :‘the-present-time, because we do have, one, we can
see good evidence of their belief there was a threat. We had
cities being burned, we had educational institutions being
bombed. We had deaths occurring from all of these activities.
We had a situation that.we didn't know what the end was going
to be. We never can look around the corner in intelligence
operations. We don't know if ultimately this might bring the
destruction of the country. All we know is we had an extremely
violent time. .So'I.don't find any basis in my mind to argue
with their good faith belief .they.were faced with a danger.
Now, when they -move over to the second area of responsi-
bility, here is where we have the problem, and I think it is
the whole purpose of this Committee, the Attorney General,
Mr. Kelley, all of us realizing we.can't operate. in these areas
where we feel. responsibility. but. we..don't..have a mandate by
Congress. So in that area; this: feeling..of. responsibility
I. feel. came. from. the .fact.that. Presidents, as your staff said

one really provided direction and guidance or instructions

that our whole domestic intelligence operations were secret.

The COINTELPRO operation was. I mean, I think we all agree that
this was, to be effective, they felt it should be secret. But
back in our -- this is printed appropriation testimony which ,
went to the members of the Committee. It was mailed out to
newspapers, friends, anyone that was interested in it, back

Left movement, Young Socialist Alliance, Chicago trial, nationwide
demonstrations, student agitation, anti-war activities, the
Committee of Returned Volunteers, Communist Party;/U.S.A.>,
Progressive Party, Socialist Party, extremist organizations,

them. They didn't tell them, though, in sufficient detail other
than scantily before the Appropriations Committee what we were
doing to disrupt these activities, and my feeling is that the
men recognized the danger, they pointed out the danger to the
world. They said, we are investigating these organizations and
they felt then that the comfortable climate of leave it~-up to
the FBI, we should do something more. And that is what we are
looking for guidelines on, the Attorney General, Mr. Kelley,
you, thati.give.us the guidelines under which: we:should:. operate.

Now, there are certain guidelines that we don’t need to

domestic intelligence field. But beyond that, we need guideline}

Wouldn't you agree?

Mr. Adams. I would say that looking at it today, we should
have looked at it that way yesterday, but I do feel, I don't
have any doubt about the good faith of people recognizing the
danger, feeling they had a responsibility, no matter ansee fault
it was, ours internally or bedause we weren't given athe: super-
vision we should have been given, and taking what they considered
to be appropriate action.

The Chairman. Senator Hart.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I should apologize both to
witnesses and my colleagues on the Committee for scrambling
around loosely, but in explanation to the witnesses, I have not
been able to give attention to the evolution of the files that
are now at hand until the last couple of days, and I am not
sure what is in the files for the public record, and what of
the materials I have been shown.in the last couplé of days since
I got back are still under seal...So just out of memory I am
going to summarize certain activities which have been acknowledged
that the Bureau undertook, but without being specific with: respe¢t
to location and names, and I do it for this reason, It is
right that the Committee and the press be worried about the
treatment of a Nobel Prize winner, Dr. King. i"

of the files show had violence done to their First Amendment
rights. And Nobel Prize winners will always get protection,
but Joe Potatoes doesn't, and this Committee should focus on
him, too.

Now, included in this COINTEL were activities like this,
anonymous letters, drafted by Bureau offices in the field, sent
to headquarters in Washington, approved, and then put~ in the
mail, intended to break up marriages, not of Dr. King but of
Mary and John Jones because one or the other was thought to be

letters to university officials and to the several newspapers

anonymous letter was sent to me making protest. Being an
anonymous letter, it never occurred to me that it came from the

bounds when they were approved by the Bureau??

Mr. Adams. Well, I think even under the guidelines of
COINTELPRO, as established, the programs were not designed for

the purpose of harrassment of an individual. The memoranda

of the turn downs were turned down on this specific wording.
This is mere harrassment.

. The rationale would have been -- and of course, here, I
say some of these you mentioned wouldn't even appear to me to
meet the criteria of the program and should have been disavowed,
even under the existence of the program. However, in the total
eae of the program activities were to be directed towards
the organization itself, but we do not do that at the present
time.

. Senator Hart of Michigan. Yes, but everything I have

summarized, rather poorly, was approved by the Bureau at the

time by headquarters, not by the field office agents.

Mr. Adams. I do think that there were improper actions
taken under the program, even under the program as it existed.
Mr. Kelley has so stated his recognition of that fact. The
Attorney General certainly has. Yet the majority of the actions

taken, even the Department concluded were lawful and legal,

[proper investigative activities, but the --

Senator Hart of Michigan. You see, my feeling is it isn't
a question of techniques that are bad. The concept of the
program ae to Bot iotenee to the First Amendment because
everything you did sought to silence someone or threaten
somebody to silence, or deny somebody a platform, or create an
atmosphere in which people were in fact afraid oe assemble.

‘Now, sometimes law enforcement, legitimate law enforcement
has what we call this chilling effect, when'it is legitimate
law enforcement. Oftentimes that chilling effect is a necessary
though regretable ‘side effect. But what I am talking about,
and what these files are full of are actions the. only purpose
of which is to chill. It isn't in pursuit of any. crime at all.
Indeed, when a court of general jurisdiction approved the use
of that university premise for the.use of the speaker. the
Bureau had .stirred:.so much controversy with its anonymous
letters, when that judge wrote cotder .after the sponsoring
group went to court, what was -the Bureau's reaction from

headquarters? Investigate the judge.

Mr. Adamsy-.I'm not familiar with that fact.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, neither was I until last
night.

Mr. Adams. the instruction was to investigate the judge?

Senator Hart of Michigan. This is the kind of stuff that
I came out of the hospital to find, and it is the sort of thing,
as I said yesterday, that my children have been telling me for
years you were busy doing, and I simply didn't believe them.
And they were right and I am wrong.

Mr. Adams. Well, there were about 3200 activities, and
about 2300 I believe or.so were approved under the COINTELPRO,
and over 59 percent were addressed .to the Communist Party. That
leaves 1000. And out.of 1000, perhaps, I don't: know what the
actual .figure was of .ones.that.just-clearly stand out as

improprietous under the .program,. .even as it-existed at the

-time, but I do feel.that --.well, it is.a.very.difficult area.

continues.to be that any -socially active group of citizens
who organize, whether Women's".libbers .or .fight the bomb or
anything else, might bea target -for infiltration by the

means, almost not as.an overstatement, that any and every citizen

activity could be made the target of the kind of business that

I have just described, because every individual is apt, during
his lifetime, to engage in violence. If that is justification,
then you are justified in running tails on everybody.

Mr. Adams. Well, that was not --

Senator Hart -of Michigan. Everybody has got--that' privilege
and that clearly is a police state concept.

Mr. Adams. That is not our criteria.

Senator Hart of Michigan. All right, but if the criteria
is three or four of us get together and we have a sort of
nutty idea, just the kind of thing the Communists would like to
exploit, and therefore you seek to justify shutting off the
forum for that group or to surveille it, the pdtential for

Communist intrusion, then, if that continues to be your theory,

then I. say you are, you are going to pursue the same wretched

road that these files show you have been pursuing before. If
that is the predicate, the.fact.that a Soviet or Marxist or
Maoist Hottentot is liable to.think there is .an idea that we
can exploit,.then you -people.are.going.to.be.spending how many

Mr. Adams. It ‘“does-not, and it is not our criteria, no

Senator Hart of Michigan. What does it justify?

. Mr. Adams, It justifies our doing nothing in the way of

COINTELPRO activities. I still feel it has a justification,

| that you agree with,to investigate the Communist Party. It is

when you get into the disruptive areas where the program goes
beyond investigation that we have no statutory authority.

of people think we should. We organize .and .you..people say,

strife -- perhaps I shouldn't say what was the purpose -~ what
possible justification for the Bureau trying to sick the Black
Panthers on that outfit call the US out in California, or between
the Black Panthers and the Blackstone Rangers in Chicago? Was
it with the hope that by fomenting it they would kill each other
off? e

Mr. Adams. Absolutely not, and I think the Committee
staff can inform you that during their review of all of these
matters they haven't come up with one instance of violence
resulting from any of these actions, and in that “particular
case there was a communication in the same file which I believe
the staff had access to which showed that we did get information
that one of these groups was going to put out a contract on one
of the, others,. and we notified the police and the individuals

of the fact that their life was in dangers

None of .ocur programs have. contemplated violence,, and

recommended actions.in some.instances specifically say that

we .do not approve.this.action because if we take it it could

result-in.harm.to.the individual....... i

So I think this is one.charge --.and the staff did not
make such a charge, I might add, when they presented the pictur:
put I think any inference that we were trying to result in
violence is wrong.

why I reached the conclusion I did..
Mr. Adams. The- wording of that memorandum --

_Senator Hart of Michigan. And why I continue to hold to

that conclusion. ee

on January 30th, 1969, the Bureau headquarters in Washington
approved sending an anonymous letter to the leader of the
Blackstone Rangers, Jeff Forky, which indicated that the Black
Panthers had put a contract out on his life 7 a result of
conflicts between the two organizations. Now, you say that was
to warn him. :

I ask, wasn't the principal purpose of the letter to
encourage the Rangers to shoot some or all of the leadership
of the panthers? Otherwise, what does this quote mean, and I
will read it, It is from ‘a memorandum from the .Chicago office
of the Bureau asking approval to undertake this. Here is the
way it reads:: "It is believed that the above" this anonymous
tip that a contract .is.out.on you, "It.is believed that -the-
above may.intensify the degree of animosity bet cs the two
groups .and occasion. Forky to.take retaliatory actions which
could disrupt:-the_BPP, the Black Panthers, or’ lead to
reprisals against its .leadership. . Consideration has .been
given oe similar letter to the. Panthers alleging a Ranger
plot against Panther leadership. However, it is not felt ‘that
this will be productive, principally because the Panthers at

present is not believed as violence prone as the Rangers, * >

nature." peed cetseteleeiteteeeeiteaict?

Now, how, can you xeach any conclusion other than a purpose
was to generate the kind of friction that would induce the
killing -- :

Mr. Adams. Well, if that purpose was for that rather than
generating factionalism, disagreements, disrupting it, it would
be contrary to the communication I referred to in the other
file, the Black Panthers versus Ellis, where we notified the
police of the contract, we notified the individuals ‘of the
contract and took every action at our command to prevent
direct violence, and also the fact that the files showéd ‘that

we turned down these situations where violence was involved.

This memo, as you know, received the following comment

I would just quote part of the language and maybe you

The first part-of the ‘memo says: "We have got to remove

left without a national leader of sufficiently compelling

what could happen but nesd not happen if the right kind of

Senator Mondale. Mr. Adams, I am trying to gat at the
legal basis in this particular casé in investigating Dr.
Ring on the grounds. that he might be subject to Communist
influence.

_Can_you cite any legal basis for that or is it based

entirely upon a generalized authority thought to exist in

Mr. Adams, Ie would fall also in the Presidéntial
directives of investigating subversive activities.

Senator Mondale. And then the question would return :
to what authority the President had.

Mr. Adams. That's right.

Senator Mondale. Now Dr. King was investigated among
other things for matters of, I think you call it delicacy.

Would that be a basis for investigating an American
citizen by the FBI?

Mr. Adams. No, -

Senator Mondale. Would you say then that those
investigations were improper?

ees -I don't believe that there is an allegation
that we investigated him for that. I think there were
certain by-products of information that developed and I think
at a point you had a situation where the tail was wagging
the dog, perhaps, but I don't see any basis ‘for such investi-
gation. and I find it very difficult to get into a discussion
of this in’ view of the prohibitions that I think --

senator Mondale. You answered my aout! That for
itself would not be a basis for investigation.

“Mr. ‘Adams, ‘No, sir.

Senator Mondale. “Would you agree with me, Mr. Adams,
that this whole: vague, generalized area of the assignment
that the FBI has been tasked, which they thought they possessed}.
or could use to investigate Americans, not where there were

allegations of crime or suspicion that crimes were about to

be committed, or that violence-was about to be committed,
but rather this whole generalized area, to investigate

americans in terms of ideas that they have or might be persuade!

to have that might hold potential for danger to this country
is an exceedingly vague, difficult, Lf not impossible to
define aréa and an area which has got the FBI into an awful
lot of peerineile including today's hearings.

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mondale. And because of that there is a very
important need alae down and redefine it, have the guidelines
known specifically by all sq that the FBI can. know precisely
what it can do and what it cannot do. i

Mr. Adams. I think this is why the. country is’ fortunate
in this particular time. to have an Attorney General who is
a legal scholar and a lawyer of ueeuseei ced repute who
has indicated a willingness to addréss these problems, which
as the staff has. determined, was not always the: case over
the years. But we have an eae General, we have a
Diréctor, who has offered his complete cooperation, just as
he has to the Committee in this inquiry, that ee not

to hold back are identities of informants’ and sensitive,

- Mr. Adams. We might have to investigate, but to disrupt,
we have the authority. to tell the supervisor of the waterworks,
you had better get him out of: there before the city water is
poisoned and 100,000 people die, and I think the Committee is
going to find the same problems we do in coping with that
situation, and even the Attorney General in his speech in Ottawa
pointed out that there is still possibly a necessity for some
flexibility to take appropriate action under extreme conditions.
But it should be controlled. It is like Mr. Kelley Save! go
to the Attorney General, explore the legal issues, lay the
problem up there. It should not be handled internally in the
FBI. : , i

Senator Mondalé. But do you also agree ‘that the Congress
ought to redefine the rules legislatively?

Mr. Adams. Yes, because the problem -I have with it is
we talk about oversight, and Mr. Kelley and the Attorney Genera. :

oversight which would avoid _the.proliferation of .hearings

Until it is embodied in legislation where the whole will

Senator Mondale. I am glad to hear ee because there is
a way Congress ‘speaks. It is not through the buddy system or
a person. It speaks through the law.

Mr. Adams. That!s right.

Senator Mondale. And now we have for thé first time this
whole issue, it~is not denied by the FBI. The elements are
known. What I hear you saying is you would like the Congress
now to define and redefine specifically and carefully what it

is we expect the FBI to do, and what it is we wish the FBI and

will prohibit the FBI from doing.

Mr. Adams. Right. What is-.our role in society?

After World War II, if you'll-remember, a Congressional
" Committee met -and raised-all sorts of storm. over the fact that
there was not enough -in..the way of intelligence. investigations.
Never again .should .it. happen in the United States that we be
caught with our -pants down...

After the Kennedy assassination, if you recall, the FBI
was properly criticized for having too restrictive dissemination

policies in connection with Secret Service because they depend

upon us for the intelligence necessary to provide protection.

just before ‘the recent incidents in California there was going

So ‘the FBI is in the position of at different times in our

too little. And it is because of reacting to what we try to
judge is what they want us to do, and this is what we are not
in a position to do. We need the will of Congress expressed in

to-being a critic of the Warren Commission?

What standard do we use when we just pass photographs of
sexual activities to the White House? Is this a normal ~~ again|,
is this a normal proceeding when a dossier is requested? Is eae
included, oe did they specifically request photographs of this
kind, or what light can you shed on this?

Mr. Adams. I can't shed much.~- I know they requested
information on him. I think. there was other material concerning
that individual of a security nature that was included. Why
the information in that respect was submitted I am unable to
answer. : - ae

I do know at the time there was a lot of concern following

the Warren Commission Report, had all the answers been explored,|
was the Soviet Union involved, was Cuba involved, ‘and who were
the critics who now are attacking this. But . have: seen
nothing which would explain the rationale for requesting the
material.

~- 11 Would you differ with that or dispute that, or again,

12 what rationale? Do wé use sexual activities as a standard

WARD & PAUL,

ya | Mr. Adams. We do not use sexual activities asa criterion,
but during the course of our investigation -- we aid have an
16 investigation on that individual at one time -- and during
WW the course. of the investigation, in checking the records ofa
“18 local police department or. a district. attorney's office, they

to add, however, that following the cleansing effect of Watergat

that I don't know of any.such requests coming over to the FBI

anymore. ane

There is a direct line between the Attorney General and
the Director, and the Director certainly recognizes that ina
case of extreme Fe unisennitye he would have the alternative to
tell the Attorney General, I need to go directly to the Presiden)
or feel I should, but we do not have this line of communication
at the present time. cen

Sénator Schweiker. Well, it-seems to me if they had just
listed the.other. investigation and listed what was alleged
in the other investigation, that certainly would have sufficed
for whatever purpose it-would have. _ But it seemsi:to me when
you in fact enclose living photographs, you are really getting
very much, to my way of thinking, towards attempting to.
discredit their critics. What other purpose. would a Chou ee
have of this nature. other than to discredit critics because
they will not quarrel with listing whatever we charged in
another state. That may well have been included. I cannot
argue that.

Mr. Adams. I can’t answer that.

Senator Schweiker. One area that I think this gets to
which we really touched on in the assassination probe quite a

bit, Mr. Adams, is where the Bureau stops when they get some

of these requests, in other words, what kind of criteria, if

any. You touched on it a moment ago. The President asked for

something. I don't know in this case whether the President

asked to see photographs of this nature or didn't ask, but the
point is, nobody said no and he got them.

So the question is, where do you see the Bureau's responsi-|
bility here, and what can this Committee do to ensure that
there is some kind of a test that we either put in the law
or that the FBI invokes, or that we invoke on the White House
in using police power in this way?

Mr. Adams. I don"t think Congress can ever fill the
responsibility of trying -+to-draw up guidelines, even in conjunc~
tion with the Executive Branch, to guarantee that all abuses
won't take place. The organhization-is made up of human beings,
and aan things occur.

Certain corrective actions are self-initiated, such as
this. The President, for instance, you.know we had an incident
a few years ago about investigating.a newsman, where we were
requested, and if I recall from our. information, we thought he
was being considered for an appointed position which would have
been a logical basis. As facts turned out, that'was not the
purpose that the information was requested.

fo stem or stop abuses like that, the President, the
current Administration has issued instructions that any requests

for investigations under the special inquiry or White House

investigation such as for appointment must clear through the

office of his counsel, in other words, not let the lower line

people_come over and say we need this information or we need
this request. They come through the office of Phil Buchen_
through an employee that is assigned to that office with
responsibility. im

Now, we do still make certain name check::requests for the
White. House, and those, too, have to cio through his office.
So we do have that. Then we have the responsibility, if we
get something which on its face appears political°or improper,
then our responsibility under that would be to go to the
Attorney General and ask -him-to intercede by finding out is
this a proper request on the Bureau. And I can assure you that
as Mr. Kelley has testified and has made it perfectly clear
that he has not had any such improper requests and he would
go right to the Attorney General if it was necessary. Otherwise
he would reject the request.

Senator Schweiker. What steps are we taking, under your
jurisdiction comes whatever internal investigation unit the
FBI has. I.just wondered very briefly, because I know my
time is very limited, we have.a vote on, what steps are you
taking to make sure that we catch some of these things in the
present that maybe we either overlooked or did not catch or
somehow got sidetracked in the past?

was there, to’ look at all of our procedures, all of our

eriteria, do we have a‘legal basis for them, and we have guide-
lines, committees which have been established in the Department
that meet every day on.questions of what is even an overwhelming
problem of collection and maintenance of information. What

do we get, why do we get it, what should we do with it.

-I feel there is a very active program going on in that
regard, and I feel certain that it will continue to make sure
that we are aware of everything and take ‘appropriate action.

“.- Senator Schweiker... I wonder if.you might share some of
these with the staff so that we can have an advantage of taking
a look at those, too. I am glad to’see this being made.

Mr. Adams.’ I would have to secure’the approval of the
Attorney General on the guidelines. He did tell the House
Committee which originally raised the question on maintenance |
information, that once we get something and they are nearing
completion in the Department, that he does intend to take it
up with Congress. So I am sure there would be no problem at
that point .in bringing it to this Committee.as well.

Senator Schweiker. Because .it.seems to me this is where
the problems in the past have arisen, in not having clearly
defined or maybe if you measure it -- you can measure it in
terms of today's standards versus standards of before, but I

think this is the crux of it.

ace Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

.First I think to keep this activity in proper perspective
it might be well to remember that even though a great deal of
the testimony and the. questioning has been relating to the
situation. Dr. King's case is indeed a classic example utilizing

all of the various techniques of the Bureau’ in both intelligencd-

gathering an action against an individual in order to dis-~
credit him or embarrass him,-or indeed destroy him.
But the record is replete, and indeed, here is an entire

sheaf of similar targets who are certainly not as well known.

high, school teachers, college students, college teachers,
broadcasters and journalists, people whose names would be almost
totally.unfamiliar. to. the. vast. majority. of. peeiccns So the.
activity was not.confined.to those that are immediately
recognizable who were indeed public-figures.

I want to just proceed along the question of informants

that Senator Tower just raised for just a moment or two.

You say that your informants are not expected to do anything
that an agent himself could not do, but in the gathering of the
do you have any safeguard at all, or any rule as to how he

for? :
.. Mr. Adams. Only that he proceed through legal means.
Senator Huddleston. Is that specifically stated to him

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Huddleston, Are most_informers paid on the

on the basis of the information they gather?

Mr. Adams. Even those who are paid on what you could say
a salary, that salary is determined on a COD basis as to the
value of the information furnished... In other words, in the
criminal case, for instance, you teats have a person come an and

give you the identity of.three individuals who just robbed a

bank. You might pay him a lump sum amount, and never go back

to him.
In the security field where informants do finally canage

to work into a ire eal type organization, their

for payment.

of information that may-be supplied to you if it happens to be
of a sensational nature or of a surprising nature, do you ever
question the informer on how he obtained it?

Mr. Adams, I am sure this takes place. In any handling
of an informant over a sustained period of time, you do have a
rapport which they don't just come in and say Joe Blow said
this, Joe Blow did that. There is a conversation that goes
through which I feel certain would, if something looked like,

if it looked like he had something that came from some improper

source, I think the agent would say-where did you get this.

Mr. Adams, Wo, sir, we do not.

Senator Huddleston. What internal precautions do you

have against the Bureau itself misusing information that it

gains from other agencies?

Mr. Adams. Strong prohibitions. One, we don't allow

access to files except on a need-to-know basis. Any employee

of the FBI knows that if he improperly divulges information

or leaks information out of the ‘files, he will be subject

>
to administrative action.
We had a case where an agent obtainéd an identification

record: and made it out improperly, and I think that agent

was separated from the roles. But we had asked for, and of

course we share in CIA's request to this extent, is that there

be a criminal penalty attached to misuse of information and
leaking it or making it available outside of an agency. .

. *This is another issue before Congress.

Did this in fact happen to your knowledge?

Mr. Adams. I am not familiar with that case, ©

happened or whether the act.was carried out?
= Mr..Adams. I do not know. =
Senator Huddleston. Mr. “Adams, getting on to another
subject, on& of the techniques used vary frequently by’ the
Bureau in its See aapel to discredit individuals was to

on many occasions to editors, broadcasters, commentators and

columnists around the country containing information or

suggesting information about an individual that the Bureau
wanted to discredit in some -way.

There was also some evidence ‘that the Bureau utilized
within the press itself on a regular contact basis certain.
columnists or broadcasters for the purpose of disseminating
information that the FBI wanted to get out about individuals.

How extensive was this custom utilized?

Mr. Adams. I don't believe it was vary axtensive.

In fact, I think there ‘were probably very few incidents where
untrue information was put. out. |

That is my recollection.

On disseminating public source information there were
Peres of instances of that which is still ‘proper to date
under guidelines. I just don't know of many instances: where

untrue information was used, and I do not know of too many

regard, I know there have been situations where, and people

Senator Huddleston. Is it also to suppress other
publications or other commentators or journalists who might
be disseminating other views?

against a number of newspapers, most of them student newspapers
that they felt should be suppressed?

some background information on him which would have been in
the area of public source material which he could use in an
article.

One of the great freedoms we have is the freedom of

For what purpose have they been kept and has the Bureau ever
undertaken to destroy or prune down any of these records?.

Mr, Adams. We have a number of records. We are
a business-like. organization. We record our activities, y And
as the staff knows, they had access to a lot of recorded
material that is the product of what the FBI has done over
the years.

i VWhen we conduct an investigation, we maintain ‘the
results. We do have destruction procedures where after the
passage of certain time limits approved by the Archives
authority, we are allowed to destroy certain files. Other
information we are required to put on microfilm. Theres is
a regular standard procedure for the destruction of FBI
“files. This has been.suspended, of course, during the
initiation of these hearings and our files probably have
increased considerably during this period because we are not
allowed to destroy anything since the Committee Sone ee
its hearings.

But we do have procedures for destroying these that
are approved by the Archives, and a problem inherent in that
is maintaining information, what should we keep, what should
we obtain during an investigation, what should we record?

In the past we have ver pretty consistent in recording
everything we peer was relevant to the investigation. The

passage of the Privacy Act put certain restrictions in. We

But beyond even the Privacy Act, the Attorney General
instituted a guidelines committee in this area that we have

that the Bureau in March of 1968 developed information to
be. given to the press criticizing Dr. King for staying in
a white~owned and oeiecd hotel, the Holiday Inn in Memphis,
instead of the Lorraine. ;

At some point during Dr. King's stay in Memphis, he
moved from the Holiday Inn to Lorraine.

To Pees knowledge, Mr. Adams, was that information ever
given to the press?

Mr. Adams. I have been unable to determine that. This
question was raised of me by the Civil Rights Division of the
Department. Apparently, they had had some inquiry along

the same lines several months ago. “But my recollection of it

at the time, we saw that this action had been proposed and
the memorandum bore the initials, I believe it was the
initials, statement handled, and the initials of the agent
in the External Affairs Division who assumed the responsibility
of saying handle it and initiated it.. ;

They contacted him and he said that he had no recollection
of the matter but the fact that he did oy handled didn't
mean that he was able to do anything with it. He was just
clearing: that memorandum so it would show action was taken,
and he doesn't know ‘We he gave it to anyones or not.

Mr. Adams. Thare was Soe statement in the local papers,
not ania to the terminology of the proposed statement that
was to be given'to him. There was some comment made, if I
recall, that Martin Luther King gave a press conference
following the riots that followed one of his appearances,
and that he gave that press conference in a hotel, the Holiday
Inn Hotel. But it didn't have any, at least the newspaper
article itself didn't have any direct. relation to acts taken.

: Senator Hart of Colorado. Well, according to soms
historians and, paople who have commented on the circumstances,
they were fairly explicit in stating that the local press

was critical: of him during that period for staying in the
white hotel, but I don't want to make a big fe out of
that.

What was the name of the agent that you talked to?

Mx. Adams. I didn't talk to him personally. People in
the Bureau that were working on this did and I believe his
name was Linbaugh, pe oe eee

_ Mr. Adams. They did have a definition of the New Left
distinguishing it from the Old Left. It was primarily to dis-
tinguish it from the, in the area that ‘the New Left was trying
to separate itselé from the old hidebound policies of the
Communist Party or some of its links to the Communist Party.

Perhaps Mr. Wannall has a better definition of that.

Senator Hart of Colorado. It very definitely included those
who were opposed to the war, organized groups that opposed the
war and felt strongly about racial injustice in this country,
leaving the Communist Party aside.

Mr. Adams. People involved in the New Left movement were,
of course, also ieee in the Vietnam, anti-Vietnam was
effort.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What do you mean also?

That's what I'm trying to get out. What was the New
Left? If you didn't oppose the war and you weren't involved in
civil rights groups, who else might you have been?

Mr. Adams. Well, the New Left’ was a -- did involve a
revolutionary philosophy. It wasn't related solely to the
anti-Vietnam effort.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Thomas Jefferson embodied a
revolutionary philosophy.

Mr. Adams. That's right. And the New Left activity
exceeded -Thomas Jefferson's philosophy in that it did fit in

with the basic Communist philosophy.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Every group that was placed unde!

the efforts of the COINTELPRO supported the violent overthrow
of this country?

Mr. Adams. The concept of COINTELPRO was directed toward‘
those organizations. I would have to refresh my memory on each
one of the organizations that were targets of it, but they were
basically New Left, Communist Party, Socialist Workers Party,
New Left, black extremists, white hate groups, those were the
five basics.

Senator Hart of Colorado. The Southern Christian Leader-

Mr. Adams. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

_I don't know if it was involved specifically in COINTELPRO.

Three minor actions were taken against the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.

Senator Hart of Colorado. well, its. leader; .I™think you
could say, for eight years was subject to a lot more than three
minor actions.

Mr. Adams. That's right, and that gets into the other
area that the activities taken against him were primarily
COINTELPRO type activities but weren't really under the control

e@ i 2 Mr. Adams. Well, not just the violent overthrow of the
: 3 3 government. It would have been organizations that were threaten

4 ing and fomenting violence. JI..don't believe it had to be,
5 related to the actual overthrow of the government.

6 Senator Hart of Colorado. Is a street demonstration
7 || violent?

8 Mr. Adams. It depends on where you are in relation to

9 what is taking place. If there are a lot of activities in

10 || connection with street demonstrations that are not violent,

ji || and there are a lot of street demonstrations that have reported
1g || in deaths, so it just depends on activity taking place and

13 || the circumstances.

WARD & PAUL

14 Our problem is we are given the responsibility by the

15 || Attorney General to monitor demonstrations which have the

16 potential of violence. The question is, how do you find pie

19 Senator Hart of Colorado. Well,.obviously what we're

21 || that the FBI went out of.its.way to foment violence itself,
- 22 || to encourage disruptions internally, to encourage hostilities

Mr. Adams. I accept the allegation but °I don't accept the
fact, the conclusion that, from what I have seen in reviewing
these files in connection with our investigations, we don!t
foment violence. We don't permit as a matter of policy our
informants to act as provocateurs to engage in violence. I am
not denying it may have happened, but the FBI does not foment
violence, and the FBI, you know, has no --

Senator Hart of Colorado. You are using present .tetise
verbs. --I think --

Mr. Adams. We didn't then. I don't agree that our action:
in any dire supa designed to foment violence.

Senator Hart of Colorado. I think there is plenty of
documentation of the attempt to set the Black Panthers against
the Blackstone Rangers in Chicago. ae

Mr. Adams. Well, I don't.consider that..plenty of evidence.
I think. the evidence to.the contrary is that one of the.
organizations, when we got word that the Black Panther versus
US, we notified the local police that..this activity was going
to take place, and.the individual, so that we would prevent.
the killing which had come to our attention was going to take
place, and then the turndowns of various COINTELPRO actions,
there were specific statements made, that will not be
approved because it might result in harm to an individual,

physical harm, and we have no indication from any of these

actions under COINTELPRO that any violent act occurred, and I
have noe been presented with any by the staff from their far
more extensive inquiry.

Senator Hart of Colorado. June 3rd, 1968, a memorandum
from the Special Agent in Charge of Cincinatti to the Director
of the FBI, the title of which is Counterintelligence Program,
Disruption of the New Left, a five page memorandum having to
do with Antioch College in Ohio. It is a long description of
the college and background. There is a recommendation on page
3, Cincinatti recommends that counterintelligence action be
taken to expose-the pseudo-intellectual image of Antioch, and i
gives specific ways of doing that, and then the next page,
page 4, the desired result of action, force Antioch to

defend itself as an educational institution.

Where in the laws of this country or the charter of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation does it.say that that eee
should.be forcing.any educational institution to defend itself?

Mr. Adams. .I know of none.

Senator Hart of Colorado. You would say this is stepping
-beyond .the bounds .of your authority?

Mr. Adams. I would say -- I'm not familiar with the total
action of what was there, but just on the surface I don't see
any basis for it.

COINTELPRO activities were required to send in status letters
and report in annual results.

Is that correct?

Mr. Adams. Yes. if

Senator Hart of Colorado. What kind of results generally
were you looking for? What was considered success? :

Mr. Adams. Well, it would be considered success, like
in one instance where an action was taken to create factionalism

in the highest level of the Communist Party, and the results

were that we were advised that the Communisty Party influence
declined appreciably as a direct result of factionalism created
at that level. That to us was a concrete result.

We had other results where, well, you get in various
degrees. That is an extremely favorable degree. We had others

went on setting. up.a marital. strife. on. the. part of. someone.

: The only thing that I feel is we had 3000 actions
recommended. The Bureau -- just like this Antioch one. I
don't know if the document shows whether that was approved or
not. I doubt that it was approved. :

Senator Hart of Colorado. I believe it was. We can

document that.

Mr. Adams. Okay. Because there would be one. I would
say the judgment in approving that is in question. But out
of 3000 recommended, the fact that 2000 approved shows that
there was some concern to try to.keep these to a proper level,
and I think the actual number of grossly improper activities
fortunately is rather small. I think there are a lot in there.

Well, “the whdle program, we feel, should have been dis-
continued, and we don't have a program like it now, and we
wouldn't institute a program like it now.

Senator Hart of Colorado. It would be helpful to us if
now or in the future you could recommend what steps we should
take, both as the Committee and this Congress, to make sure
that doesn't happen, aside from just the assurances we are bein
given here.

Mr. Adams. Well, the’ main recommendation I make is that
we don't wind up on the point we have been.an in the Bead
years that one time in. our history. Congress. is saying we ought
to be doing. something to stop. violence in the streets, murders,

blowing up.of buildings,.and at another. time they are saying

| you shouldn't have done. what you did, and that we make a

mistake when we react and try to identify one area and say that
is the voice of the people. What we need is a legislative
mandate which is the will of Congress in order to tell us what
our role should be in this area. I think that is the main

thing that would come out of all of these, I hope, some more

business of informants which I initiated and was interrupted
by a vote, who selects an informant?

Mr. Adams. The basic responsibility is on our special

Senator Tower. Does the Special Agent in Charge in a given

area have control over the activities of an informant or a veto

on the use of a particular informant?

Mr. Adams. Not only the Special Agent in Charge, but FBI
headquarters. We maintain the tightest possible control of the
utilization of informants. We require Bureau approval to utilige
a person as an informant.

Senator Tower. The Special Agent in Charge has the power
to veto the use of an informant? eee

Senator Tower. Are the criteria different for paid.and
for non-paid informers?

Mr. Adams. We have some informants over the years that have
refused to accept payment, but generally the criteria for
both, I mean for ones that are paid is that it must be ona
COD basis, evaluated as to the value of the information.

Senator Tower. What protections are afforded to

Mr. Adams. Protections afforded them individually?

Senator Tower. Yes.

Mr. Adams. The greatest protection in the world we can
afford them is to maintain the confidential relationship which
they have adopted with the FBI, and the fact that those citizen:
of the United States who, for whatever reason, decide to
cooperate with the FBI and cooperate with their government
in criminal and the security fiela, have that .confidentiality .

maintained, and beyond that confidentiality we are unable ta:

afford them any protection,. any physical protection. We have
had informants murdered through disclosure. We have had them
subjected. to. other. violence. and. criminal. activities, and the
only. protection beyond maintaining the confidentiality is once
we have. used. them or. had. to. expose. them. for. some. purpose, we
do. have. procedures. for. relocation. and. maintenance. of. them which
is. utilized. quite. frequently in the top hoodlum and the Cosa

Senator Tower.. It is.my understanding now that 83 percent
of all: cases involve. some. use. of. informants,-so that means that
the use is. pretty.widespread. and. apparently very essential.

Wee kind. of. guidance. does the. FBI: give.to these informants
to give them any special training? Could you describe that kind
of.relationship in terms of guidelines, control, authority,
what have you?

Mr. Adams. Well, when an individual is being developed

as an informant, our main concern is whether he provides

,reliable information and that the information he collects is

collected by legal means. We don't permit an informant to
engage in any activity that an agent couldn't do legally
himself. In other words, you can't have an extension of the
agent out here engaging in illegal acts, and the agent saying
Tr abide by the law. This creates some problems, of course,
in the criminal field where you don!t.¥recruit informants from
Sunday schools. You recruit-informants-in areas where. they do
have knowledge of criminal Seer cee But we even had to
open. investigations: and prosecute some of. our informants, be-
cause: we do. not. bend from this,. that they. are: not going to
enjoy favorite. status. as. a. result.of their. relationship. with

us.- So.the agent covers all of this with an informant during

. the. discussions...

We. secure. background. information on. the. informants. We

do this to ensure, as best as possible, we are dealing with a

them more or less, in different terminology, probationary,
potential, verifying information: that he furnishes us, and
everytime when they report on the status of an informant, they |

have to tell us what percentage of his information has been

So we do have a continuing indoctrination which is
supervised at FBI headquarters.

Senator Tower. You said you don't recruit your informants
from Sunday school class. Being an ex-Sunday school teacher, I
resent that, but --

Mr. Adams. I am talking in the criminal field. Many of
our security informants come from a very fine background.

Senator Tower. But this leads me into this. Sometimes,
then, you might recruit people that you know have committed
criminal acts.

Mr. Adams. That's true.

Senator Tower. Do you promise him immunity from future

next level, and in some of these cases we have gone up through
successive stages until we get the main honcho who we feel is

FBI still request bank audits?

cases a bank will make available to us records without subpoena.
When it comes time for utilizing that information we do igsue
a subpoena for the information.

Senator Tower. Do you have.legal authority to gain.
access to these records? i

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir, we do.

Senator Tower. Without a subpoena, without a court
document?

Mr. Adams. There is no law that I know of that forbids
us access. There have been several court decisions, including
some circuit courts that disagree with each other, but I think
the current finding is that the bank records are the ‘records
of the bank and this does not violate any First Amendment or
other Amendments in connection with it.

Senator Tower. Do you make similar requests of S&Ls and
other, and credit unions and other financial institutions?

Mr. Adams. I would assume the same would provide there.

The Chairman (presiding). Thank you, Senator Tower.

I just have a. question or two. We are going to try to
conclude this morning because the Committee has a hearing, a
business meeting at 2:00 o'clock this afternoon and for the
information of the members, that meeting will take place in

room 3110 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.

and 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon, the Committee will report
its findings and make its recommendations to-the Senate in
connection with our investigation into alleged involvement of
the United States in certain assassination plots, and senses
directed against foreign leaders.

The Committee, as you know, has made an exhaustive investi
gation of this issue. It has taken some six months; 75. eee
have been interrogated, over 8000 pages of testimony have been
taken, mountains of documents me been analyzed and digested,
and the report will be a detailed accounting to the American
people of that evidence, together with the findings and
recommendations of the Committee.

Initially these disclosures will be made to the Senate in
secret session, after which the Committee has previously voted
to make -the report public. Therefore, it is anticipated that

at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in this room,. the caucus room,

following that secret session.of the Senate, the Committee will

meet with the press for the purpose of. answering such
questions as the press may wish to address to the Committee on
the assassination report.

Now, the last few questions I would like to put to you,

Mr. Adams, have to do with some confusion in my mind concerning

the purpose of the FBI in monitoring the Women's Liberation

movement, what was that? what was that, surveillance done for?

Why were you involved in monitoring that movement?

Mr. Adams. It was basically, as I recall, I have not

investigation was based_or_initiated on this fact.

The Chairman. But you never found, did you, that the
Women's Liberation movement was seriously infiltrated, influenced
or controlled by Communists.

Mr. Adams. No, and the case was closed. I would put them
in the position of comments we have made earlier about the
press, that I don't think anyone is going to dominate or controll.
That is a very independent group.

The Chairman. Well, we are trying to keep the country that
way.

Mr. Adams. That's right.

The Chairman. And the kind of thing that disturbs me

you have the document book there with you. If you will turn
to Tab 5, 5-4, can you find that? Can you move your thumb

Origin, Aims, and Purposes, a description of the Women's
Liberation movement in Baltimore, Maryland.

Now, I call your attention to this because it seems to me
to typify the whole problem. of this generalized kind of
surveillance over activities of American citizens. Here is
the report, if you will read with me this paragraph, the
report on the group reads as follows: "The Women's Liberation
movement in Baltimore, Maryland began during the summer of
1968. There was no structure or a parent organization. . There
were no rules or plans to go by. It started out as a group
therapy session with young women who were either lonely or
confined to the home with small children, getting together to
talk out their problems. Along with this they wanted a
purpose and that was to be free women from the humdrum
existence of being only a wife and mother. They wanted
equal opportunities that men have in work and in poctety | They
wanted their husbands to share in the housework and in rearing
their children. They also wanted to go out and work in whateve
kind of jobs they wanted, and not to be discriminated against
as women."

Now, can you. find anything in that report that in any way
suggests that these women were engaged in improper or unlawful
activity?. .
it Mr. Adams. Not in that one. I believe there was another

report, though, giving the origin of it, which went into a

The Chairman. I am reading from a document that relates’
to the Women's Liberation Movement in Baltimore, and the finding
concerning it in the summer of 1968. My question hasn't to do
with whatever original purpose the FBI sought by initiating
this kind of surveillance in New York, but with a finding
made concerning the Women's Liberation movement in Baltimore
which I have just: read to you, and I think you would agree with
me that women do have the right to get together to talk about
humdrum existence and equal opportunities with men and equal
opportunities for work in our society, don't they? That is
not a subversive activity.

Mr. Adams. Well, but what you have here is the setup of
our investigative activity. We had New York, which was the

office of origin of the investigation. You have other offices

that were checking to determine what influence there was.

.In addition, in New York, to the New York office, lay the fact

that interwoven. with. the Women's. Liberation movement goal for

equal rights for women, there was.an advocacy certainly of

militancy and violence in achieving their. goals.
Now, Baltimore is one office, and I believe that even
there in one of the reports --
“The Chairman. You keep taking me back to New York.
Mr. Adams. Right.

The Chairman. And I keep taking you back to Baltimore.

And the reason I do that is because if you turn two pages

back from this particular report, which has to do with the
Baltimore organization, the question is whether based upon that
finding the investigation should continue of the Baltimore -
group, and the decision is that you will continue to follow
and report on the activities of the group.

And I just wondered why --

Mr. Adams. This is a problem that we have, that we do
have organizations where sometimes the -- the Women's Liberation
group is not a good example because that was washed out, but

we do have organizations where --

The Chairman. What was washed out? Not the Women's
Liberation movement?

Mr. Adams. No, the investigation indicated there was
no concern or no reason to be concerned about it.

But where you do have an organization that has branches
in many areas of the country, and you start with one place and
it looks like you have a subversive organization, you do have
to see, well, is this carried. out. throughout the organization
or is it just one chapter.or one group? In other words, not
even an organizational problem..

The Chairman. But you see, in this -- the trouble with
that is in this Baltimore organization you say in your own

report that it was independent, there was no structure or

your own admission au

Mr. Adams. I believe this report had some subsequent
pages that aren't included in here that did show some additional|
activity or influence.

The Chairman. I am told by the staff that this summary is
accurate, and the only other thing contained was that these
women had affiliations with an organization that had protested
the war in Baltimore.

Mr. Adams. I think there were some other items.

The Chairman. That is the only other association that
we have been able to determine.

Now, in a case of this kind, do you still carry -- you say
this has been closed. Apparently the Women's Liberation move-
ment is no longer under suspicion by the FBI and the case has
been closed. What happens when the case is closed? Are those
women's names still left in. the files?

Are they forever more contained?

Mr. Adams. Yes.

The Chairman. In the system? Yes. There is no -- yes.

Mr, Adams. Yes.

The Chairman. Pretty soon you will have us all in the
system.

I mean, if there is no way, even after surveillance has
been terminated to terminate the eerateatee of individuals

through the files of the system, you will one day have us all,

Mr. Adams. Well, I would say as part of a normal business
record, when we do make a judgment that an organization should
be investigated and we investigate it, and then we find activitil
but we make a conclusion that there is no additional problem
here, this is a record of our official action. Now, if we
destroy it, at what point do we get into a situation of being
accused of doing things and then destroying things to keep from
showing what we do?

The critical thing on this is whether we are able, and we
do set up safeguards, where information in our files is not
misused at a later date, and that is what these guideline

committees are all about.

The Chairman, Do you have ae idea of how many names of
Americans you keep in your files all as a result of the
cumulative effect of all of these surveillances in all of
these cases? :

Mr. Adams, No, I don't. —

Tha Chairman, It's in the millions, isn't it?

Mr. Adams, We have 6 1/2 million files.

he Chairman. You have 6 1/2 million files?

Mr, Adams. Yes, sir.

The Chairman. And there are surely names of more than
one person typically in a file, aren't they?

Mr. Adams. But it is a rather large country.

The Chairman. That's a large number of files to start.
with, and if you have multiple names in them, you ars quickly
up in to the, you know, 20, 30, 40 million.

Me. Adams. Right. But many of these files ars
applicant files. They are not all subversive files. They are
not all criminal files. We have A million crimes of viclence
each year.

There is a million people.

The Chairman. Sure, and I wish you had more time to
spend on those crimes of violence.

Mr. Adams. I do too.

1831

The Chairman. What I worry about is this. You say there's
no way to know when to close a fila. These were surveillance
files, or originally opened up to determine whether organizations
might have subversive connections. ~ i : ee

There are names in these. Files, so some demagogue comes
along and says against some public figure that his name is
contained in a certain file to be found in the subversive
files of the FBI and there it is. Me has not made.a misstatenedt
at all. But to the American people that man's name and
reputation has been scarred.

Mr. Adams. And I hope this Committee recognizes that
and recommends legislation that would enforce strong punitive
or criminal violations against misuse of information in the
files, We ‘feel this way, erteies this way. We recognize
we have a lot of sensitive information in it. We fire our
employees if we find them misusing information. We feel
we need additional sanctions in this area.

I don't think we can ever stop the accumulation of
information, I don't know an investigative agency in the
world, a law enforcement agency, that does not have to
accumulate information. And we are working on guidelines
as to how to get rid of the irrelevant information, how to

sliminats material that really does not need to be kept,

guidelines before too long, which will help address itself

be working with you and the Department ‘of Justices and others
to try and change the laws.to give a greater measure of

Sénator Mondale?

Senator Mondale. Mr, Adams, earlier, in inquiring about
the basis for investigating Dr. King, I thought I heard two
pasic justifications. One, suspicion and fear of Communist
influence or infiltration, And secondly, "that he constituted -
a threat to the success of the Negro movement."

Did I understand that second basis?

Mr. Adams. No. The first I was talking about was not
suspicion but information indicating Communist influence.

The second was on this. question of motivation that you raised,
I don't know what their motive was to get to some of these
other activities in order to discredit and remove him, but it
was a question -- apparently, they must have felt that he

was a threat to either as shown in the files the president

and Attorney General expressed concern about the civil rights

movement and“his continued affiliation with some of these

people.

Senator Mondale... Would you agree that it would not be
a proper basis for an investigation for the FBI or any other
Goes anaes official to be concerned about the success of the
negro movement? Redatecedttcttuistiad

In other words, that. is not a valid --

Mr. Adams. I have no problem.

Pattee Mondale. All right. So let us take the one
ground that appears to have justified the investigation of
Dr. King and thé investigation of the women's liberation
movement -- the fear that "dangerous influences might
infiltrate these organizations."

Suppose itis true. Suppose that a Communist did
have influence over Dr. King, or suppose an SDS member
infiltrated and became a dominant influence in a chapter of
the women's liberation movement and you established it as
a fact. What would you do?

Assuming that we can't get into this harassing and so
on, you agree that that no longer has any validity. So what?
What do you have? :

Mr.,Adams. We have potential violations which might
arise, which rarely come to fruition and haven't for many
years, but we do havé an intelligence responsibility under

a a :
the directives from the President and the Attorney General. -

has taken over control of a domestic group and the Communist
Party is operated by the Soviet Union. We would furnish that
information as we do. Every copy of our reports goes to the
Department of Justice. : Hine : : : Baa

Sanator Mondale. -Right. But I just want to get the
King case because as I understood, he was being investigated
for the reason that it was feared that a Communist or
Communists who wera suspected of being Communists, or
known to be Communists, were gaining. influence over him.

Suppose you established that. What present use or
need is there for that information?

Mr. Adams. I feel that the President, the Attorney
General, the Executive Branch, needs ue know the extent of
a foreign-directed Communist organization, its influence and
effect on the United States of America.

Senator Mondale, All right. So if such information
is valid and an investigation to seek it are necessary, is
there any limit on the investigative authority of the FBI2

We have just heard about the women's liberation movement
where we were faarful that) New Left, SDS types might have
an influence. That justified that investigation. We now
have your statement that we were fearful that some Communists
might have influence over Dr. King, and Pees he was

Mr. Adams, Well, the only limits are that wé must

guidelines we have or the critéria we have, which criteria
are receiving scrutiny at the present time by Congress. :.They
hava in the past by the- Department of Justice, and this is the
area of guidelines. This whole area of domestic security is
what we need guidelines in.

Senator Mondale. Right. And you would agree, we talked
about this earlier, that being a Communist is not a crime.

Mr. Adams. No, it has not been a crime.

Senator Mondale. So that the whole basis for this has

oranges, with mild laxative type drug by hypodermic needle
or other appropriate method and ship fruit as a donation from
a fictitious person in Miami. to the Jersey City headquarters.

The answer then from the Director of the FBI:

"The Bureau cannot authorize the treating of fruit to
be shipped to Jersey City because of lack of control over the
treated fruit in. transit. However, Newarks's proposed
telegram regarding food collected for the Revolutionary
People's Constitutional Convention has merit."

How did you ever get to a point like that?

Mr. Adams. I don't know. What was the response from
Newark and then the final answer taken?

Senator Mondale, It was turned down because they
couldn't control transit, but they thought it was a good idea.

Do you think that's a good idea?

Now Senator Huddleston earlier asked about efforts to
influence newspapers and media outlet.

Does this trouble you, a decision not to answer questions
from cartain selected media outlets?

Mr. Adams. It is not the policy today. I think this
has been’ aired in the past. There was a period of time .
wherein Mr. Hoover, in reacting to criticism from Me of these]
newspaper men, where he felt he hadn't been given a fair
shake, or for some other reason, that he felt that they should
be told no comment, and he instructed they be told no comment.

The motivations I am not in a position to discuss, but

I can tell you that there has been no such policy in the
last several years that I know of. .
Senator Mondale. IE you could submit for us, if you
can find it, the no-contact list, I would appreciate that.
I have some other questions I wilt submit for the
record, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Very well. I just have one final ‘follow-up
quastion on Senator Mondalé's interrogation.

I continue to be somewhat fascinated by how long these

investigations go, and when, if ever, they are stopped.

kept up in our life from time to time. I remember during

the days of McCarthyism in this country, we came very close

to the point where people had to prove that they were: not
now or had never been a Communist in order to establish them-
selves as patriotic citizens.
