conversation he and the Director had with Nosenko regarding his establishing
himself in a new area, he would expect that such a session would be very
disruptive to him. SA/DDCI Smith suggested that the Committee may be
interested in surfacing the "Monster Plot." Mr. Carlucci responded that if
this were the case, this effort should be headed off and he would be
willing to discuss the same with Congressman Stokes.

McMahon noted that former DDO employee Goodpasture testified before
the House Select Committee on Assassinations on 12 April and she felt
browbeaten by the Committee. McMahon also expressed concern that the
Committee had duplicated classified documents. White said that Committee

Lapham said that Deputy Assistant Attorney General Keuch was informed
by House Assassinations Committee Counsel Blakey that the Committee wanted to
enroll three people in the Federal Witness Protective Program administered
by the Department of Justice. SA/DDCI Smith said the three individuals
probably were Nosenko, Golitzyn, and Deriabin. Lapham said this procedure
would be inconsistent with our handling of defectors. Mr. Carlucci said that
a strategy has been developed regarding how to handle this problem with the
Committee, which would include the stipulation that the Committee would
interview these individuals here at the Agency. Smith noted that when
Deriabin appeared yesterday, he refused to testify unless he could be assured
that he could go through the resettlement process all over again. Miller
said this probably precipitated Blakey's idea about suggesting enrolling
these individuals in the Department of Justice progran.

Mr. Blake outlined his understanding of the House Assassinations Commit-
tee's plans to interview Nosenko at the Agency on 31 May and to have the
session video-taped and audio-taped, in addition to having the usual steno-
type transcript taken. A lengthy discussion ensued on concerns about the
taping aspects of the session. Miller said the Committee hoped to use the
tapes for public viewing. SA/DDCI Smith highlighted his meeting yesterday
with Committee Counsel Blakey, who noted that the Committee reserves the
right to determine how it is going to use the information it obtains from
interviews with the three defectors (Nosenko, Golitzyn and Deriabin). Smith
said the Committee now seems to be working toward highlighting the issue of
the Nosenko/Golitzyn conflict on Oswald and this could lead to very serious
problems. Strathern noted that these procedures would discourage any future
defectors. Blake said he would meet with Smith on this topic following the
meeting. Smith noted serious problems with the Committee's view that any
information these three individuals provided before they actually defected
is public property.

Mr. Blake asked Hetu to explain the disturbing ABC story emanating

from Havana. Hetu said that ABC reporter Reynolds called him and said

that as part of Cuba's 26 July celebration, a double agent will march in

a parade and appear at a press conference, saying that CIA tried to prove

that Cubans were involved in President Kennedy's assassination. Castro

also plans to announce CIA activities in Africa to track the Cuban presence

there. Hetu told Reynolds that he hesitated to comment at the present time

but the charge regarding the Kennedy assassination was ridiculous.

McMahon summarized an FBI report that a Cuban Intelligence Service
official has been in contact with an unidentified journalist in connection
with the World Youth Festival now taking place in Cuba. ‘The journalist
stated that the festival will include a tribunal that will condemn CIA
activities throughout the world. It will also reveal the above-mentioned
charge that the CIA tried to prove Cuban involvement in President Kennedy's
assassination. Former CIA agents will be revealed as well as proof of CIA
activities in Africa. This report also mentioned that a press conference
will be held.

Greaney (for OCC) added that on 21 July an OCC representative paid
off a former agent in New York who had been in prison in Cuba. She had
been a member of the original 26th of July Movement and seemed to have
become extremely radical and bitter. Greaney said that he would not be
surprised if this individual appeared at any of the above-mentioned
activities.

McMahon advised of a problem with the House Assassinations Committee,
which has requested to review personnel files of employees. According to
Scott Breckinridge, this procedure had been agreed to with earlier commit-
tees. McMahon said that employees are objecting, however, and he thought
they were justified in doing so. Lapham said that the Privacy Act was not
relevant in this matter. Blake suggested that this seemed an unwarranted
invasion of individual privacy and an incursion by the Legislative Branch
into the Executive Branch. Blake explained what would be found in a
typical personnel file, and Waller added that many fitness reports contain
operational details. Mr. Carlucci noted that the Department of State does
not allow Congressional investigators to review personnel files. Lapham
said that the Agency would not be on strong legal footing if it denied the
Committee access to the Files. After further discussion, Lapham said that
the Committee could subpoena the information but doing so would be extremely
time consuming. ‘The Director concluded by suggesting that DDO negotiate
with the Committee and ask it specifically what information it required.

that the Agency can try to negotiate with the Committee regarding this

not think the House as a whole would support a Committee request to issue a
contempt citation against the Agency. The Director asked OLC to organize a
meeting to decide how to handle this situation and to consider whether or
not he should speak to Chairman Stokes. He suggested the Agency might be
willing to partially satisfy the two items in the subpoena, but providing
all of the materials seems unreasonable. The Director noted that he would

Hitz advised that the oversight committees have not said anything
about the 15 September hearing before the House Assassinations Committee on
Nosenko. In regponse to the Ditector's question, McMahon said that he was
glad that this last problem area. had been surfaced.

Hitz noted ‘that some members of Congress have also been disturbed
about the House Assassinations Committee's procedures. Lapham advised that
John Hart came to him on 14 September to ask about the advisability of
changing bis status from an independent contractor to an Agency employee to
ensure his immunity from possible libel suits resulting from his testimony
before the Assassinations Committee on 15 September. Lapham dissuaded him
from doing so.

Referring to another newspaper article, the Director asked about
former CI Chief Angleton's allegation that the Agency knew about the bugs
in our Embassy in Moscow before Nosenko revealed the same. Shackley
advised that this question has been researched several times and no record
exists to substantiate this allegation. Mr. Carlucci noted that in his
testimony on 15 September, Hart said that general indications of the taps

existed but no specific information.

Picking up on the Director's suggestion to surface employee concerns,
Taylor noted his understanding that employees at large do not understand

employees regarding the Epstein book, stories about a rivalry between
Angleton and former DCI Colby, and the pro- and anti-Nosenko forces. He
opined that putting the above in perspective might also be helpful. Mr.
Carlucci said that John Hart, who represented the Agency in testifyng
before the House Assassinations Committee on 15 September, tried to put the
Nosenko case in perspective and his transcript is available for anyone who
is interested. HIs report on this matter is also available. Dirks and
Bowie noted that they were not familiar with the background of this case.
The Director then proceeded to highlight it, and EA/DCI Ratlif£ suggested
that a similar review might be helpful for employees. ‘The Director suggested

The Director expressed concern about former C/CI Angleton's lawyers’
contention that after agreeing to grant Angleton access to Agency files
on 5 October, he was later denied access to the files in December and
advised to submit an FOIA request. Lapham said that he would check into
this matter. Mr. Carlucci then explained that Angleton had asked for
access to the files two days before he was to appear in executive session
before Congress and he was therefore granted access to prepare for his
testimony. He did not come to review the files prior to his Congressional
appearance, howevér, and then later asked for substantially more informa-
tion later in December. At that point he was referred to the FOTIA channel.

Lapham outlined his meeting yesterday with former C/CI Angleton regard-
ing the latter's lawsuit. Angleton is seekihg access to classified documents
to rebut former employee Hart's testimony before the House Assassinations
Committee. Lapham suggested that the Agency may want to consider granting
Angleton access to these documents apart from his lawsuit. Doing so would
require at least obtaining an updated clearance for Angleton. In response
to the Director's question if Angleton had been seriously maligned by the
Hart testimony, Lapham said that it was difficult to say, but Angleton
certainly thinks so. In response to McMahon's comment, Lapham agreed that
the Agency could make these documents available to the Committee, but the
Committee is running out of time, and Angleton would not want to comment on
them without seeing them personally. In response to Lapham's question,
attendees noted that former employees were permitted to review classified
papers prior to testifying before the Church Committee. (AIUQ)
