“CONFIDENT TAL

MUCHPRICH, Alfonso Rudolph 4 December 1947

* On Decenber 3, 1947 the investigative files!
of Confidential Govermient .genoy (le2) were examined and
disclosed the following:

Included in the file 4s an Anvestinative
report dated June 25, 1543 regarding one.Septain Al, Re |
Wehtrich, ‘my Serial Nurver 0377220, which revealed 4
no adverse infomation rezurding Subject. it was sone i
tioned, hovever, by four nfornanta that Subjectts i
wos auspeczcd of hay prosJeman leeningo during
War #1, but these suspicions ware not verified bz
informants. Persons interviewed vouched for Subjecsts i
father's loyelty at the tine of the investigation. i

It was noted thot Subjset'!s Personal Wotory
Statonent daved Pebruary 16, 1943 indicates that he was

tigation verified the fact, eaavee, that Subject was born

in Chihuahua, Hexico on October 30, 1915.

In_a casual conversation with another of= :
ficer, Subject volintedred the following information with
Fospect to records of iis virthplace.
he had no birth certificate and had moved fram C
Mexico to El Paso, Texas, with his parents, when he
one or oe year os ed a S bene stated that he hed never”
that he Wes born in Cidiuahua,
until he wes in nish sehooly having proviously prestmed thet
he was bom the locale in which .is childhood was spent,
Viz; Willcox, Arizona.

pjoct stated that?

Subject stated further that he gave his i
birthplace as Yillgox, Arizona on his applicathen foz en= |
listnont in ROTS to eliminate conflint with any previous
records which would then require a..-t of “red tape” in
making what ke considered then a minor discrepancy of no i >
consequence, inasmuch as his father's naturalization autoe
matically nade him (Subject) a citizen of the United States.

it was tho opinion of the officer makin: thé
above report on Subjuct's birthplace, that any confiictin:
records of Subjoot's bizthplace was not due to any motives
of subterfuye, but was ost probably due to Subject's desire
‘to expedite his entrance into college without oncountering i
