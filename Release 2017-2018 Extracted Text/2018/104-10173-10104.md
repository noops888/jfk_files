Subject's statements to the effect that LOGINOY deapos lied

the money back when Subject refused it; ls not in keoping with

the last week in September. (As far as I can tell this la

ISAYEVg first visit to Subjectis-store.) ISAYEV made a:

great many anti-U.s, remarks during his visle to the store

and blamed the U.s. for most of the world's troubles. At one

point he said that the Soviets made much better cars than

the U.s. and that Sovlet cars were bullt llke "tanks".

subject laughed at this remark because the thought crossed

hls mind that only a soldier would like to drive a "tank"

and from where Subject was standing at the time he could.

and he sald that he thought that it might help. I toldi

him tó make plans sor a flesta in honor of Mexican

as possible. He said that he would probably give

the

party on Fridsy, 17 September,. I suggosted that he Invite

Turky ANDRIANOV (the GRU chauffeur) first and tell ANDRIANOV

to Invite soveral of his friends.

At the hext meeting with

Subjeat he reported that NIKIFOROV,

LOGTNOV and KORNUSHRIN

were the only Sovlets who came to

the fleste on the 17th.

They arrived, had a fow drinks, danced t

o some Russian

recorda which they had brought with them and then left.

(Ail are KGB types); They told subject that the other

Sovlets could not attend because they had to attend a Crech

Embassy reception that same evening. L I can find no record

of such a reception either at the Czech on Polish Embaaales

and there is no indication on the Soviet lines that they

had anything planned for that evening. A soviet from

Cuba arrived

on the 17th but we have no idea how many sovlots

were at the airport to greet him. I questioned Subjeet

about the Soviets who. had appeared at the fiesta and he

gave me a littlo information about them. They, visited his

atore several times in the next few weeks and I showed him

photographs of the men and expanded on his previous information.

He had the following to say about them lhe has previoualy

Subject likes KORMUSHKIN who 1s friendly,

well mannered and outgoing. He speaks good Spanish and

told Subject that his wife likes Nexico.: Although KORMUSHKIN

was wearing glassea in the photo show to Subjeot, he

commented that be ofton sees KORNUSHRIN without hia glasses.

He smokes "Record" elgarettes and Subject oalls him

"El Jovencito".

5. Subject said that ISAYEV had dropped by his

store

during the week of 18 October and spent some time making

fun of the King and Queen who were visiting Mexieo at the

tines ISAYEV selt that the very existance or a king and

Queen in 1965 was silly. He also claired that the Soviets

had discovered

the Comet that was then in the sly. (The Comet

their names. He bragged

about the great advances in the

Soviet Union in all flelds and told Subject with great pride

paid that they were "for Viktor KALININ In Moscow" but

subjeet thinks they are "for Yurly ANDRIANOV In Mexico"

subject sald he hasn't the slightest Idea where to buy

such a thing.

8. I told Subject to test the recorder by speaking into

the microphones both in the upstairs room as well as in the

main part of

the store and then to play book the tape.

Although RESCIGNO has explained the workings of the recorder

to subjeot several times, he claimed that he did not know

how to do this. I then Instructed him to disconnect the

recorder and to deliver it to me at 2100 hours on Friday,

5 November. I sald that I would test the recorder myself.

No asked why RESCIGNO could not come to the store and test

It and I told him that RESCIENQ was away. Me then asked if

2. The boy who watches Subject's store at night did not

At 0300 hours on Tuesday (8 February) he:

awakened by the noise of a

car horn and looked fron the

window to see Valentin'S. LOGINOV and Vladislav S. KORMUSHKIN

-blowin the horn of their car in the driveway of the Embassy.

Both Sovlet's were drunk and were yelling for the gato guard

(bino naprened to be SILlIKOV)

over the rate for them.

They were driving car 337-D (LEONOV?s)

or. 336-D (KORNUSHKIN'S).

Subject returned to his

bed and-did not see them leave the

Embassy.

3.

Since both LOGINOV and KORMUSSKIN live in apartments

outside.

the Embassy and since they sould not willingly go

to the Embassy at 3 a.m. while drunk, It is likely that they

were working when they got drunk and therefore had no fear

of being reprimanded-for ite

Both men redlaced known KGB officers

When the flagship of the Sovlet whallng

"fleet arrived recently, there was no ong aboard who spoke:

Spanish or English, and the Captain seemed/to be. completely

lacking in Instructions: about documents. In order to enter the

harbor.

He did not have the necessary papors prepared. A

Soviet Eibassy official was sent from Mexico City in order to

straighten matters out.

ZARATE sald that the

purpose of the visit of 'the

whaling ships was

to take on fresh water nnd supples.

The

crows wero also given likerty.

Also, enclosed herewith for reference are copies of

the

crew list of the Soviet vessel "'Iskatel" which visited

Mazatlan on January 9, 1966.

In connection with the visit of the "Iskatel," it

is noted that a Soviet Embassy

believed to contain Soviet

Commercial Consul GEORGIY STEPHLYQVICH VISKO and. USSR 'Embassy

chauffeur VASILIY STEPHANOVICH NIKOSHNIKOV, was

observed 'on

the highway leading

to Unzatani on January Il,

1966,

and was

subsequently observed on January

1966, in

Mazatlan.

This office is attempting to obtain the crew list

of the Soviet whaling vessels

ISAYEV asked what his fishing plans wore.

Nick said

that he was so busy with his many probloms at the now plant that

he would not be going fishing during June.

Nick then suggested

that they so on the weekend of 1 July.:

ISAYEV answered "Not even Anatolly (XARABACH?"

okay and he could come. This

date is tentative and will be confirmed.

ISAYEV remarked that his wife and child were in

Cuernavaca and that KARABACH's wife would go down on the weekend

of 18 June leaving them both bachelors.

Nick asked ISAYEV about the Soviet volleyball team.

until 1ram.

Nick brought up the point that ISAYEV had never invited

him to

his house.

ISAYEV, definitely uncomfortable and searching

for words,

said

that he hadn'e invited them because his wife

thought: that there was too big a Contrast between Nick's home

and theirs." That Nick was "rich" with lots of beautiful things

that thoy lived very modostly having inherited undistinguished

curniture from has predecessor, etc. Nick pooh-poohed this

stating that friendship is what counts and the circumstances

of one's home meant nothing. ISAYEV ended by saying rather

famely. that he would invite Nick to his home.

Nick said that

from ISAYEV's words and discomfiture, it was

obvious that he:

is ashamed to invite anyone to his house.

Fanally, Nick said that it was his impression that

ISAYEV had absolutely no immediate plans to return to the USSR

and Nick feels that he will be here until November or

December.

YATSKOV did not introduce

Although all the Soviets were ploasant and correct

there was absolutely no socializing or extended conversation.

They did not accept Nick's invitations to come in for a

drink, except for the above noted occasions when they accepted

a drink and lofe taking le wich them.

"Viktor:"

Nick described him. as an older man,

roundish,

boyish

appearance.

However, their conversation was so limited that Nick

couldn't determine his fluoncy.

He obviously understood

•everything that Nick said but his angwors and comments were

short and simple.

As noted above, YATSKOV said that he is

the newly arrived Soviet..

He did not do any fishing himself

but simply watched YATSKOV and the othor Soviet.

thetr early twenties. He has also brought & Soviet woman ca

whom Subject doesn't know. Subject hasn't seen GORLITSYN since

Bince LOGINOY doesn't play tennds but only alta around

outside or in the bar, subject doesn't see hin for sustained:

periods Subject has seen LOGINOV talking to BARMIENTO or his

wite two or three times. From observing bim in the bar,

• Subjeet

saw that LOCINOV 1s on speaking teres with several members.

I asked Subject 1p he knew Ofella ALPARO Lopez (P-11339),

a good friend of the SArMIENTOs and also in contact with the

Soviets.

To didnt recontrother name an a club member rathen

I told him that she teaches at the School of Economics,

remembered that at a dinner party at the home of Henry

woman was present who was a professor of Economics. She: speaks

He thinks this-la

He will check his wife who is the name

renenberer In the family.

Subject remarked that he found the above dinner strange

for its odd mixture of solid busdaess, types and a few off-beat

Por the next meeting Subject will attempt to confir

ALFARO's identity and also to spot likely club membere who

appear to be in close terms with the SARMIENTOs with the view

of setting an assesament of the latter.

subject is interested and willing.

However, he does

not appear to be very much interested in people.

Thus he baa

played tennis with SARMIENTO for years and hasn't a thing to

say about hin except that. he 19 a pleasant tennis companion.

Similarly SARMIENTO's. wife is good

looking and & good tennis player.

8. I haven't had an opportunity to talk to Subject's wife

yet because Subject says that she does not know the SARMIENTOS.

I met his wife last fall and noted that she is much more alert,

interested

and lively in social relations than he 1s.

Therefore

I bet that she knows a lot more than he gives her credit for.

I Intend to invite them to dinner soon in order to talk with the

wife and explore possibilities.

If. Suby would be available that day.. Juby responded that he was clad that the c/o

hod called because he had to nog him ursontly. In pharaoteriotió manner Subj trying

doublotalk told the c/o that he had recelved a telegram. that his old friend (irikbors)

was

back, and that he wes coins to see the "two of them" (Prikhodko and logirior) at

2500 that day at the for de Moxloo. The C/Q was mizzled by the reference to the

colesal, and askod incredulously if the

telegram had anythine to do with sottins

up the meeting with his friende.

Subfle anever was ambiguous, and the C/O lot it

8o at that because he arranged a

kriof neet with Subj for 1230 at Seers Restaurant:

hod to alic for the fact that there mlent havo been apecial circuntancos in

the sovlote! arranpetent for their meet with subf. further, thia was Brikhodko!s

firet ucet with Subj after return fron Moscow, where it is presumed he had taken

up Sub'a crue with hs superioro and the line decided on how to deal in the ruture

with their ringing, non-cooperative "acent."

A reasonable ocntisoney expectation

was that the Sovlets nicht have a "hot" proposition to moke to Suble and the c/o

decided to brief. Subj to the ritent that if the Soviets broached a really important

operational assimmont, which Subf was. to judgy, Subj would onduct himalf so as

to draw out the Soviets but stall on acceptance. If nothing of overriding importan

At 1230 the C/o say Subj for Juet a few minutes, during whioh the tolostan

was explaineds it mas from Moscon, Inviting Subj'o travel agenoy to pirticipite

had leamed from Prikhodko then the latter had called earlier in the noming to

make the appointment for the meet that aftermoon that Brikhoako was avare of the

Invitation and would talk to subj about if at their meet. the c/o imparted to

subs the briefing outlined above, stressing that Subj must Judge whother the

Sovlota were proposing something that was so important that he couldn't dierios

It out of hand - In rhioh case he ves to be non-comittal and stall on a decicion

3o. The Co had communicated to the Station the tack he was going to take, and.

"as later inforned by the Station" to reverse the planning of Subj'e attitude toward

/Commente Subs explatned to the C/o that ho sensod tho trap immediately, recosniains

that this was the old bent of the Soviets on which he had furiahed a wealth of

Information in the past. Suby reasoned that if the Soviete were fishing with the

old bait, he would not flae to 1t ensorly because in view of his recent noos

cooperative behavior it would only confirn to the Soviets that he was bejas

controlled (by the MIS) Me would not reject the inainuation of hio cooperation

out of hand and categorically, because that rould not be conglotent with bis pasture

ôf ronatning on crendly toruo vith the Sovieta. Merofore he took the middle road,

that of being non-comittal or unoonitted, where the initiative of connliancé was

always in hia hands

Parinthetically, Suby told the c/o that if the policy is

that of complete rajortion of the Sovieta he should not have even set them; but

following the policy of "hanta la morte- amos, pero hacer nada" he felt de vas

doing the richt thing In stringing them along a barren path. Thus, without batting

in eye he simply repeated what he had already told thom./ Subf satd he would have

to confult Goboracin bocause he didn't know lf his company had the muuired

capitalization to placo à foreimer in a Job - but thie being l'exico, arrains could

probably bo dong. /Commonts Subj remarked to the C/O at this point that she Soviete

could not seriougly connider uning Subj'o Cira to "lecalito" their son, because.

It rould be a patont fraud to the omployeen in hia lew, and he dia not think the

Soviets vere stupid about such thing.

The C/o's surmary comment to Subj'e unspoken plea for critiotsn or his ccurse

of action was that under the concopt of a "friends, yest work, no" policy terard:

the soviets he was doine e fine fob of walking the tightrope.

The C/o asked Subj If there had boon any travel arrangements for nor sortets

to

the Soviet Union.

Suny replied that Jullo Rothengtreich, whom Subj cheracterized

as a Germen Jen, and his nife, a Russian Jew, had Jeft 5 Sept to New York en risto

LICOZX-5 reported on 20 September that LICANNYI

• the 24-29. Intourist Conference In Moscow. This was

confirmed by LlENVoY on the same dato.

Since the Station

had had no contest with Subject sine 6 danuary ighh, I:

contacted Don Lautz of the Visa Seotion on 27 Septerber.

to see 1f Subject was still coming into the Embassy

regularly the on visa business.

Lautz

said that Subject

had for some time now been sending an agent to the

Embassy rather than coming himself. Lautz readily

agreed to give Subjeot a call, however, and reached.him

late that afternoon. He told Subject that the "people"

at the Embassy woom he had introduced Subjest to earlier

were Interested in talking with him and asked if he could

drop Into the Embassy in the next row daye.

Subjeot

Immediatoly recognized which "people" Lautz was referring

to, sald that as a matter of fact he had something to

discuss with

"them," commented that it probably in fact.

involved the same matter, and agreed to come to Laut's

office at 11:00 the next daye

As he had done with Irving

A. Oronslit, Lautz agreed to let me use his orfico to

talk to Subject.

2. I went to Lautz's offico at 11:00 or the 28th,

but when Subject had not appeared by 11:15, Lautz agreed

to call me in my office when Subject arrived. Lautz called

about 11:30, and I went right down. By the time I got

there, however, Subject had already explained to Lautz

that ho was sure I wanted to talk about his invitation to:

the USSR and had given Lautz a list of three other

Inutes to to Intrarlat conference. Lautz introduced

me by true name as Oronsky's replacement. Sutject, in

what-Lautz had forewarned me was his usuall over enthusiastio

marner, greeted no with a "bollevo mo, it is my ploasure"

salutation and, upon

confirming that it was the Intourist

conference I was interest in, took off from there:

Without

the slightest prompting, he rattled off the following:

a) He had recelved a telegram from

Moncow on

6 september inviting him to an Intourlat conference in

Moscow from. 24-29 Detober.

He had immediately thought

of Informing

the Embassy, but because of the pressure

of business siriply hadn't gotten around to 1t. When

Lautz called him, he knew Immediately what we were

intorested 1n.

b). He had prepared a Xerox copy of the telegrain.

for us; which ho gavo to mo.

He has not yet definitely

made up his mind about

attending the conference, but

thinks he probably will go. At the moment, he was still

awalting the detailed lotter on the conference which,

according to the telogram, was to folion. (LICOZY-S has

atready rocolved his lettor.) In reply to my question

as to whether he was sending enough people to the USSR

to make the trip really worthwhtle, he said that he

had sont only five people there so far this year, but

that he thought travel to the Soviet Union

was definitely

going to pick up. He said that LOGINOV, who has beer

thọ Sovlot official he has been dealing with about visas,

to Moscow could consequently bo made at rolatively little

additional expense.

c) Subject continued that 1f he did go to roscow,

ho would be glad to submit a report on his trip when he

got back, got (group) pictures, 1f we wanted them, of

his eyes open. However, he said, as he told Oronsky, ho

la not intorested in working for us on a pormanent basio,

was w9l1.a1g to help, he erplulned, because he belleved

basically what we did about current world problems and,

aftor all, had ilved in the Statas for many yearg and

rogarded 1t as his

"second home." He said he llked the

arrangement of meeting in Lautz!s office because 1t made

clandestine meetings unnecessary and because he had &

perfectly legitimate reason for being there.

d) Subject

stated that he had already given Lautz

the names of the other travel agents in Mexico whom he

had heard had been invited

to Moscow and said that once

he received the Intourlot letter givang the detalls on

the conference he would begin calling around to see

exactly who was going.

3. Since a) Subject had already volunteered to do

primarily what I Intended to ask him; b) had not yet

definitely dedided to make the trip, e) Lautz gave no

Indication of preparing to leave us alone, and a) I

clearly could not got any farther with Subject on a

personal level with Lautz present, I brought the meeting

to an end with a request to see Subject again after he

had recelved the Intourist letter, obtained the names of

nose of big colleasues mao were zoing and decided

definitely whether or not be was going to go. Subject

4. Subjoct impresses me as a very sharp, shrewd,

cool-headod, but probably basically sincere indivlaual.

No had the situstion rigured perfectly when he arrived

In Lautz's office, had decided precisely what ho would

be willing to do, knew exactly what he was going to say,

and wasted no words in saying 1t.. I plan to try to got

to know him a little better next time, Elve him a defensive

briefing as well as one on what to keep his eyes open

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1. This. is d new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment

Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ Ill) which has been in

use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires

far less essay type reporting than the previous form.

2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de

veloping d system -for "indirect.assessment of larget personalities.. The

system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews observations

of appearance, manner, and stile of behavior. Such observations are:

used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are

weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile..

Working from the

profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic

aptitudes, artitudes, motives and susceptibillies:

The goal of the assess.

ment is to identity feasible means of influencing the target person,

J. Reliability is vastly Increased when two or more observers complete

this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact,

it isa rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully

You are

encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking.

Mark such

items with a "C." inslead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, an

observer with very limited contact can be expected to enter more "G's"

than MX's."

(Check the most appropriate description.)

He is o hearty, hale fellow who laughs with gusto and pleasure

His humor is forthright, not subtle, and although he is sometimes

loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the

time, his good humor. is contagious.

He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with con

siderable gusto. However, he is fréquently dour and sometimes.

intolerant and somewhot humorless. His humor is direct, even

crude, end at times, inappropriate. He tends to be the kind of

person who laughs more at people than with people.

He is à good-humored fellow who sometimes can be considered

jolly and carefree. His humor is clever and well timed. He. is

quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often

can do d good job appropriately livening up a party. Although

something.of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.

He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person

who, or times, can be surprisingly goy and carefree: However,

when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and causes some strain for

those ground him. His humor is öften cleyer but he con be

quite sarcostie and even biting on occosion.

He is on urbane fellow, generally quite corventional and appro

priate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless persion,

but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi

cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way.

he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied:

than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate:

He is a dour and humorless person always serious and intense.

It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re

sponsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.

He is ó sensitive, sophisticated fellow with a subtle wit. He

can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.

However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his

sense of humor and he. con be quite condescending towards

people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor -i

He is go arty somewhat cypical person who con be quite

flippant of times: His humor tends lo be a bit farout: He

seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates. It is

sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing.or

subtly hostile:

None of these fit. I would describe him oss.
