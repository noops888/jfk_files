(fais is the car regularly driven by LOCINOY.) A LICALLA paoto-

graph of Subject is forwarded as Attachment 5 (leadquarters only).

: 4, From LIESVOY it appears that LOGINOV was principally
responsible for Sudject's travel arrangenents. LOGINCV. probably
met Subject at the airport, sitce LIMITED reported that LOGINOV
left tae Soviet’ Lwbassy in 19-DA at 0535 and returned at 0058 on

20 March: 1960, apparently having dropped Subject off at’ the’ liotel
Agnes. Subject's wife was not reported to hive visited the Lmbassy.

S.. The Station had not believed that, Subject would be able
to take the 21 Marchi ‘flight to Havana, since, there ad@been no.”
fecord of his having requested a Cuban visa; however, ‘a LION
photograph subsequently received, showed tliat-Soviet Vice

_ that -he'was so busy with his many probloms at the new plant that
he would not be going. fishing during June. Nick then suggested
a ee that ‘they go on.the weekend of 1 July. However, He added: "but
Bee Auge .you and.me. - Don't ‘bring: any of your friends like that rude

Nick answered that Anatoliy okay and-he could come. - This ~
date is tentative and will be confirmed. 7 aesdeeiecet

uri 9e- Nick brought up the polat that ISAYEV had never invited:
him to his house. ISAYEV,. definitely uncomfortable and searching
for words, said that he hadn't invited them because his wife :
thought: that ‘there was too big a contrast between Nick's hone
and theirs. That Nick was "rich" with lots of beautiful things -
that they lived very modestly having inherited undistinguished
furniture from his predecessor; etc. “Nick pooh=poohed this.
stating that friendship is what counts and the circumstances
of one's home meant nothing. — ISAYEV ended by saying rather
famely. that he would invite Nick to his home. Nick said that
. from ISAYEV's. words and discomfiture, it was obvious that he.

ashamed: to invite. anyone to his house. ; ~~

: 10. : Fanaliy, Nick said that it was his impression. that
ISAYEV had absolutely no immediate plans to return to the USSR

CONTACT. REPORT

1, Tmet Nick at his partment from 2030 to 2200 in —

order to debrief him on the fishing weekend of 3-5 June.

“Nick reported that When “he and his Mexican friend

aes at Pucuato at 1845 on- Friday, 3 June, YATSKOV and -- .

two ‘other Soviets were already there fishing in front of the
cabins. They had come in ISAYEV's VW. Shortly thereafter
the Soviets came to the cabins. and Nick greoted YATSKOV and

introduced his Mexican friend to him. YATSKOV did not introduce >

the other two.Soviets by name but they. all did shake hands,
Nick invited them all into his room but only YATSKOV came,
He. accepted a drink snd.left with it. Later outside Nick
asked: one of. the: new Soviets ‘his name ‘and. got the. answor,
"Vasilio."” The-other one then used an English. word and Nick

‘-asked. if ‘he spoke English. This. Soviet said his naine was

Viktor and that he’ spoké a. little English. Nick then asked
YATSKOV which of tho other. two was the newly arrived Soviet.
YATSKOV'said that it was Viktor. Nick then lent them his.
extra lentern and that ended things for the night.

- 3, The next day both: groups fished. soparately at
Sabanita, About noon-YATSKOV came by and noticed that Nick
was-chaving luck so he brought: the other ‘two Sovs to a spot
mmediataly Pajacent They stayed about an’ hour, didn't
They met, again. that ‘evening at ‘the

upset: Jealous and even angry. Nick then .
invited Viktor ‘in for a di nk, . -Viktor’did the same as YATSKOV,.
took. the drink with him. -YATSKOV' said that the Soviets would
leave Sunday morning: since théy had no luck, Nick left ~
early Sunday morning for fishing. He ‘later learned from the’
owner that, the Soviets had left fairly early Sunday morning. ~.

4. Although all the Soviets were ploasant and-correct
there was absolutely no socializing or extended conversation. i
They did not accept Nick's invitations to come. in for a i
drink, except for the above noted occasions when, ed accepted
a drink and left taking it with them, a .

S$. "Viktor: Nick described hin. as. an older fan, 36
to 42, mediuw height, 82-85 hilos, heavy but not fat. build,
_ roundish, boyish face, looked like. an American in general -
appearance. - Does not spéak ‘Spanish, Said he spoke a little i‘
English. However, their conversation was so limited that Nick
couldn't determine his fluency. He obviously understood

“everything that Nick said but his answers and comments were fie

‘short and simple. As noted above, YATSKOV said that he is
‘the newly arrived Soviet. He did not do any fishing himself 1
but simply watctied- YATSKOV and tho othor. Sovict.: : i

6. I showed Nick a.picture of BOYAROV, Nick couldn't
positively identify it. Our picture has sunglasses. During
iday Viktor had on a whité towel protecting his“neck and~

8 ise hat ‘but ao-sunglasses,, At night Nick saw very little
of him and it wag dark. However, Nick did say that our photo siete
was not at all incompatible with Viktor. Also-showed him a’.
photo & GAZIYEV and he said that this was definitely not
Viktor. (COMMENT: Sincé. GAZIYEV and. BOYAROY are the cog

I met his wife last fall and noted that she is much more alert,

2. subject: started things out by saying nat Coarse is_

tryin, to recruit him to report on-LIEMPTY-6, Review of his notes

and d’gcussion revealed the following:. On 5. November LOGINOV

camo in, Subject” told him he had found a house on Juanacatlan.

LOGY said that he's looking for one 6n the Chapultapec Park
af Talz. Tacubay= and’ for, Subject to keep looking. Then ~
V-gaid that he would live to rent an apartment at P.A,

< Santos 104, Subject told him they arc’ all occupied.

Loctkuy said Subject nust know these apartments 11, Subject

mitted that-he did and began to sketch them by[LOGINOV

ted in his efforts, ".LOGINOV then, asked.

admitted that he did, At this point ‘some other Soviets came in ;
and the conversation was terminated. On 6 November LOGINOV
-dropped ‘by’ for'‘solie small ‘talk~and left’ sonie Sovict ‘chocolate |
(which Subject showed me) for Subject's grandchild. 00.9 November

tectuid ‘hin to. report, on L: EMPTY-6 (who lives“in P,A: de 108.

Santos 104), I asked why LOGENOV-would be interested.in LIEMPTY-6,
(there is riothing about aim in the nétés). Subject answered

that he finds LIEuPTY-6 very suspicious because in the 5 years |
that he has known him, Subjeét doesn't. know what hé.does for a
living. “He thinks he writes novels. In any case he is ‘home

all day-long. In addition he lies. Examplé: ‘He told Subject
that-he owns the new (LILYRIC) building. He is also eccentric.
Besides his windows face on the Embassy. LIEMPTY-6 has apartment
17, The apartment directly below his, number 13, (probably old
LILYRIC) is empty. Subject went to sce the owner having LOGINOV
in mind. The owner said that the apartment had been rented by
LIE M@TY-6 which Subject also finds surprising. The whole theme
was that -he is suspicious of LIEMPTY-6 and that-LOGINOV wants
to recruit him to report on hin, All of the above on LIE} TYAS
and his apartment was verbal, There was not a word about

io his notes. . . a

contacted Don Lautz of the Visa Section on 27 Septender.

to see if Subject was otin coming into the Embassy

regularly oie ‘on visa business. Lautz said that Subject

had for sore. time now been sending an agent to the

Embassy: rather than ne himself. Lautz readily”

ag: reed to: give Subjeot, @ call, however, and reached -him

late that afternoon. He told Sub jéet that the "people™

but when Subject had not avpeared by 11:15, Lautz agreed

“to call me in my office when Subject arrived, Lautz called

about 11:30, and I went ‘right down. By the time I got

there, however, Subject had already explained to Lautz

that he was sure I wanted to talc about his invitation to .

manner, greeted me With a Melieve me, it is my ‘ploasure”

salutation andy upon. confirming “that 16 was. the Intourist fae ee

conference I was interest in, ‘took off from ‘there. ‘Without 3
: the slightest: prompting, he rattled off the. following: :
: a) He had received a telegram from Moscow on ~

6 Septémber inviting hig’to an’ Intourist conference in

Moscow from. 24-29 October. He had immediately thought

a of Anforming the Embassy, but becauss of the vressure . .- A
of Business: siuply hadn't gotten around to ite when :
Lavtz called him, he knew immediately what We were

interested ins ie
). ‘He had prepared a Xerox copy of the telegrain

for us; which he gave-to. me, “He has not-yet definitely

made up hd mind ‘about atténding the coriference;- but -

bhinks he. probably will go... At the. moment, he was still

awaiting the detailed ‘Letter on the ‘goriference which, ° ee

according | to the ‘telegran, was to follow. (LICOZY-5. has

already Foceived his. jetter.) In séply to riy question
a3 to whether he was’ sending enough pedple to the USSR ee

i 2 ‘to ‘make the trip really worthwhile, he seid that he

had sent only five people there so fer this year, but
that he thought travel to the Soviet Union was definitely
going to pick up. Ho said that LOGINOV , who has been

tho Soviet official he has been dealing with about visas,



to Moscow could consequentiy bo made at relatively little
\

additional expense,
c) ‘Subject continued that 1f he did go to Moscow,

after all, had lived in the States for many years and
