June 1965 he was reported to be a mombor of the Pronto Electo:
Pueblo (FSP). He was a founder of the Movimiento do Liboracion
Nacional (MLN) of which ho was the head of the hational press and

; - °. Propaganda committee as of 1962, RICO acted. as a Cuban agent in
7 trips to Central and South America in late’ 1963 and early 1964. His
.Pro-Castro communist writings ag Well as his contacts with known
Soviet and Bloc intelligence personnel in Moxico during the past few
years strongly suggest. propaganda role under Journalistic cover on

behalf of their interests,

2, Little is known of RICO's oarly life or oducation beyond
what is listed in his basic biographic data. Thoro ia a possibility
that be was active in communist affairs in Costa Rica and Bl Salvador
in the poriod 1946-1948 and in Colombia in 1949-1950,

3. RICO Galan's prominence in Mexican leftist cixclos han beon
primarily intellectual, In an articlo in Siompre in March 1963 ho
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the truo
Adeology of Lazaro CARDSNAS. RICO felt that this would provide tha
Mexican loft with a political party truly responsive to the radical
tendoncies of the 1910 revolution, This was nocessary, in RICO's
view, because the MUN was an action organization rather than a
political party, whoso momborship covered 2 political spectrum from
the Partido Revolucitonario Insti tucional (PRI) to tho Partido
Conuntata de Noxico (PCH), and was therefore diluted ineffectiveness,
A new party would reprosont a “third position"; sSocialism in internal
afiaira and independonce of any Dloc in international affairs, With
auch & political action. am, wrote RICO, the kLN would covolop
naturally into a broad national movement auch as the FRAP in Chile.

4. Victor RICO Galan is an ardont aupportor of Fidel CABTRO and
"48 reported to be a close friond of his, In order to gather material
for a biography of CASTRO, RICO, later joined by his vife, viaited
Cuda in Cctober 1962 for about two months. He visited Cuba again
during part of Hay and moat of June 1963 when he spent oight days with
CASTRO, five of thom at soa in CASTRO'S boat, ostensibly to discuss
CASTRO'a recont trip to the Boviot Union and his talks witn KHRUSCUXY.
On thig visit the Cuban Governuent gave RICO a mission to travel
through Contral and South Anerica to contact local coanunista and
guerrilla leaders and porauade thea to begin imnediately campaigas of
violunce and terror.in order to take the pressure off the PALN in
Venezuela,” RICO wae also charged to try to bring about greator
unity among the various leftist groups,

SECRET

6. In tho Fall and Wintor of 1963 and lato 1964 undertook thig
mission, Evon though a known leftist he possibly had somo arrangement
with the Moaican’Govornsent ‘which may have gotten him spocial privi-
loges and support from Muxicah embansies in couatriea ‘whore he visited.
In Guatemala RICO interviowed Gencral Enrique PERALTA Azurdia the
Chief of Govornment and thon met Raul ALARCON Monsanto, military
training leador of the Partido Guatomalteco de Trabajo (PGT), who took.
him to moet and interview Marco Antonio YON Sosa an anti regine
guerrilla loader; RICO possibly also met a (fnu) GOMEZ Ayau also a
guorrilla leader. In Nicaragua ho mot with Alvaca RAMIREZ Gonzalos,
Socrotary Gonoral of tho Mobilizacion Ropublicana (MR) and a mombor of
the Contral Comuittee of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN). In
€osta Rica ho mot with onc of the MORA brothers,a guerrilla leader.

In Panama ho mot Hugo VICTOR, prosidont of the Partido del Pueblo (PDP),
and David TURNER, loader of the Vanguard of National Action (VAN), and
attompted to reconcile. them in their dispute for leadership oZ the
revolution in Panama; ho also urged an immediate program of sabotage
and violonco, «RICO wont on to Vonozuola to meet Argelia LAYA; he was
probably in contact with tho MIR while there. He then wont to Brazil
where ho contacted Paulo SCHILLING,coordinator of the Popular Mobi-
lization Front. During thig time he may have gone to Cuba briefly and
returned directly to Brazil. After a fow daya back in Moxico RICO
wont to the Dominican Republic whore he attempted unsuccessfully to
obtain photographs of Dominican guorrillaa killed tha month before,
probably to uso them for propaganda purposes. As 4 result of his
contact with the Agrupacion Politicn Catorce Junio (APCJ) in the
Dominican Ropublic ho was able to serve during the Dominican Republic
crisis of May 1965 ag a relay point for material and instructions

from Cuba to the APCJ and alyo as a reporting channel from Juan B,
MEJIA and APCJ leadora to the Cuvau Intelligence Service and the
APCS's CASTRO Cuban leadership in Cuba. After his raturn to Mexico
City RICO visited Cuba again ostensibly to interview CASTRO on hig
most recent trip to the Soviet Union and probably to report on hig

mission.

6. RI€O Galan continued his intorest in the guerrilla struggle
and was reported to have entered Guatomaia clandestinely in August
1964 and possibly several times before then as well, to viait YON
Sosa and his guerrillas, In’ March 1966, aftor having returned from
Cuba the month before, he planned to travel again to Guatemala
elandestinely in order to investigate the disappearance of Victor
Mantiel GUTIERREZ, leader of tho PGT and of the Guatemalan oxile
community in Mexico, who had recontly returned to Gustemala.

7. RECO’s writings show an ardent support for the guerrillas

me how glad he was to see me. He Inquired about his friend
Carlo Cocclolls | replied simply that | had seen him In Rome
before he left for Paris and he was fine, (At the end of
the meeting, RICO Galan asked me. to convey his greetings to
Ceccloli when | returned to .Ltely, and of gourse fF sald 4

thoughts during the discusslon and In anstier to questions.
A felendly rapport was imiediately established between us,

&. 1 explained at the outset that § was on a tour of
Latin America to study conditions and revolutionary movements,
if he were agreeable, | sald J also wished to write a plece
on him for Corrissondenze Soclallsta. RICO Galan was very
agreebble, {also said that Tf he wished to write an article
for my periodical, we would pay him. He elso found this Idea
agreeable; but qualified his approval by saying he first
wanted to take a look at the periodical to see its “line”
and format,

5. Hy First substantive question was how he viewed the
revolutionary situation-in Latin America. { asked whether
he thought "violent revolution" a necessary stage In the
cevelopment of Latin America. He answered quickly and

emphatically that. "violent revolution throughout Latin
America was "Indispensable" because the peaceful road to
necessary change was "blucked everywhere”. He saw
revolutionary movements on-the rise everywhere In-Latin
America 1 asked for the Ideoldgical nature and affitlations
of these revolutionary movements. He replied that they are —
Marxist, but-with liberal tendencies, not a8 rigid as the

“Fuerza Armada Rebelde (FAR)", led by Cesar Montes, now that

said, had Trotskyite Influences, while the "FAR" was. ‘
"Castrista/indopendent", and with tles to the Guatemalan

RICO Galan asked ma to read a recent article on Venezuela

by Marlo Menendez Rodriguez, Olrector of Su. » who had
recently been to Venezuela and had Interviewed the FLN leaders,
in answer to my question, RICO Galan described Menendez as a
Sperlodista Castrolstca", oe

7. RICO Galan described Mexico as an apparent
democracy but "police state, tightly held". Here the
“$opular movements" are on the rise. in answer to my
question as to who was leading these “popular and
revolutionary movements In Mex!co and Latin America, RICO
Galan replied that thero. were no leaders iIke Castro around,
and the leaders would come from the writers, Intellectuals

and lawyors,

8. tasked RICO Galan for his appraisal and total. ._
Gvaluation of Fidel Castro Ruz. He said, first. of all,. if
Cestro ts @ Communist or what kind of a Communist he Is,
tacticlan, but he can not play the role of liberator of Latin
America for he 1s. too dependent upon Russia ond Russia
controls. him tightly. J think’ RICO: Geton meant to Imply that
Gastro-has:..become-a tool of the lets. He sald, Ernesto.

Soviet. chains, but not. able to do this, As to the

“9 Ragarding-CubsrisSov,tet_ conf: cts, RICO Galan said
they aré more apparent than real nL asked him to’ names

Castro has dominant Influence within the revolutionary move= |
mants In Vonezuala, Guatemala, ai] of Central America, and i
Colombia. The Soviats have dominant Influence In Chile,
Argentina and Mexico. However, he added, In Maxlco, Castro |
and Hoscow see “eye to eye” and have parallel policies, but i

a guard f the office of the prison c ; t
RICO Galton; bis. lewyer was. ther

with @ warm handshake. Ee

12, The foregoing clearly reveals RICO Galan to be an
unrepentant, fervent revolutionary. He belfeves, on the
basis of what he said, that he I assoclated with a winning
cause, Ha was In-high spirits and looked fine.

13. | returned to the Lecumberr! Penitentiary at about
5115 P.M, the same afternoon for another session with RICO
Galan, The main door entrancé was closed. 1 knocked and a
guard opened a little window. 1 asked to see the Olrector,
but the guard sald he was not there. { explained who $ was
and whot | wanted; when he heard the name of HICO Galan, the
guard sald It was Impossible to see him and closed the window.
A moment later I:knocked again. 4 asked the guard if he would

was Impossible, only the Director could do that. The guard

certainly Wid his duty. =

| REFERENCE: NeXico City 9890 (IN 75995), 11 Jan’ 67

1, Reference reported that the Mexico City Station
put LIENVOY/2 in telephone contact. with the undersigned
on 11 January. Following. is’a full account ‘of my. subsequent
contacts with LIENVOY/2 on 12-13: January on, the Rico Galan
case, -:L/2 Served as out-out between the Station and
LITEMPO/S in arranging my interview with’Rico Galan at. the
Lecumberri penitentiary on 13° January,

2, The evening of 11 January:L/2 phoned me at my.
hotel and asked to seé.’mé..the next morning; hé suggested
having breakfast ‘together at my hotel at: 0830, He-came on
time and we’ spent about an hour together. He stated that
his purpose was to find out for LIYEMPO/3 what my. cover
story and detailed plan were for the interview with Rico, .
At the outset he wanted to know whether I was ‘gn American
or Italian citizen, He must also have been curious about
my exact relationship with. the Asency, but did not probe at
all, and of course “I refrained frox volunteering any info.

3. L/2 seemed satisfied with my cover as an Italian
Journalist on a tour of Latin Agerica for. the Rome “perlodical,
CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA. ‘He. approved also-of the idea of
my mentioning Carlo Coccioli to-Rivo as a ‘fellow journalist
whe had asked mé in Italy in Detesber ‘to pay Rico a visit
during’ my forthcoming trip to Mexico, L/2 expressed the
view, however, that it.was»rather unlikely that Rico would
agree to see:me, He ‘said in Mexico prisoners. in general.
and especially Rico, were very suspicious and rarely wanted
to see strangers in prison. He then gave me a briefing on



N

Rico which painted Rico as in extremely evil and clever
character, who did not possess one ounce of sincerity,

and who would fever evase being a Marxist revolutionary,
for stripped. of hia ‘Marxist propaganda weapons Rico was.

4...1 told: L/2: bricfly of my successful expericnce
with a similar. éase in. the Philippines, He commented that
je tas easier to be successful in the Philippines "for the
level of ulture there, perhaps, is not as bigh as: hero,"

5. We parted with the understanding that L/2 would”
phone meat the COS's.office later that morning-aftor hig -
rogting with LITEMPO/8. When he called, at absat 11:00,
L/2 said LITEMPO/8 liked ‘the cover story and the plan. but
he wanted to increase tho chances that Rico would scene

Gisned statement of his willingness to tell all in return _

for his {rcedom) ‘to Rico carrying my calling card and an

issue, of my periodi¢al; she would: then persuade. Rico to
see mo, zs -

6. During a later phone conversation with L/2:1
pointed out the. risk*involved:in bringing Elena Garro into
the’ operation. (The Station"& position was definitely
Against her. involvement), Boing wealthy, influential,
unpredictable and uncontrollable, Elena Garro, I pointed
out, might make a-phoné-call to the Periodical in Roino and
expose our hand, L/2 veported back to LI/8, who agreed
with ow! position. L/8 then cameup with the idea of my
writing a letter. of introduction. for Rico and requesting
an interview, I agreed to thig Scheme, Later that evening
T received instructions from L/2 that at 11:00 the next
rerning I should go’ to the office of the Director of
Lecumberrd penitentiary and request to see Rico. the
previous day L/2' had stated that LITEMPO/8 wanted to go
Over “the "whole’ agenda" with me before 1 went to’sce Rico,
but plans apparantaly changed nud 1 did not have auy contact
with LITEMPO/8,

the letter of introduction, and got it Hace from him after
he bad read it. In’ the niiddle of our interview Rico asked
to have the ‘letter again ‘and T-handed it to hia, My plan
had been not to huve the letter end up in Rieo?s hands if
posslvle, but the abrupt éading. of the meeting prevented my
