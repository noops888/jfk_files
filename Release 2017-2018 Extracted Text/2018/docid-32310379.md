In vlew of the request by Department attorney Charles %.

experienced Special Agents interview Richard I. Kavner immediately.

This interview must be well-planned by the Agents

assigned to conduct same and they must be thoroughly familiar

with all the details of this matter.

Kavner

should be intervieved away from his

place of employment or his

the interview must be conducted in such a manner so as not to

roveal any information in Bireau files and so that Kavner will

not become aware that LA 4381-PC and LA-4350-C have furnished

information to us in this case.

Should Kaver request that an attorney be present during

you are to be guided by instructions as set forth

on page ISC of

AIRIEL TO SAC, St. LOUIS

RE:

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; EARL SCHEIB; ET Al.

Bear in mind that LA-4350 -C has repeatedly advised Los Angeles

that Kavner is disgrntled with the Teamsters Union and

. has

tried to resign. Any such

indication during the interview should

be capitalizod upon to the fullest extent possible, as

Kavner undoubtedly could becone &

very valuable source of

information should he see fit to

do so.

Handle this matter immediatoly on a TOP PRIORITY

basis and suzad or airtel the same day the interyien is conducted

setting forth a succinct summary of the results.

NOTE:

Kavner is an international organizer of the Teamsters

Union

who reportedly works directly under both Hoffa and Harold J.

Gibbons, Executive Vice-President of the Teamsters Union.

LA 1350-C. (Meyer "Mike" Singer, former Teamsters Union official

in Los Angeles,

California, who is furnishing information to

Los Angeles Office on a confidential basis) has repeatedly

advised that Kavner is extremely disgruntled with the Teamsters

Union and has been trying to resign.

Within the last few

weeks Kavner contacted LA 4350-C and requested his aid in

seeking other employment so he could

resign. LA 4350-C

feels Kavner is "ripe for interview."

Kavner, according to LA 4350-C, was instrumental in

effecting the transfer of Earl Scheib's contract with the

United Automobile Workers of America to the Teamsters Union.

Interview with Kavner is a logical investigative

step and the Department has now requested that he be interviewed.

Paral 2/1% 2/25/62 and 2/5/62 and Los Angeles

On 2/6/62 HERBERT MORISSE, JR., Assistant Vice

President, Southwest Bank, St. Louls, Mo., whose identity should

remain confidential,

stated the Teamsters

Union in St. Louis has

numerous accounts at the bank. A number of union employees of

the Feasters Union, Including RICHARD I. KAVNER, have loans here.

MORISSE has regular contact with CHARLES E. ROCKENMEYER,

employed

by the Teamsters, who brings in deposits, signature cards, payments

on loans by officials, etc.

On 2/6/62 ROCKENMEYER stated

• KAVNER

has been out of town but was expected back in the office very soon.

He stated that after a few days KAVNER will leave again on union

business. He indicated KAVNER is still employed by the Teamsters

and gave no intimation of possible resignation.

On 2/6/62 Mrs. RICHARD I. KAVNER was contacted by

phone under pretext of being an old friend of her husband from the

East employed by another union and passing through St. Louis.

Mrs. KAVNER said he had just returned to town but expected to leav

on business "soon." She said he might be contaeted at MO 4-9800

(It will be noted

this is the phone number of Teamsters Joint

Council No. 13 and 1l locals all quartered at 1641 S. Kingshighway

St. Louis, Mo.).

Mrs. KAVNER was specifically asked 1f her hus-

St. Louis files contain no recent information con-

cerning KAVNER's possible resignation.

They do not indi

cate any prior contact with KAVNER by Special Agents of

this office.

SL 1130-6 advised SA HOWARD C. KENNEDY on 2/1/62

and 2/2/62 he has no information re any change of KAVNER's

status as a Teamster employee.

Inasmuch as the suggestion for interview stems from

KAVNER's possible defection and since our inquiry does not

substantiate this, St. Louls does not recommend interview.

MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

(Accounting and Fraud section)

(00 LOS ANGELES)

dated 1/25/62.

Re Bureau airtel to SACs, Los Angeles, and St. Louis,

This case was discussed at length wiüh Mr. CHARLES

SMITH, Deparimental Attorney at a conference held 1/31/62, con-

cerning the HOFFA cases presently being handled by the Los

Angeles Division. In regard to this matter, Mr. SMITH requested

that RICHARD KAVNER be interviewed. He was

advised that St.

Louis was at his time, atiempting to ascertain if KAVNER has

resigned from,

and is disgruntled with the Teamsters Union.

Mr. SMITH said he desires

to have KAVNER interviewed at this time

he, KAVNER, is or is not still associated with the

Teamsters Union. He feels that KAVNER, having handled the trans-

fer SCHEIB Workers from the IWFL, Local 886, to the Teamsters

Union, is the key to this case, and if KAVNER is willing to

furnish information, he could also be the key to many other

natters concerning une Jeansiers and HOrrA.
