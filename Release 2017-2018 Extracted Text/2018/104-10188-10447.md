Review of LIFFAT and LIE:

i. Here is the KUYUBE draft puper prepared by Paul ¥, LEVISTER
after his recent vistt to your station. It has nad the benefit of
valuable suggestions from the ces. It hec buen read with doterest by
senior LUVARY officers who think the paper illustrates the essentials,
of gvod tap operations. The stress uf the paper is on iatelligeace
collection, ut come mention bad to be usde of operntious! leads and
CI/CE information, otherwise we would have had only a partial picture
of the operations. fe will appreciate any commenti or corrections you
wish to make, jo vant to precent the true facts and convey the right

dapreesion.

2. ilaving paid this tribute to nonesty, we will adatt having

4 Finally, there was the question of the Polish lines, on which
the files are mystifying. The 1960 Project Renewal reyucst mentions

LITENSOR's desire to cover those as well as the other two, but subse~
quent correspondence omits all mention of Polish lines. id he really
wention the Polish target? If oo, how did ve manage to get out of it?

5. The tough probles, of course, will be to sanitize the paper
without downgradiog tne operations. The essence of the message is
that eo much can be done, and done well, by relatively few peop}
provided these few people have the right #szills and sufficient drive.

Fe might omit all references to Latia America, the Spanish language,

and Cuban case officers; te aight even throw in a fev sisleading phrases
like "the far-sway Cuban target.” Ye certainly vould not waat tlie
location to be recognized escept by persoas already familiar with the
operations. ‘Ye will be guided by your vishes in this and other aspects
