aboard the N/V TEJANA.

A POA was requested on

15 March

1961 for his use in PM maritime

ops as a crewman

on the

Due to cessation of

on 5 June 1962 that CUESTA was not then being used and

no indication ba pertinenter Ascine intes or his 2od file

From the time he came to the U.S. in 1960 until he was ar

rested by the Cuban Government, CUESTA was associated with the MRR,

UR, Alpha 66 and Commando L organizations.

The hit and run raids made

by these groups were well-known to all government agencies and, in

fact,

openly known in Miami because of the propensity

of the Cubans

to talk.

There were a number of discussions at the highest level

(President) concerning what should be done about such raids.

They

were not sponsored

by or connected with the U.S. Government.

Two

of these unauthorized raids are the ones referred to (attempts 21

and 22) in the article attached to Mrs. CUESTA's letter.

Mrs. CUBSTA was born 21 May 1936. in Madrid, Spain.

As of

30 March 1963 she was married to Antonio CUESTA, had

one small son,

and reportedly resided with Antonio in Miani, florida.

She current-

ly refers to him as her ex-husband, but particulars of a separation

She is also known as Mrs. Maria Viza CUESTA,

Maria Lsisa Viza Blanço and Mrs. Vincente CUUSTA..

In June 1967 the FBI advised

JMWAVE Station that she was recruited by the CUIS while

in Cuba and to hold this knowledge to a minimum because

they intended to operate her as a double agent.

She

said the pitch was made on behalf of the DSE and would

benefit both her and her husband.

sponse to her letter until he could check out the status uf the case.

It was recognized that Mrs. CUESTA could be acting in behalf of the

DGI.

tional interest in Mrs: CUESTA was terminated circa December 1974
