Mr. Vitale is presently within 2 years of retirement or

4 years, if he does not receive an overseas assignment. He has ,
told the career panel, he would accept an overseas assignment

SECTION C/Continued : NARRATIVE COMMENTS:

. For’approximately four months during 1967, Mr. Vitale
worked with me in providing Headquarters’ support to JMWAVE
in its conduct of.special operations into PBRUMEN. In such
a role, Mr. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanics,
requirements and PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was
invaluable. in (I) ‘the preparation of operational proposals
for the 303 Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational
information periodically réquested by the front offices of

{both WH/COG-and WHD, and. (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

newly assigned to JMWAVE to assist in these operations, While
under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,
cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed ali
tasks assigned to him in an. exceptional manner, He always
expressed his.willingness to work as many hours as necessary
to finish.the task at hand, He has a very pleasant person-
ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

a good sense of cost consciousness in the use of government
equipment and materials, The rating letter "S" most accurately
reflects the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the
period he was under my supervision,

2. BY REVIEWING OF FICIAL &
ZOMENTE OF REVIEWING OFFIC

Ag noted in tho last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr, Vitale's performance as listed; but T
must again note that these are ‘duties which could be performed by a
moro junior clerical type and that Mr, Vitale should not be considered
as performing GS-8 level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. . Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such a ro-e
and his official position title should be changed to prevent uny
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value to

the Agency.

SECTION C/Continued NARRATIVE COMMENTS

For approximately four. months during 1967, Mr. Vitale
worked with me in providing Headquarters’ support to JMWAVE

sin its conduct.of special operations into PBRUMEN. In such

a-role,; Mr: Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanies,—
requirements and PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was.
invaluable in (1) thé preparation of operational proposals

for the 303 Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational
information, periodicaily requested by the front. offices of

both WH/COG and WHD, ‘and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personne}
newly assigned to JMWAVE-to assist in these operations, While
under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,
cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed all
tasks assigned to him in an exceptional manner, He always
expressed his willingness to work as many hours as’ necessary

to finish the task at- hand, He has a very pleasant person-
ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

a good sense of ‘cost consciousness in the use of government
equipment and materials. . The rating letter "Ss" most accurately
reflects the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the

period he was under my supervision.

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale'’s performance as listed; but ae
must again note that. these.are duties which could be performed by .a
moro junior clerical type and that Mr. Vitale should not be considered
as performing GS-& level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient

I have. had opportunity to observe subject's performance closely
for nine months and while I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings
of the duties as listed, it should be noted that these same duties could
be performed ecually well by a more junior intel Clerk or Intel Assistant
and, therefore, the overal] rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not
accurately reflect his capability. In my opinion it would be very diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for subject to perform competitively with other
Intel Assistants at a GS:8 level, and I recommend his position title be
changed to Ops Support Assistant, a role in which he performs capably.

Mr. Vitale continues to be a most. loyal, cooperative and willing
worker, getting along well with all. hands. His waturity and esny
years of expericnce in his field, in addition. to his great general
knowledge, make him a wost valued cmployee when compared to
colleagues of similar rank. It is because of this that T have
again rated Mr. Vitale very high. Although Mr. Vitale has no
supervisory responsibilities and fully realizing his Limited
potential as a senior operations officer, I feel he is still
undergraded and should be promoted to the next higher grade

at the earliest opportunity, Because Kr. Vitales job and
performance nave remained almost exactly the same as during the
previous year, this fitness report is also very similar.

The reviewing official does not use the same rating scale as the
supervisor; therefore, would “rate subject one letter lower in the

conscientious, pleasant and has an excellent "stay-on-the=job"

Subject continues to do an exceptional Job 8 assisting his office in
the formulation of reports and plans by his research and ability to
quickly make name traces and ferret out information fraa the various

agency sources,

During the past year subject has continued to be a most cooperative,
loyal and willing worker‘om a project that due to its nuture is more
frustrating, and demands more with less apparent return than most
projects. As on his previous fitness report, I I have rated him very cy.
high, primarily due to the facet that pe dees “and ‘many years ex-
perience with the Agency have made him of much more immediate value

than most o€ his collexgues in the G3 7-9 level. Consequently, although
he has made’ G3-8 within the past ycar, I feel he is still undergraded

and should be promoted to G3-9. at the carliest opportunity.

While not wishing to detract from.the value of subject's duties
or from the manner in which he performs them, I do. have strong doubts
as to. whether the nature of his duties warrant promotion to GS-9 even
if they were performed in an outstanding manner. During the next year
additional duties of a more demanding nature will be placed on subject
and I will want to weigh his performance under those circumstances -

‘before recommending promotion. .

casual status while an assignment suitable to his talents was being located.
The fitness report for the period of his duty with the German Branch is
accordingly only a record of the fact that he loyally and diligently carried
out assigned tasks to the best of his ability.
