case, the leud of your career seivice has surloes me that

you do noi met the requirements of Ha 20-50 lor designation as a partici

pant and I have accordingly mude the fornal determinution required by the

regulation cut you are not eligible for desigation. From a revier or sour

record it appeurs that the decision of your Career Service was baseà upon

the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as

yet perfored 60 months of qualifying service as requireá by regulation. My

determination that you are not eliglble at this tine for desiration in no

way afrects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,

nor does it preclude reconsideration of you: elialbility to participate in

the CIA System if you should meet the reguirements for designation in tie

Should you desire further information concorning the requirements

for desigation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I Suggest crat

you read paragiaph e of HR 20-50 and paragrarà 5 of the Employee Bulletin

dnted 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law S0-643, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Ampioyces"

It is always possible that the records upon wrich the determinaiios

made in your cuse may huve been incomplete or inscourste regarding your situal

employment history wiil the Agency.

siter stuiing the materials cited

above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not el gi-

ble to participate in the CIA Retirement Systen, ploase feel free to contact

offlelals as your Career Service:

Tney are familiar with the dotalls en your

case und will gladly discuss them with you.

In adultion, you may wish in diso

cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Stati locuted

quarters (extension 0001). If such discussions do not resolve any mercare

you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case ke reali

considered by the Board. Ebrever, this reguest must be made within 30 aajo vi

the date si this momorandum.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

For approximately four months during 1967, Mr. VItale

worked with me in providing Headquarters'

support to JNNAVE

1n its conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN. In such

a role, Mi. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanics,

requirements and BRUMEN personnel of these operations was

invaluable in (1)

the preparation of operational proposals

for the 303 Committee,

(2)

the provision of timcly opcrational

information periodically requested by the front offices of

both WIl/COQ and WIlD, and (3)

the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

newly assigned to JMVAVE to assist in these

operations.

While

under my supervision, Mr. Vitale

was a conscientious,

his willingness to work

as many hours

as necessary

to finish the

task at hand.

He has a vory pleasant person-

ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

a good sense of cost consciousness

in the use

of government

equipment and matcrials.

The rating letter

"S" most accurately

reflects the levol of performance of Mr. Vitale during the

period he was under my supervision.

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur genorally in the

supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitále's performance as listed; but I

must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a

more junior clerical type and that fir. Vitnle should not be considered

as performing GS-3 level Intolligence Assistant work at a Proficient

rating. • Indeed, he is,

in my opinion,

not qualified for such

and his official position title should be changed to prevont a rose

misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value to

the Agency.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

For approximatoly four. months during 1967, Mr. VItale

worked with me in providing Headquarters'

support to JMwaVE

in its conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN.

In such

a role, Mr. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanies,

requirements and PBRUMEN personnel.of these

operations was

invaluable in (1) the preparation of operational proposals

or the 303 Comnittee, (2)

the provision of timely operational

Information, periodically requested by the front offices

of

both wH/COG and wHiD, and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

newly assigned to JMWAVE to assist in these operations.

While

under my

supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal

cooperative employce

who

readily and willingly performed ali

tasks assigned to

him in an exceptional manner.

He always

expressed his willingness to work as many hours as necessary

to finish the task at hand.

He has a very pleasant person-

ality,

gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

a good

sense of

cost consciousness in the use of government

equipment

and materials. The rating letter "s" most accurately

reflects

the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during

the

- period he was under my supervision.

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the

must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a

as performing GS-8 level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient

he

in my opinion; not qualified for such a roje

for

while I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings

of the duties as

listed, it should be noted that these same duties could

be performed ecually well by a nore juntor Intel Clerk or Intel Assistant

and, therefore.

the overall rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not

accurately reflect his capability.

In my opinion it would be very diffi-

cult,

if not imposible

for subject to perform competitively with other

Intel Assistants

at a G$-8 level,

and I recommend his position title be

changed to Ops Support Assistant, a role in which he performs capably.

SERGE APPERSONNE:

applicable.

Mr. Vitale continues to do an exceptional job in assisting

his office on a most complex project.

His longevity on the

project; coupled with his continued objectivity, makes his

services increasingly valuable. This is in contrast to many

of his colleagues who have transferred because of the many

extreme demands and frustrations caused by this estraordinary

project.. Mr. Vitale continues to be a most loyal, cooperative

and willing worker, getting along well with all hands.

maturity and many years of experience in his field, in addition

to his great general knowledge, make him a most valued employee

when compared to colleagues of similar rank.. It is because of

this that I have again rated Mr. Vitale very high. In addition,

and fully realizing his limited potential as a senior operations

officer, I feel he is still undergraded and should be promoted

to the next higher grade at the earliest opportunity.

Comments of Reviewing Official:

This employee had no qualifications for assignment in the German desk or

German operational field. He was carried in the German Branch in a

casual status while an assignment suitable to his talents was being located.

The fitness report for the period of his duty with the German Branch is

accordingly only a record of the fact that he loyally and diligently carried

out assigned tasks to the best of his ability.
