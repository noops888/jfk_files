On September 17, 1976, MANUEL LEONARDO DE ARMAS, by

DE ARMAS departed Utica; New York, in March,
1975 for the purpose Of obtaining employment in the Miami, Florida 4
area. He subsequently gained employment as an investigator with

‘a’ firm named Preventive Security Service. DE ARMAS explained ‘that
his grandmother presently resides in Caracas, Venezuela _and that

the 26 year old “Gaughter of B
currently residing in Cuba afd efipToyed / dirgctor of Cuban
Motion, Pictures, and thé ex-wife of aati of Venezuela.
D'ARMAS stated that MARIA has been involved” in’th eftist Movement |
in Venezuela along with 4 brothers whose last names are GARCIA-PONCE
who are considered the Leftist elite of that country. RY
pointed out that his primary réason for traveling to Caracas was
to place himself in a position where he could be of assistance to
the United States Government. He stated that in conversations with #
RIA and the GARCIA-PONCE Brothers, they discussed numerous 4
llegal activities including the possibility of drug “traffic from

8 Columbia. iL)

~ DE ARMAS returned to Miami on October 4, 1975 and discusse
the overall possibility of establishing contact with the Cuban
Government with the FBI; but in view of the vagueness of his

statements, there was little response from that agency,, He thei

as a “bombshell”. The tape was then submitted to FIDEL CASTRO i
for review and approval: CASTRO reviewed the film prior to its

submission to the Political Bureau and after CASTRO's review it

was sent back to their group for revision. A number of cuts . ‘

DE ARMAS and that for his own reasons CASTRO wanted a number

of revisions made in the tape. CASTRO's attitude implied that he
was permitting the DE ARMAS news release and pointed ,ou hat
that release was purely voluntary on DE ARMAS' part. AL)

DE ARMAS recalled, that again on his own, he made a
statement at the beginning of the press conference in which he
remarked that the statements he was making were voluntary. His
interview with CASTRO lasted for approximately twenty minutes and
he expressed a completely willing and positive.attitude to CASTRO
in the release of the press conference. He did not object in any
way to the revisions which CASTRO had found necessary. DE ARMAS’
impression from his interview with CASTRO was that CASTRO attempted
to convey the impression to him that he or the Cuban Government were
doing DE ARMAS a favor in permitting him to make the press release.

At this point in the interview, DE ARMAS explained (a
that he did not feel that the information that he furnished in
the press release was of any great damage to the United States
Government in that it contained many obvious untruths a:
misinformation. As an example, he purposely identi ftedf it i

FRED DUNCAN as an lloyee of the CIA when he is actually |
an employee of bx fie reiterated that his motivation throughou w),
all of Is activity was to ingratiate himself with the Cuban i

Government in order to place himsélf in a position whereby

he could be of assistance to the United States Government. DE ARMAS
accepted full responsibility for all is actions as. é
noted throughout this entire attair. €

P2"ARMAS noted that he had made some comments concerning:
one MARTINEZ whom he identified as a Cuban exile who left
Cubs” sometime ing the revolution and is connécted with the

Anti-CASTRO news media. DE ARMAS did not know MARTINEZ ‘and
was simply briefed on his activities by Cuban Intelligence, which
information was reflected in his news release. He also referred to

a Lola (phonetic) in the same context. He recalls having
identiffed MARTINEZ“and POLIFO as He referred 1

In regards to the ROL is} SFERRER. gurder , DE ARMAS claimed
that Abdala considered MASP as obstacle T efforts and

had formulated plans for his assassination. The possibility of |
planting C-4 plastic explosive in his automobile was explored. /
after a number of discussions, of which DE ARMAS was privy, ‘|
someone in Abdala made the statement to forget about the t
plans to kill MASFERRER. DE ARMAS stated that shortly thereafter
MASFERRER was killed when his automobile was bombed. After the |
bombing, Mr. ROBERT MILLS of the, FBI Miami, approached DE ARMAS and |
|

inquired as to any information he may have as to the bombing and whether

he was personally involved in it. DE ARMAS advised MILLS of the discussions
within ABDALA concerning the possible assassination of M SFERRER but

denied any direct knowledge ‘of MASFERRER's murder. fA) :

Cuban Intelligence were aware that DE ARMAS was affiliated
with Abdala and they also believed that he had direct knowledge of
the MASFERRER killing. As a result, during his debriefings, DE_ARMAS
attributed the receipt of plastic explosjye c-4 from BOB MILLS (whom
he purposely identifiedfas’a CIA officer tg) then he claimed that he gave(U)
the explosives to Abdala*wi'th the implicatNon that Abdala was
responsible for MASFERRER'S murder. ¢

DE ARMAS claimed that an ifdividual named ow |

The bombing of WOBA Broadcaster MOULLON, was pie oe
also discussed with DE ARMAS. DE ARMAS claiméd that shortly agter [
furnishing his press release he was naturally branded as a traitor |
by the Cuban Community in Miami. MOULION took the position a

publicly that the full story concerning DE ARMAS had not come to
light and thereafter statements concerning his treason were unfounded
at the time. About 3 days after his defense of DE ARMAS, - -
his automobile was bombed. with the result that MOULION 4
lost both his legs. DE ARMAS had no knowledge of the bombing & UB

of MOULION's car. However, the official Cuban sentiment is that———"
the bombing was performed by supa » group. The Cuban bat ™.
Government is elated over this Because TA who has alwasy been” 6ne
of the leaders of the anti-Castro movement in Miami, had now resorted to
radical terrorist action, fearful as many other anti-Castro Cubans -

are, that the United States will resume diplomatic relations with
