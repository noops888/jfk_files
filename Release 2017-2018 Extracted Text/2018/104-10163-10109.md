REFS: A.UFGA 16973, 24 July 1964
B.UFGS 1018, 6 Feb. 1962

1. Chief, KUSODA, has advised, in response to yur query contained
in Reference A, that “at this late date Subject has no recourse to over- '
turn ODACID's ruling that he lost his PBPRIME citizenship by his accept-|
ing employment in the PERUMEN Government, Tr protect the PBPRIME
citizenship of an individual who engages in activities which would
normally expatriate himself requires prior agreement between KUBARK and
ODACID. This was not done in Subject's case, Then, too, Subject, by
his application for and acceptance of 7 immigration visa to enter
PBPRIME as a permanent resident alien ig in effect an admission by him
of loss of his previous PBPRIME citizenchip".

2. The above opinion reiterates that expressed in a previous revi
of this case, see reference B, which was the basis for Subject's epplyt
for his immigration visa.

3. While we regret any past misunderstandings on the part of
Subject and, in particular, any aisinterpretations which may have beea
presented to him by his various KUBARK contacts, we ask that JMJAVE
duform Subject that KUBARK cannot now intercede on his behalf for iz
restoration of citizenship. 4
