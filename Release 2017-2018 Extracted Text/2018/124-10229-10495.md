"Buffalo, New

November 29,

JOLK

1963814

"On the evening of

November 27, 1963;

a meeting of the Erie County

Communist Party

took place at the home of Sy Rudner who lives

on St. James Place in Buffalo. Present were

Sy and Ann Rüdner', Rose and John touralchuk,

John and Ivory Mokenzle, and Marty Zelman. (KU)

"They talked about the murder of

President Kennedy. They took the position

that it was not reported in the newspapers;

but it was actually done by others in Texas,

especially those on the far right.

They

also thought that the murder of Lee Oswald,

the accused killer of President Kennedy,.

was

a cover-up and that the police could have

stopped Oswald's death.

They looked upon

President Kennedy's death and Oswald's as a

big piot.

John McKerzie said that he believed

Oswald killed Kennedy, but ris motive 1s

unknown.

Sy, Marty, and the Touralchuks said

that Oswald did not kill the late President,

but that he was framed and was being blamed

as the killer. flu)

"They talked about Norm Roggow

still trying to get into

the Communist Party.

They said that Norm does not act like a

Party person.

They criticized him for being

too open about the Party and falling to cover

his feelings about the Party.

They suspect

him because he is so very busy about every-

thing and too anxious to get into the Party

and also too active in the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People.

this makes them suspicious of him

They

don't plan to let him come into the Party,

but they will continue to check further on

him.
