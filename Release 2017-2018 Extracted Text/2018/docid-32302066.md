SECRET

FLEITES, the SNFE plans called for the gradual infiltration

of groups into Cuba in various zones until there are enough

to start operating in the Escambray Mountains, as well as

in other areas.

FLEITES said he did not think the United

States Government would object to this type of operation

raid the Cuban mainland

On May 28, 1964,

MM T-1 advised that a member of

the SNFE named

(First Name

Unknown) MURIAS said that

ELA

FLORENCIO "KIKO" PERNAS and JOSE "CUQUI/ CASANOVA were with

cube

GUTIERREZ, wherever that might be.

(FNU) MURIAS said he

knew that

GUTIERREZ was still in the United States, but that

it would be

a long time before he would be seen around Miami

again.

on May 3l, 1964, MN I-I advised that in discussing

date, ARMANDO FLEITES said that the SNFE

had only from 35 - 50 men who could be sent to Cuba,

and that

the leadership of the snre considered that this would be

suicide.

He said that it would be difficult to infiltrate

clandestinely, since the SNFE had very few contacts in Cuba.

Accordingly,

the SNFE had no choice but to wait and follow

developments.

On June 8, 1964, MM T-6, a Dominican official with

excellent contacts among officials of the Dominican Republic

(DR) ,

advised that the SNFE had requested assistance from the

Dominican Government in establishing a base of operations in

the DR for use against the CASTRO Government. Dominican

Government authorities reportedly advised representatives of

the SNFE that aid would be given any legitimate anti-CASTRO

organization if approved by the united states
