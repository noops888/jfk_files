REFERENCE: Memorandum fron 2 WS to E. Henry ‘Knoche,
dated 15 April Ig75 ee

1. In accordance with reference reqpest, we have cxamined
and summarized the record concerning a cropped photogcaph that was
considered by the Warren Commission in the course of its investi-
gation. ‘The photograph (together with others of the. same
individual) originated from an intelligence operation conducted
in October 1963 by the CIA and the Mexican security authorities.

2. Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop infor-
mation on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photo-
graph were made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the
afternoon of 22 November to the local FBI representative. Later
thet day, assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies
were Cai hae by an FBI representative on a special U. S. Naval
Attache flight to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use

"gn the ongoing invéstigation. One ph ,» cropped by the
FBI, was shown to Mrs. Marguerite | & ave. Harvey OSWALD’s
mother) in Dallas on the evening me er 1963 by an FBI
agent. ee

3. The Warren cot ae describes the sequence of

events that ultimately vesutt YS Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's

allegation that she had been shown a cropped photo of Jack RUBY

the day before he murdered her son. A further complication

4, Although “in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or His
stay in Mexico City from the morning of .27 September. 1963 to the
morning of 2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the
unidentified man originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is
important, therefore, to an understanding of the acquisition and
handling of the photographs by the Mexico Station to-review what
the Station ascertained and did with the information it developed
about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with Headquarters action on
that information. : :

5:° From all credible evidence known to this time (none,
incidentally, added since the exhaustive work of the Warren Com- i
mission), Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and two (2) I
partial days -- about 116 hours i Ay in-Mexico City from about
10:00 a.m. 27 September 2065 2s EB) a.m. 2 October 1963.

His place of residence w; oe Naa traveler hotel, not
« frequented by vortngoe Oh Commercio -- where he was “

registered tinder alias. Ex!

Qstive and detailed interviews and a

interrogation by the Mexican authorities and the FBI after the
assassination established that, in the recollection of all hotel
personnel, he left and returned late each day of his stay. :

6. Allowing for the fact of late arrival and early departure,

and assuming that he slept one-third of the time of his stay
(38 or 39 hours), theré remain some 78 hours of activity to be

7. It should be note: EEN WALD was in no sense “under

investigation." ‘None of the facts of his defection and Stay in

the USSR and return to the U. S., 1959 -- 1962, were known: to the
Mexico. Station or in its files before 10 October 1963. On that ~
date, the bare bones of his biography were forwarded by. Head-
quarters in response to a Station cabled report of 8 October
which haa forwarded,-on a routine basis, what appeared to be | a
contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR.
This was indicated and deduced from technically acquired infor-
mation on 1 October, which was the first and only occasion on that

visit in which OSWALD was recorded as identifying himself -

(partially) by true name.

in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters -- which

did not have. one either.-- before 22 November 1963.

summary logs. Full texts of sotected items require consultation
ofthe tape and either a full transcription or full translation
or both. Photo coverage tends to become available in quantity
lots which requires scanning and selection on a rapid and
accelerated basis in four or five day "peaks." One of the
"triggers" “that normally operates to focus and accelerate more
speedy review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is

the mention of a name. This was precisely what occurred in the

second of two conversations on 1,October, during which the
speaker said he was "Zee OSWALD." It was this information

reported by the Station to Headquarters in its first indication

on OSWALD ‘on 8 October 1963.

coverage of OSWALD's activity as the afternoon of the 23rd

when all available coverage had been checked?

12, The totality of Mexico Station coverage on or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD consisted of five (5) voice intercepts.

. Each of these items, including the text.of the raw intercepts,

were read by, discussed with, and examined by Warren’ Commission
staffers, in Headquarters and at the Mexico Station during a stay
from 8-13 April 1964. All were made available promptly to
the FBI.

13. At about mid-day on 1 October, the camera registered
the entry into an Embassy of a white-shirted individual. In the
opinion of the Station, among all the persons photographed that

day, he appeared to be the only non; WS and possibly American

who entered. On ie mee

14. The Station's action was not unusual and really amounted
to an analytic "quantum leap," in terms of the primitive status
of the OSWALD identification. Many examples of a similar kind of

thing can be found in the day-to-day record of Station-Headquarters

16. This obviously was for comparison at the Station
which had estimated the age of the unidentified male whose
photograph it had. selected as having the "apparent age of 35."
17. The Station meanwhile had begun an exhaustive and
accelerated review of all its technical and photographic intel-
ligence. A dispatch was prepared in accordance with the
indication given in the cable of 22 November. The dispatch ~
noted that photo coverage of the unidentified individual had _
turned up on 4 and 15 October. The text of the 22 November 1963
pouched dispatch read: nr,
