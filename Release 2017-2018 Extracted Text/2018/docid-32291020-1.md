Re Milwaukee airtel 5/18/62.

In referenced airtel Milwaukee set forth the results

of check of the telephone company for the telephone of PCI

Frank Russell. One of the contacts according to these records

was a Washington, D. C., telephone number RE 7-9775 on 4/2/62.

In handling the leads set forth in referenced airtel

Washington Field should insure a check is made with respect to

the identity of the person at the above listed telephone number

in Washington.

Thereafter, if deterhined advisable, appropriate

investigation should be conducted.

1 - Milwaukee (92-247)

1 - New Orleans

(92-36)

NOTE: Russell, a PCI of the Milwaukee Office, has furnished information

concerning the

Marcello case and claims to be

in contact with Jim

Donohue, a Washington Lobbyist.

Russell claims Donohue has approached

nim to make contacts with high Government officials in an effort to

assist Marcello in litigations.

The information furnished by Russell

is highly questionable and

as a result, Milwaukee, New Orleans and

Washington Field are attempting to verify Russell's story by conducting

discreet inquiries and checks concerning Russell's past contacts.

In referenced airtel Milwaukee set forth the results of telephonic

contacts by Russell in Washingon, D. C., including the telephone number

listed above, but did not set forth

a lead for Washington Field to

Tolson

Belmont

check further in this matter.
