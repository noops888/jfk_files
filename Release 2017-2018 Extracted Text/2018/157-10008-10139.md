Memo for Mr. Sullivan

LEE HARVEY OSHALD

105-82555

There is no indication that Lee Harvey Oswald was ever

recruited or trained by Department 13.

During interview in 1962

he claimed that he worked in a radio factory in Minsk while he was

in Russia.

His, diary and corrc:pondence to his mother ind brother

while ne was in Russia plus the intervens of his widow conflimeu

this.

•It is considered verv unlikely that Oswald would have been

recruited by Department 13 because of his suicide atremor a few

days after his arrival in Russ; his demanding and arrogant

personality and critical remarks about the Soviets contained in hi:

diary,

in correspondence with the terican Embassy in 1961 and his

correspondence with his mother nd brother in 1961-62. It is

inconceivable that the Soviets sould have used an individual of this

kind to carry out assassination of leaders of lestern countries

even if the Soviets have such plans:

ACTION:

None. The above is for information.

NEUREL.
