Identi-Kie

Going over the various debriefing reports on AYMUG-l,

it would appear that the defector has an excellent memory

and a faculty for being able to describe physical character-

cing at co

istics of many persons he has met but without being able to

remember their names. Tro cases in point are the della

and the tiberon. It occurs to us that possibly thought

should be given to using the Identi-kit as a neans of getting

pictorial description of persong whose nanes the agent

loes not recall but whose descrintions are still with him.
