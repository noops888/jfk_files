Aw@iIP arrived in Helsinki on 30 July 1962. He called HBFINCH

according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's

abysinal understanding of English), Fallucci established contact.with
AUMHIP vithout further difficulty. The meeting took place in ‘the
restaurant of his hotel, The Yaakuna, and.later in his room. we had .
not at this time located AMLASH, So the time was spent briefing AMHIP
on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH when they inet. ‘The
meeting lasted about one and a half hours,

Later the same day we called AMIRIP at his hotel tid réport
no progress in locating AMIASH. Feeling it advisable to keép AMWEIP

We arrived at the lhite Lady first, arranged for the'dinner, end

had suggested to us that'the discussions should be merely devoted to
getting acquainted the first evening, ANLASH comenced almost inmiediately
into discussion of his fpflings and, his position sondefning 0 Guba today.

the continuing existence.of a senblenco: of ‘normal functioning: in-Ciba
depended’ upon a continuing’ supply of pettoLeum, supplies of shich, ag we

of Cavllos Rodrigues and the Soviet Ambaséador, end also to eliminate Fidel,

be mich easier to efzect a take-over: . (We 1istened for'the nost part, but

to AMLASE +:

be’ raplaced by Moscow, and that the killing of the’Soviet Ambassador, would
have only the briefest effect on the Soviet control of Cuba.) AMLASH was

not too interested in listening at this point, and continued ty saying that
if he could achieve all these actions, plus others, in one waster stroke,

a take-over, during ‘the arisuing confusion, would be much facilitated,’ He
did not feel that Raul or Ché would be able-to rally the péople in sufficient

time to prevent, opposition forces frum fox

ag. His arguments and plans had
many flaws, but AMWHIP could not help admiring (to himself) AMLASH!'s
professed desire for vigorous and, hcpetully, efféctive actions, designed

to alter the situation in no. uncertain terms. While'we were making

committments or plans, we pointed out. to-AMLASH that schemes like he-envisioned

2 August, AMUASH had purposely refrained fron malting any public appearances

very disposed to play the "Public Relations" man from: Cuba and espouse the.

"peace and friendship nonsense", as he called it. However,  AMLASI! also’ sai
that he felt that he had better perform this role’to somé extent, as it wes

slow, laborious path of working through these goveitnentes however bad,
they may be, in. our attempts to guide and influence the minds of Latin



youth: AMLASH said tat he-andsretood why we take this. point

of view, but nevertheless, if we intendéd'to win the strugzle, we must
co as the Comunists.do, and disregard the archaic end docmed old-line
governments in Latin America. We. agreed that-this was undoubtedly-the
nore agressive way to deal with’ the problek, but that such ‘methods would
leave us open te the old familiar charges of interference in the internal °
affairs of sovereign countries. ‘AMLASH ‘emiled ‘and. replied. ‘that trom a
practical viewpoint this didn't make any difference, for if wo didn't

act forcefully and soon, there Wouldn't be any opportunities’ there for us

to oe open.to anything! He then cited Venezuela 'as the next) obvious

Communist victim and. thereby a loss of another 0} ortunity. for PBPRIME.
Obviously AMLASH was correct'in mich of hie thinking,’ but rather than’ steud
ing still with our shoes untied, we gave him the ball by soliciting from
him, as a former student leader and politician, any ideas he might’ have
for combating. the’ Communists in the struggle for the minds of Latin
American youth. He replied that-he would be glad at any time to! disuess
this problem and to offer what ideas and suggestions he’ could.

a. the morning of 13 August, we checked into HEPINCH to discuss
the Paris neetings with Poter J. Kymington, ‘Thru Aig good officewe were
able to arrange ge Pipenstonary surveillance of ANMIP: and AMLASH,
gaa tatign fh Fatenie, and effect other ‘arrangenents as

necessary. The ‘cooperation and help otf the Paris station fas excellent.
Following this meeting, we went to avamall bistro’néar our hotel, phoned
AMID, and: arvanged for, a nesting in our hotel toom at 1830.

getting "nérvous",. as he called 4, and will be glad to.get this business
over and done. We agreed: He wanted to remain, until the conclusions of
the talks with AMLASH, however; for he felt that, he could be of tise!in:
handling ANLASH. | We agreed. He did net, of durée, want to be! in-on

any operational discussions, but just to be on hand to, guide his

-_._.-He was. very anxious to meet Wallace A. Growery'in in‘ order’to
paint ont to him in advance sone of the quirks in AMLASH's personality:

In talking ‘to us; AVVHIP ‘said that, a person ith: nthe di leeroun



wi PASH dear, Fa for this. reason, one mgt be careful

hot to appear to be buying him. We said that-we understood this, and were
willing to advance our arguments in.any manner necessary to get AMLASH's
cooperation, but that eventually AMLASH mst ‘be made’ to:realize that,

though he is.of no little, importance te us, he is after all, the only one

man with one tion's resources: :
AMMHIP continually stressed the point that to-work with. people
Like AMLASH, it was necessary. to have them first accept a person either

by personal contact over a period of time or on. the recommendation of a

goed friend. He felt that while it was necessary for us to spend some
becoming acquainted with AMLASH,.1t also might be necessary: for Growery
to go slov at first. ‘This, we said'to AMVHIP was all right, up toa point,

- -butthat-we elt quite-enough time had been spent with’ AMLASH already,

““aHd“Ghat “the\Mbetings in Paris were, going to gét down to business quickly,
and proceed as necessary to ‘conclude business ‘as: rapidly. as possible.
We felt-that AMSHIP understood our point.
During this talk, AMWHIP again expressed the feeling that if
Cuba is-not ‘returned to freedom within two Years, he wad going to set
up business permanently in Paris’ or Southern California, and forget the
idea of returning. He was obvious moved by the finality of such 2 decicion,

but ‘said he would explain the natter to AMLASH. This meeting, it is noted,
took place initially at a small cafe acréss the street from our hotel;
s0 that we could finger AMNHIP to two suivettlantafot the Paris Station. 3
