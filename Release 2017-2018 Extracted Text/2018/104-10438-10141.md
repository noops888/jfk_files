1... According to a fairly reliable source, a senior
Cuban diplomat stationed abroad made certain charges in
late September 1977 concerning the alleged role of Cuban
exiles in the assassination of. President John F. Kennedy.
} This diplomat made these allegations to his colleagues

in the course of an official meeting in his embassy. The
diplomat said, among other. things, ‘that Cuban exiles
such as former Cuban Air Force officer D i a z Lan (fnu)
and others had been involved in the assassination of
| President Kennedy. The diplomat referred to the assas-
Is sination in the context of a security lecture in which
| he claimed that counter-revolutionary activities by Cuban
exiles have increased in recent months. He said that
| recent information had arrived implicating D i a 2 in the
Kennedy assassination. The diplomat did not mention any
| other Cuban exiles by name or provide any further detai
i]

He did not identify the source of his information, although

our scurce had the impression that the ona
tions were based on a recent cable from the Cuban Ministry

of Foreign Affairs.

\ 2, This division has no other factual information
‘concerning the diplomat's allegations. We believe that
i the basis for the diplomat's statement was, probably, an

article which appeared in the New York "Daily News" on
20 September 1977. This: article quoted Maritza

Lorenz as saying that she, Orlando Bos ch, Frank
