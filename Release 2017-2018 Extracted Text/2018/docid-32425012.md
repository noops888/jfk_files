BRITISH EMBASSY,

HAVANA.

August 29, 1963.

Dear Department,

Chancery letter 1385/63 of July 18,

1962 reported the

announcement of the signature of a Russo-Cuban Air Agreoment.

establishing an air service Moscow-Conakry-Havana.

Ao you will

be avnre from recent correspondence,

the use of Conakry as a

staging point for the Tull aircraft operating this route is

still in doubt and for many months the service operated

precariously in the judgement of some - dircotly between Moscow

and llavana.

2.

The Official Cazette of luzust 19 has now belatedly

published the text of the Air Agreement signed in Hovana on

July 17 last year.

We are forwarding an English transition

as soon as possible, with a reterence to this letter. annex

1J of the Agreenent

specifles the following routes:-

For Soviet Aircraft

(1) Moscow-Rabat (Casablanca)-Conakry-llavnna, in both directions.

(11) Moscow-0310 (Stavanger-Keflavil-Gander-Havana) in both

directions.

(111) Moscor-Havana (by the firat or the second route) and onward

to third countries in both directions

flight points to be

specified later by agreement betwoon the appropriate aviation

authorities of the contracting parties.

For Cuban Aircrnft

(1) Havana-(Gander-Halifax-Godde Bay-Montreal) Dublin-London-

Prague-Moscow.

(11) Invana-Bermuda-Azoros-Madrid-Vienna-Prague-Moscow.

(111)lovana-Port of Spain (Trinidad)-Belen-Recife-Conakry-Rabat-

Algiers-Frague-Moscow.

and

by ngreement botween the appropriate aviation authorities

of the contracting parties (nho) have the right to omit

from the establishod routes any of the intermediate points

which are situatod in the torritories of third countries.

I" will be seen that the only route in operation at present

is the Moscow-(Connkry) lavona route operated exclusively by

Rudoing nircraft.

the trague-Shannon-Gender-Havana route,

outside the scope of the prement agreement.

It will lo noticed that the Cubans probably wish to use

Kindley Field In Bernuda

in thr first instance at least, for

their proposed route (11).

I am sending a copy of this letter to Sutherland in Washington

and Chancery at Moscow, and Group Captain Rees at Caracas:
