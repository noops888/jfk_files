[could remember, Ft. Shernan was open in about August or
September 1960 to train Cubans for about a 2 to.3 month period.
There were about 40 to 50 mon, mostly ARTIME followers. When it was
docided a birger group would be noeded, which later becans Brigade
2505, these people were sent to Rotalhulou (Guatemala) xnaxath in
abont November 1960, Actually, the group was split, with sone going
to Guatemala and others, to, the New Orleans. area. As to other training
in Panama, 4 \has no knowledge, (NOTE: A |sungested that Mr.

In the case of both, they usually made x caches in Cuba, The
unilateral team, as an oxanple, would make a cache on-island, ant

In some cases, teams (both unilateral and political) would not
actually make the cache and keep the material in Florida, to be
used later at their own convenience, In‘a‘ldition, & |was positive
that sone of Castro's troops obtained some of thesn cachos, dus to
foul-ups and\snitchos. These caches containes pistols, rifles and
heavier, money and demolitions. Somo of the teams cheated by goin:
to the Bahamas and buryinh thoir stuff on small islawis and reporting
back to Florida that. they had cached in Cuba.” A tated soveral
tinos that there vas no effective control over the “political”

this, we may sursize that Agency equipment (demolition included)

d. Brigade Training: Furthor to demolition training to
nti-Castro Cubans, A. reminded mo that: shortly after tho Bri
swas ransomod from Cuba, Brigado leadors were taken to Palm Bea
and talked with President Kennedy. At that timo, the US Govt offered
Brigade mombers thé chance to join the U.S This also included
infil team members, who were completely seporate from tho Brigade, and
«members of the Brigade airforce, The Army ond of this training was
given at Ft, Banning, Geormia and began in early 1963. There, Brigade
members entered the U.S. Army at roukly equivalent ranks - officers,
wore mado 2nd Lts, They received Ranger training, plus. jump traininz.
Thus, A, said, af any exiles wore training in denolations and. related
topics, théto best training was probably rivon at Ft. Benning. Most
of these mon wero in the U.S, Army for oithor 6 months or one yoar.

ng & ‘was specifically asked about the
q tka of the Cubana airliner in the Garibbean,

A. i said the stroet-vord akong tho Cuban comminity in south Florida
48 that the bom should have gono off in the plane on the ground. ‘Tho
bombers did not mean to kill all of those people. On BOSCH, the
community does not particularly like him, but admires him because-he
thad been going at Castro tooth and nail for years. They do not like
‘the idea of terrorism and fault BOSCH and MORALES for this.

san apolitical organization, Individuals of any political shade had
been mombers and politica had not really entored Brirade Association
business. Last yoar, however, they joined with Orlamlo BOSCH, anenr
others, to help form CONG. Now, the Brigade is ombarrassed and wished
they had never joined CORU. They with-drow shortly after the Cubana
bombing in October 76. However, the damage has been done to the
Brigade Association, which A jconsiders a shame. On the CRS film
(above), A ‘said he was filmed attending an anniversary meeting.
Thitls same meeting was where CBS filmed Peruyero.

ito seo that history reflects his pobition. As indicated earlier,

A is-rather bitter against the Now Frontier, the Kennedys ant

He does not plan to fo to a publisher, whore he would xex racoive
royalty payments of around 5%, Rather, ho plans to publish on hi
.own, probably in Miami, and realize close to 100% profit. It micht
cost him kka in the area of $5,000, but he could realize a profit of
about. $30,000 depending on sales.
