of what had beon passed.

After the Bay of Pies invasion,

other catagory was "political" toans - that is politiont group: in

southern Florida wio were sponsoring infiltratione into Cuba.

Tho Agency holpod this later a catarory by riving them supplios.

In the case of both, they usually made a caches in Cuba.

The

unilateral team, as an example, would make a cache on-island, ant

another group would pick it up and use it (compartentation).

In some cases, toans (both unilateral and political) would not

actually make the cache and keep the material. in Florida, to be

used later at their own convenience,

foul-ups and snitches.

to the Bahamas and buryinh thoir stuff on small islanis and reporting

back to Florida that they had cached in Cuba.

timos that thera was no effoctive control over the "political"

eroups and thereforo no. control ofer the material riven them.

this,

ae may surnize that Agency aquipment (domolition included) was

in the handis of anti-Castro Cubans in south Florida, as

Castro's Rebel Army on-island.

¿. Brigade Trainior:

Furthor to denolition training to

Anti-Castro Cubans,

reminded me that shortly after the Brimade

was ransomod from Cuba, Brigado leadors were taken to Palm Beach

and talkod with President Kennody.

At that timo, the US Govt offered

Brigade membors. the chance to join the U.S. ary.

This also included

members, who were completely seporate from the Brigade, and

members of the Brigade airforce.

The Army end of this training was

givon at Ft. Banning, Geonzia and began in early 1953.

members entered the U.S. Army at roubly equivalent ranks - officars

were made 2nd Its.

They received Ranger trainine, plus. jump trainin.

said, if any

exiles wore training, in demolations and related

topics, thiro bost training was probably rivon at Ft. Benning.

of those mon were in the U.S. Army for oither 6 months or one yoar.

Cubann Boribing:

was specifically asker

about the

i Octobor 1976 bombing the of the Cubana airliner in the Caribbean.

A I said the street-word among

tho Cuban community in south Florida

Is that the bomb should have gone off in the plane on the ground.

bombers did not mean to kill

all of those people.

On BOSCH, the

community does not particularly like him, but admires him because he

had been going at Castro tooth and nail for yoars. They do not like

the idea of terrorism and fault BOSCH and MORALES for this.
