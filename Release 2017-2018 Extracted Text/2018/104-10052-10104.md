CURPENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

Ao

Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation

to project objectives):

*To collect operational information per

taining to LIVERICK personnel and physical

facilities."

SCANILING has continued (See

last Project Review forwarded as an attachment

to HVMA-14093, 13 November 1959) to provide

worthwhile and significant information per-

taining to the above objective.

There follow

a few examples of SCANTLING's production:

A detailed casing of the LIVERICK

electrical power supply was forwarded

to Headquarters as an attachment to

HNMA-14496,

12 February 1960.

The pro-

duction of

this type of operational

information, which

to compile accurately, illustrates

unusual talents possessed by SCANTLING

together with his valuable contributions

the Station's operational information

collection effort.

bo

SCANTLING has been used frequently

to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/

LIVERICK (now produced by LIENVOY).

For

example, in May 1960, LIFEAT indicated

that

the LIVERICK target was having con-

siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES

concerning the handling of incoming and

outgoing shipments.

By discreet investi

gation,

SCANTLING was able to provide the

Station with additionel pertinent information

about the address,

owner and type of business

engaged in by

then

the

firn.

Such information

becones readily available for exploitation

should a LTERICK shipment of particular

=2607.225

interest come to

the attention of the Station.

C•

SCANTIING is the Station's primary

investigative asset for keeping

track

of

current residence addressees of LIVERICK

personnel.

The Station considers it important

from

the

counterespionage standpoint to main-

tain information

on the location of

al1

## Page 6

14-00000

LIMERICK residences.

In addition,

specific

targets are continually considered for LICOOL

installations.

A recent example of SCANTLING's

efforts in this cornection would be the spot

ting and acquisition of the LIMOTOR base in

the same apartment building with LITAION -1.

Contributiona of this type operational informa

tion are quite time consuning due to the

necessity for checking out several apartments

that a LIMERICK individual may initially be

considering as a residence.

"To collect operational information pertaining to

other targets of opportunity,

foreign

tions and

in Mexico, personnel of intelligence interest operating

As indicated below,

SCAN TLING is also

extremely useful for collecting information on targets

other than LIMERICK:

In March 1960 SCANILING was instrumental

in locating property adjacent to the

LITABBY

installation which the Station has since

rented in anticipation of initiating photo

graphic and technical operations.

SCANTLING

was able to accomplish this assignment only

after & thorough casing and pretext investi

gations of the several

pieces of property

appropriate for such operations.

bo

SCANILING is also used to follow up

sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT

and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and

sister targets (See example

as to type

under I,A,l, b and e above).

SCANTLING was used as an investigative

asset to determine the local

a counterespionage case. of

"To exploit operational leads through recruitments

debriefings,

and surveillandes."

As examples of

SCANTLING's contribution to this objective, the

following cases.:

are Listed:

SCANTLING devoted a considerable amount

of time to his

attempts to locate Cesar

munist Country.

He followed various leads

GONZALEZ was finally identified and his

Mexico City home and business addresses were

ascertained.

See HMMA-15626, 9 September 1960,

for further

details on this case.

The preliminary investigative work

KUSODA case of priority interest was conducted

by SCANTLING.

During this investigation it

was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to

Aquascalientes, Guanajuato end Minatitlan to

obtain the information required by

Headquarters.

See the attachments to HMNT-1416,

20 May 1960g

for the results of the investigation.

4 o

In addition to his contributions to the above objec

tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support

requirements of the Station.

For example, SCANTLING

handled several of Raymond H. GERENDE's (ps) operations

while the latter was away from Mexico City during August

and September 1960.

Also, SCANTLING has been managing

the LIJERSEY surveillance

team since the departure oi

Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960.

It is hoped that

SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon

as the LITENPO project is approved.

SCANTLING bas also

been used to spot and rent safe houses for various

Station operations, a valuable operational support

service.

As stated in the preceding Request for Project

Renewal, al though SCANTLING'S LIENPTY

Project objectives

can never be completely fulfilled, it is the station's

opinion that SCANTLING has made important and

contributions to LIEVPTY Project objectives specifically

and to other Station activities in general.

SCAN TLING 's

measured against monetary expenditures,

case officer time and other intangible factors, unques

tionably justifies his continuation as an integral part

of Project LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H. GERINDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1.

"To collect operational information pertaining to

LIMURICK personnel and physical facilities

through

of photographic base houses."

Together with their

extensive photographic coverage of the ITERICK target.

the photographic bases also contribute other types of

operational information:

& LIMITED - This base compiles daily logs

indicating alt arrivals, departures and,

where possible,

---

## Page 8

14-00000

SECRET,

-4-

This information is particularly useful in keeping track of

LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of

visitors to the installation. Also, LIMITED maintains a

summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily

basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the

presence or absence of an employee on any given day.

Finally; one other significant service is performed by this

base, the radio dispatching of the LEMBRACE surveillance

team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity.

LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on

visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK

installation. A recent example of the base's contributions to

Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this

case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit

the LIMERICK target on a certain day.

The base was alerted

to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any

person appearing to be an American,

The results of this

assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other

cables. LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,

which when compared with photographs provided by Head-

quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity.

b. LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine

photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year.

In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares weekly

reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives.

LILYRIC

also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the

license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the

LIMERICK installation, LILYRIC photographs also are con-

centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees.

It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic

coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each

day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maintains

photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day

except Sunday.

c. LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the

LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational

information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK

employees and their families. Also, the base operator,

SECRETA

## Page 9

14-00000

SECRET/S

LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information

pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target

employees. He accomplishes this objective by careful

observation and analysis. LICALLA also maintains a daily

attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA

coverage of the target, both photographic and physical

observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK

personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-

espionage effort.

2. "To collect operational information and identity operational leads

pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,

handied by GeReNDE, is the major contributor to this objective. It

has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform

pretext investigations in support of numerous Station activities. The

cases listed below are cited as examples:

a. In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ, Sanchez (see l, A, 3, a, above)

LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his

Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters

provided photographs, left no doubt that GONZALEZ was the

subject of interest to Headquarters.

b. LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,

a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent

supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext

investigation of the residents of an apart ment building where

CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the

results of the investigation with excellent photographs of the

subject.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent

hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for

other Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive

area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make ):

him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities.

GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them.

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time

expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project is worthwhile and

should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational

information produced,

Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational leads

pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.

During this project year the LIJERSEY surveillance team under the

direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support

efforts through pretext investigations and physical surveillances. Some

exarples of the team's work are listed below:

a.

Communist which the team had under surveillance from

November 1959 to April 1960. The surveillance, together

with information acquired from other sources, eventually.

resulted in an unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER.

devoted portions of five months, January to May 1960, collecting

information on subject through physical surveillance.

c.

subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960.

was later deported from Mexico through the efforts

of LITEMPO-2.

d. CLACKETT and the LIJERSEY team performed numerous

pretext investigations on Station targets of opportunity and on

three separate occasions during the project year served as

a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other

operations.

2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent

about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to

LITEA-1. Although not specifically covered by the project objectives,

this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con-

tribution to the Station's support efforts.

3. In view of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31

August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to

the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project will

not be renewed. However, for the record, it is considered that

the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the

expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIJERSEY operations

were justified.

D. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to

many Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor

to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive.

The project has not

produced any positive intelligence nor has it been intended that it should

do so. The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the

development of operational information in support of other Station

operations.

IL.

• CHANGES

A. Simon D. CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has

necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance

ream and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team

during the past year. As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was

decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the

requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;

consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would

permit the Station to continue to profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.

B. Oliver G. SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the

LIJERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of

the LITEMPO project. SCANTLING has been exposed to, and likewise

knows, only one of the team members; LIEMPTY-20. SCANTLING is

known to L-20 only by an alias.

4. LIEMPTY-25 - Most recent addition to the LIJERSEY surveillance

5. There have been no other personnel changes within the LIEMPTY

project, excepting the resignations of Simon D. CLACKETT and

Wuma J. FIORDALISI.

EFFECTIVENESS

A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the

Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only

as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them.

The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as

the LIEMPTY Project, to investigate leads and to collect operational

information is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and

counterespionage objectives, The Station would be seriously handicapped

in its operational activities should the support services of such agents as

GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly

made unavailable.

B. LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-

espionage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require detailed

knowledge of the identity, activities and fellow associates of LIMERICK

personnel. The LIEMPTY photographic basehouses undoubtedly provide

more of this type information than any other Station operation.

production from LIEMPTY photographic bases and from the LIENVOY

project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads.

-9-

C. Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent

assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments and other

essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of

opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers

highly significant. It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be

sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can

be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and

apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and activities.

D. Although the progress and success of any support project depends

upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded

that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project

year.

IV. PROBLEMS

A. Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in

September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT

technicians by the Cuban Government. One of the technicians was known

to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA is located in one

of these units) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend photo-

graphic operations pending resolution of the situation. At this time,

there is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed.

The

LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual

inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA

has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a

possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians. No

other security problems have occurred during the past year.

V.

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year considerable

progress has been made in the Station's handling, i.e., sorting, indexing,

identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.

B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal

Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using

HY-PAN film in night photography. HY-PAN film was used on a trial

basis during daylight hours with poor results. Almost invariably, prints

SECRET/

---

## Page 14

14-00000

VI.

SECRET/K

-10-

from HY-PAN negatives were too grainy and, consequently, were of

little use in producing good identified shots of individuals.

In view

of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted.

It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which

all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously

used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all

base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result

of this new film.

C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE

segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments

and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is

expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim

responsibility for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his

investigative and casing activities.

The transfer of the LIJERSEY team

to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an

appreciable amount. It is not planned, during the coming year, to

expand present LIEMPTY activities.

COSTS

A.

Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project

LIEMPTY expended $19, 120. 91 during Fiscal Year 1960(1 December

1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through

31 October 1960) expended $16, 734. 69. Contract Agents salaries and

allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 1l

months of the project year to approximately $50, 000. 00. An additional

$4, 000. 00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year.

This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000. 00 for the

entire project year.

Ensuing Period - Of the total $53, 000. 00 budget,

itemized below,

$31, 900.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year

1961 and the balance, $21, 100. 00, should be expended during Fiscal

Year 1962. Normal accounting procedures will be used for all

expenditures.

EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

As regards the requirement listed in CSI- No. 230-60, Annex A, for

communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions.

the Station does not anticipate that this project would or could continue

to function under its present objectives.

However, both principal

agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile

sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse

conditions Both of these agents identify themselfs, in terms of

ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as

Mexican nationals (which they are). It is reasonable to assume, there-

fore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would become valuable contacts

in any emergency situation.
