office of Senator Roman Hruska (R., Ncb.), and told her that the picure

17. (Secret - THW) LIAISON Jack Lawn, FEI, called saying that

staff members of the House Scloct Committes on Assassinations were

bothered by the third ageney rule and could not understand why, if they

are going to see all documents, they cannot look at all documents in

possession of a particular agency, whether that agency's docuneats or

another agency's.

He asked for our position on this matter stating that

the Bureau was willing to allow committee staffers to read certain documents

located elsewhere bui wanted to rescrve some documents for readina at

the Bureau only. I told him we had not had a problem in this area as yet,

but that if confronied we would probably try to play the role of a broker in

obtaining the permission of the third agency for revicw of the documenis by

staffers and in general be as cooperative as possible within limits.
