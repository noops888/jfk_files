a commentary on the murder of KENNEDY is still working on this matter

in cooperation with Jim GARRISON.

He claims to know who the KENNEDY

murderer was. In connection with thsi OLTMANS has been the guest of

an "oil millionaire" in Texas.

According to OLTMANS he was invited there

to bring the facts to the world.

a body guard while working on this

matter.

KENNEDY's murder had had a deep seated quarrel and had fallen into two

groups.

Some details regarding this affair have come to light and it is

seriously being considered to bring them to the publicavia a l broadcast.

OLTMANS is going to dicuss this with NTS

22 February 1968

OLTMANS interview of Jim GARRISON broadcast on NTS. It is not known

whether GARRISON travelled to The Hague or whether the show was taped

in the United States and sent on tape to Holland.

The latter seems

probable, especially since the press did not report travel outside the

United States hy GARRISON:

GARRISON calm and composed, was sufficiently credi-

ble to elicit rather favorable reviews from generally well-informed Dutch

newspapers.

Several Dutch viewers also commenetd on the credibility of

his person

and presnetation. It is likely that the NTS will try to sell

this program to other Furopean countries.

GARRISON repeated well-known thesis that KENNEDY was the victim of

"President Kennedy was killed by elements of the Central

Intelligence Agency fof the United States Government."
