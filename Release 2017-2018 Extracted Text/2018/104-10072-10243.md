that Debray should be released. to a letter Ovando wrote the.
Italian novelist Alberto Moravia which they claimed stated

he would release Debray. Ovando commented to Sanjines that

he had not committed himself to release Debray. The civilians
think that the release of Debray and Bustos would take the
pressure off the government. Ovando admitted that the govern-

ihe 5. I: asked some clarifying questions on the OAS report
of a possible demonstration against the OAS Assembly in Santo
Domingo in June 1970. He said that Rolz-Bennett normally
maintains contact with the OAS Deputy Secretary General
Urquia, who is a close personal friend and is also a Central-
American. The head of the UNDP office in Santo Domingo is
Hugo Navegas. He has been asked to get the information on
the possibility of such a disruption.

6. Victor Paz Estenssoro, is one of three experts picked
up under an OAS contract with the University of Engineering
in Lima. In actuality, Paz will receive a P-4 salary from
the OAS. The project is up for board approval and will last
at least a year.

7. (wusLaB/IJwent on at length on the difficulties between
Miss Alexander, the former Bolivian ambassador to the OAS whose
parents were murdered in La Paz, and Sanjines. In brief, Miss
Alexander was accompanied to Washington by a catholic priest
Father Eduardo. Sanjines offered to find him lodging in a
Washington monastery, but he demurred. Whenever Sanjines
called Miss Alexander during crises in Bolivia at early morning ee
hours the father would answer the phone. He also helped with ants
Miss Alexander's work at the OAS and was around the Embassy
office. Sanjines once found them doing some research in his
files. Colonel Banzer, when assigned to Washington, said
that there was an intelligence report that Father Eduardo
had been involved with the guerrillas. The military finally
forced the father to leave the Embassy. Miss Alexander sent
him $100 on which to live. When her parents were killed he
veappeared.. When Miss Alexander returned to La Paz she read
a written report submitted by Sanjines on her affair with
the priest, and when she came back to Washington she called
up Sanjines.and told him off.

8. Sanjines said that his relations with the State
Department have cooled off. He thinks that the nationaliza-
tion of Gulf Oil has weakened the government. There is a
vacuum in Bolivia and this has.caused the present Bolivian
government to be much more subservient to the United States
than was the government of Rene Barrientos. He believes,
however, that his own position with the Bolivian government
had been strengthened. Sanjines is going to San Jose for
the presidential inauguration. He heard from Colonel Ayoroa
that Victor Paz Estenssoro as a personal friend of Figueres,
had also been invited to the inauguration. Sanjines said
that it would be interesting to talk to Paz.
