When the Central Intelligence Agency forwarded

to the Warren Commission a copy of Duran's signed state-

ment. It read as follows:
+++She remembered...(that Lee Harvey Oswald)
was the name of an American who had come
to the Cuban Consulate to obtain a visa to
travel to Cuba in transit to Russia, the
latter part of September or the early part of
October of this year, and in support of his
application had shown his passport, in which
it was noted that he had lived in that country
for a period of three years; Ws labor card
from the same country written in the Russian i
language; and letters in that same language.
He had presented evidence that he was married
to a Russian woman, and also that he was ap-
parently the leader of an organization in the
city of New Orleans called "Fair ***(Play) for
Cuba," claiming that he should be accepted as
a "friend" of the Cuban Revolution. According-
ly, the declarant, complying with her duties,
took down all of the information and completed
the appropriate application form; and the
declarant, admittedly exceeding her responsi-
bilities, informally telephoned the Russian con-
sulate, with the intention of doing what she
could to facilitate issuance of the Russia visa
to Lee Harvey Oswald. However, they told her
that there would be a delay of about four months
in processing the case, which annoyed the appli-
cant since, according to his statement, he was
in a great hurry to obtain visas that would
enable him to travel to Russia, insisting ‘on “
his right to do so in view of his background
and his loyalty and his activities in behalf of
the Cuban movement. The declarant ‘was unable
to recall accurately whether or ‘not the appli-
cant told her he was a member of the Communist
‘Party, but he did say that his wife***was then
in New York City, and would follow him,***
(Senora Duran stated) that when Oswald under-
stood that it was not possible to give him a
Cuban visa without his first having obtained
the Russian visa,***he became very excited or

than helping it," it being understood that

in their

conversation they were talking about

the Russian Socialist Revolution and not the
Cuban. Oswald maintained that he had two rea-

sons for
promptly,

requesting that his visa be issued
and they were: one, that his tourist

Permit in Mexico was about to expire; and

the other, that he had to get to Russia as i
quickly as possible. Despite her annoyance,

the declarant gave Oswald a paper***in which

she put down her name, "Silvia Duran," and

the number of the telephone at the consulate,

which is

"11-28-47" and the visa application

was processed anyway. It was sent to the

Ministry

of (Foreign) Relations of Cuba; from

which a routine reply was received some fif-

not true of Duran, however, because she had
been interviewed only by the Mexican police

and we considered that interview inadequate.

(I should point out that we do not consider i
it totally inadequate, however, It is only

on details such as Oswald's physical appearance,
side comments or remarks he may have made, etc.,
that we would like to interrogate Mrs. Duran
