that GIANCANA and FIORE BUCCIERI had just left his

house aiter offering him a job in New York. City which he

believed might be a

He said that these two men wer

returning to his home within the hour to get his answer. 1U

Acting on the above information, Agents of the Chicago

Office met with PATMORE and preceded him to the vicinity of his

apartment. A few minutes later PATMORE returned to his

apartment and entered. After about ten minutes PATMORE left

his apartment and spoke with the Agents.

He said that his wife

was distraught because the two men had returned to the

apartment in his absence and left a message that PATMORE should

meet them on the next day at a grill at Addison and Harlem.

Mrs. PATMORE confirmed the original visit and the return by

the same two men who left the

aborremessage. fu

message.

Agents of the Chicago Office were immediately

dispatched to the vicinity of the grill arriving at 2:20 PM.

PATMORE was not seen nor was their any activity suggesting a

meet. (u)

At about 1:00 AM, 8/12/66, PATMORE telephonically

advised that he had arrived at the grill about 2:00 PM and

had been immediately picked up by two unknown men. He furnished

a long and involved story in which he was introduced to one

"Tony the Bull" (LNU) and subsequently was taken by this man to

meet BUCCIERI. BUCCIERI told him that his job was the murder

of an individual who was stealing money from the

"outfit."

"Tony the Bull" was to be his back-up man. The "hit" was

to

take place in New York City in

, approximately one week and

PATMORE would receive $2600. V

PATVORE had originally advised that his qualifications

for this type of job were known to PAul "Peanuts'N

whom he had served time in tennessee.

At PANZCKOl's direction, f

he stated, he had murdered three inmates and a prison guard.

He said that PANZCKO had been in the Federal tier of the Cook

County Jail during 1965 when PATMORE was held there and during

this same period GIANCANA was a prisoner there. He said he had

been introduced to GIANCANA by PANZCKO who had vouched for him

as an excellent "hit man" and a "stand up guy." A review of

PATMORE'S 1965 UFAP file in the Chicago Office revealed that he

had escaped from confinement and was considered armed and

dangerous because he had stabbed a prison inmate and a prison

guard. (u)

Approved:

At about 1:00 AM, 8/15/66, PATMORE again telephonically

advised the Chicago, Office that he had been visited by

"Tony

the Bull"' a few minutes earlier at which time TONY had shown

him a picture of DOMINIC BLASI, that this was the victim, and

that the "hit" was now scheduled for Chicago and would take

place on 8/15/66 or 8/16/66.

stay close to his apartment where TONY would pick him up just

before the "hit."

Mrs. PATMORE, questioned later on the same

day, verified that TONY had come

to the apartment as stated

by her husband. (V)

The above information was furnished to Captain

WILLIAM DUFFY

Department. (U

Director, Intelligence Unit, Chicago Police

Despite certain apparent discrepancies

in PATMORE'S

story there were no existing facts known to verify or disprove

the tale.

In view of the serious nature of the information

furnished by PATMORE it was decided to follow this matter as

if the information furnished was absolutely accurate while

doing additional investigation in an effort to verify or

disprove the story. (v)

On the evening of 8/16/66, PATMORE received a series

of four phone calls from 8:15 PM to 1:00 AM from his wife who

told him she had been picked up by some men after work and

was being held. She said that he should leave Chicago and

to the Wolverine Hotel, Detroit, Michigan, since the men knew

all about the FBI. She said that if he wanted to see his wife

and child (unborn) again he should disregard his current

plans and leave town.

The last three calls were overheard by

Bureau Agents who shared the receiver with PATMORE.

appeared from Mrs. PATMORE's voice that she was near hysteria.

PATMORE appeared to be extremely shaken and distraught.(U)

Above facts again made available to Captain DUFFY,

who assigned his officers to afford coverage to PATMORE'S

residence in an effort to locate Mrs. PATMORE in view of the

seriousness of the allegations.(u)

of 8/16/66 at her place of employment. This male told her

he was calling for her husband and she should meet him at a

specified public garage at which time he would take her to meet

PATMORE. Mrs. PATMORE then furnished long and involved story

of being picked up by two men who threatened the life of her

husband if she did not call him and tell him to leave Chicago

and go to Detroit. They allegedly told her that they knew

PaTMORE was working with the fBl but he would not be hurt if

Mrs. PATMORE further advised that her confirmation

of her husband's story about the visit of "Tony the Bull" to

the PATMORE home on the night of 8/14/66 was entirely false.

No one' of any description visited the PATMORE residence that

night. (U)

Mrs. PATMORE admitted that she had received no phone

calls from any unidentified males at her place of employment

and further that the allegedcalls to her were the product of her

husband's instructions. Again she stated that she relayed this

erroneous intormation to, the FBI at her husband's direction

and out of fear of him. (Ul

Mrs. PATMORE advised that on Monday night 8/15/66,

PATMORE confided in her that he felt that the Agents were

suspicious of his story in light of the continued questioning

He then devised the scheme whereby Mrs.

PATMORE should call their residence on the evening of 8/16/66

and indicate she had been intercepted and was being held

pending PATMORE's discontinuing his involvement in this scheme

and leave town. She said that PATMORE furnished her with the

name of the Wolverine Hotel at Detroit and told her to furnish

this Hotel as the place he was to go.(u)

Mrs: PATMORE said that she left work on 8/16/66 and

visited a girl friend on Chicago's south side. Later in the

evening she placed the above mentioned phone calls to her

that he has told her wild tales of his past exploits, none

of which are true to the best of her knowledge. (U)

Mrs. PATMORE advised that she did not know why her

husband had initiated this story which he had furnished to

the FBl.

Indeed, she had not been fully aware of all the

ramifications of

his story until so informed by the

interviewing Agents. She had originally supposed that her

husband was in same

kind of trouble and was attempting to

lie out oi it. /Ud

As soon as it was clear that this entire story was a

hoax, this information was made available to the Chicago and

Detroit Police Departments which immediately ceased their

investigation. (U)

Upon PATMORE's return to Chicago from Detroit via

Greyhound Bus at 7:45 PM on 8/17/66, he was reinterviewed

by BuAgents who confronted him with

all of the overwhelming

evidence developed in this matter as well as the many

discrepancies uncovered.

For more than one hour PATMORE

continued to remain steadfast in his story when finally

he admitted that the entire story was false.

He stated

that he fabricated this tale because of his dislike for

local law enforcement which stemmed from his difficulties

during his extensive incarceration in various state

institutions in Tennessee. PATMORE was strongly admonished

in this matter and was apologetic and remorseful since he had

not realized all of the ramifications as well as the extent

to which the FBI would go to establish the veracity of this

information of a serious nature. (V)
