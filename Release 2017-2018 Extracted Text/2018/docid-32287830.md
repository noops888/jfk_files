Acting on the above information, Agents of the Chicago
Office met with PATMORE and preceded him to the vicinity of his :
apartment. A few minutes later PATMORE returned to his |
apartment and entered. After about ten minutes PATMORE left

message. Agents of the Chicago Office were immediately
dispatched to the vicinity of the grill arriving at 2:20 PM.
PATMORE was not seen nor was their any activity suggesting a
meet. 0)

At about 1:00 AM, 8/12/66, PATMORE telephonically
advised that he had arrived at the grill about 2:00 PM and :
had been immediately picked up by two unknown men. He furnished
a long and involved story in which he was introduced to one
"Tony the Bull" (LNU) and subsequently was taken by this man to
meet BUCCIERI, BUCCIERI told him that his job was the murder
of an individual who was stealing money from the “outfit."

"Tony the Bull" was to be his back-up man. The "hit" was to
take place in New York City in proximately. one week and
PATMORE would receive $2600. ( ay ;

PATMORE had originally advised that his alifications
for this type of job were known to .PAUL, Penny ts PANZERO.wi th
whom he had served time in Tennessee. At’ PANZCKO!'s direction, ,.
he stated, he had murdered three inmates and a prison guard. |
He said that PANZCKO had been in the Federal ti of the Cook
County Jail during 1965 when PATMORE was held there and during
this same period GIANCANA was a prisoner there. -He said he had
been introduced to GIANCANA by PANZCKO who had vouched for him
as an excellent "hit man" and a "stand up guy." A review of |
PATMORE's 1965 UFAP file in the Chicago Office revealed that he
had escaped from confinement and was considered armed and
dangerous because. he had stabbed a prison inmate and a prison

guard./,)

At about 1:00 AM, 8/15/66, PATMORE again telephonically
advised the Chicago,Office that he had been visited by "Tony
the Buli" a few minutes earlier at which time TONY had shown
him a pécture of DOMINIC BLASI, that this was the victim, and
. that the "hit" -was now scheduled for Chicago and would take
s place on 8/15/66 or 8/16/66. PATMORE was advised by TONY to

stay close to his apartment where TONY would pick him up just
before the "hit." Mrs. PATMORE, questioned later on the same
day, verified that TONY had come to the apartment as stated
by her husband. (Y

The above information was furnished to Captain
WILLIAM DUFFY, Director, Intelligence Unit, Chicago Police
Department. (v

Despite certain apparent discrepancies in PATMORE's
story there were no existing facts known to verify or disprove
the tale. In view of the serious nature of the information
furnished by PATMORE it was decided to follow this matter as
if the information furnished was absolutely accurate while
doing additional investigation in an effort to verify or
disprove the story.{Y :

On the evening of 8/16/66, PATMORE received a series
of four phone calls from 8:15 PM to 1:00 AM from his wife who
told him she had been picked up by some men after work and
was being held. She said that he should leave Chicago and go
to the Wolverine Hotel, Detroit, Michigan, since the men knew
all about the FBI, She said that if he wanted to see his wife
and child (unborn) again he should disregard his current
plans and leave town. The last three calls were overheard by
Bureau Agents who shared the receiver with PATMORE. It
appeared from Mrs. PATMORE's voice that she was near hysteria.
PATMORE appeared to be extremely shaken and distraught. /)

Above facts again made available to Captain DUFFY,
who assigned his officers to afford coverage to PATMORE's
residence in an effort to locate Mrs. PATMORE in view of the
seriousness of the allegations .( v)

Mrs. PATMORE further advised that her confirmation

that he has told her wild tales of his past exploits, none
of which are true to the best of her knowledge. (U

‘ Mrs. PATMORE advised that she did not know why her
husband had initiated this story which he had furnished to
the FBI, Indeed, she had not been fully aware of all the
ramifications of his story until so informed by the
interviewing Agents. She had originally supposed that her
husband was in e kind of trouble and was attempting to
lie out of, it. ii

As soon as it was clear that this entire story was a
hoax, this information was made available to the Chicago and
Detroit Police Departments which immediately ceased their
investigation. (a)

Upon PATMORE'’s return to Chicago from Detroit via
Greyhound Bus at 7:45 PM on 8/17/66, he was reinterviewed
by BuAgents who confronted him with all of the overwhelming ‘
evidence developed in this matter as well as the many
discrepancies uncovered, For more than one hour PATMORE
continued to remain steadfast in his story when finally
he admitted that the entire story was false. He stated
that he fabricated this tale because of his dislike for
local law enforcement which stemmed from his difficulties
during his extensive incarceration in various state
institutions in Tennessee. PATMORE was strongly admonished
in this matter and was apologetic and remorseful since he had
not realized all of the ramifications as well as the extent

.[to which the FBI would go to establish the veracity of this
information of a serious nature. (0)
