by

Legat, Havana (protect) as having been involved in a shooting

of a girl in Havana 11/13/58.

However, the girl recovered and

claimed the shooting was accidental and that due to this

individual's influence with the subject along with subject's

influence, the BATISTA police regime made no official record

of the matter.

Sources reported that under the influence of the

subject, SCALIA thought of himself as a "big shot and gangster"

and left Havana where he had been in a high position at the

Sans Souci Casino for no particular reason other than it was

suspected that there was a reward for unknown favors rendered

to TRAFFICANTE.

Sources advised in December of 1959 that SCALIA

had indicated a desire to obtaán a Florida State Beverage

license in Miami, Florida, possibly the "Twenty-Two Club".

It was ascertained on 3/2/61 from Sgt. CHARLES

SAPP, Intelligence Unit, Miami PD, Miami, Florida, that

SALVATORE SCALIA ran a grocery store in

• the 700 block of

W. Flagler, Miami, Florida and admitted to Sgt. SAPP that

the subject had visited him in Miami but refused to advise

the sergeant where TRAFFICANTE was staying in Miami.

SCALIA

advised Sgt. SAPP he came to the United States in 1955 from

Italy, worked as a technician in Washington, D.C., then went

to Cuba where he worked as a technician and while in Cuba

met TRAFFICANTE.

Sgt. SAPP advised SCALIA's grocery store

was nothing more than a hole in the wall, that his entire

inventory would not amount to $500 and that when he again

tried to contact SCALIA, SCALIA had sold his store, left Miami

and allegedly went to the West Coast to the State of Washington.

The Seattle Office advised by letter dated 5/28/59

egaraing intormation received by Legat, Havana, that a ROi

VARNOCK was reported making efforts to buy the Sans Souci

Gambling Casino from SANTO TRAFFICANTE in Cuba and reported

that RON WARNOCK is the brother of TOM V. WARNOCK,

Shriff of

Snohomish County, Washington 1/1/47 to 1/1/55 and that

informants have advised that since such time, RON WARNOCK has

been the "pick up" and "fix" man for that county.

The Seattle Office advised that they had a source,

EUGENE ALBERT PETERSON, close to RON WARNOCK who had also been

in contact with SANTO TRAFFICANTE

while in Cuba and who advised

that the source of capital that was to be used in purchasing

the Sans Souci Casino was from Seattle.
