(AMTURVY-4)

1. AMTURVY-4 (A-4) was part of the AMTURVY net which carried out

Fidel CASTRO.

A-1 was involved in this plan. One of A-4's close friends was

one David UTIANSKY (AMFISH-1) 201-215877. UTIANSKY'S file shows that

the Agency considered him to be "a Soviet or an Israeli agent, or both."

In 1950 UTIANSKY was believed to be not only a Communist, but an official

delegate of the Russian Communist Party and was receiving his orders from

the Soviet Charge in Havana, Dimitri ZAIKIN. Again in 1961 a request for

Security Information (CIA) on UTIANSKY stated that the Havana files indicated

that one David UTIANSKY was/is a "militant Communist." In June 1963 WAVE 9575

(IN 56919)

dated 11 June 1963, reported information from AMFURVY -4

and listed David UTIANSKY as the sub-source. In the cable UTIANSKY was

described as "old guard Communist funding agent of Cuban Communist

Party in the 30's and 40's, NOW SUSPECIED KGB AGENT.

On 6 November

(63?) a dispatch was sent from JMWAVE to the Chief, FID requesting

traces on UTIANSKY (see attached copy.)

3. UTIANSKY's close relationship with AMIURVY-4 presents problems

the latter was deeply involved in the October 1963 plot to

assassinate Fidel CASTRO. Whether or not AMTURVY-4 told UTIANSKY about the

plan is pure conjecture at this late date. However, based on the files

of AMTURVY-4, AMTURVY-13 0

and AMFISH-1 (David

CoLA vet is dote intormation to he Soviet an the of them an and

Fidel CASTRO. Again, the files give no proof of this.
