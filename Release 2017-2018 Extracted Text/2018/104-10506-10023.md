1. AMTURVY-4 (A-4) was part of the AMTURVY net which carried out
spotting and sabotage operations. In October of 1963 the Agency managed to
get a few pistols and sabotage items into the hands of AMTURVY-13 a ey
who was going to use these items in an assassination attempt agains 23
Fidel CASTRO.

2. A-1 was involved in this plan. One of A-4's close friends was
one David UTIANSKY (AMFISH-1) 201-215877. UTIANSKY*S file shows that
the Agency considered him to be "a Soviet or an Israeli agent, or both."
In 1950 UTIANSKY was believed to be not only a Commmist, but an official
delegate of the Russian Communist Party and was receiving his orders from
the Soviet Charge in Havana, Dimitri ZAIKIN. Again in 1961 a request for
Security Information (CIA) on UTIANSKY stated that the Havana files indicated
that-one David UTIANSKY was/is a "militant Communist." In June 1963 WAVE 9575
(IN 56919) dated 11 June 1963, reported information from AMTURVY-4
and listed David UTIANSKY as the sub-source. In the cable UTIANSKY was
described as "old guard Commmist funding agent of Cuban Commmist
Party in the 30's and 40's, NOW SUSPECTED KGB AGENT’ On 6 November
(63?) a dispatch was sent from JMWAVE to the Chief, FID requesting
traces on UTIANSKY (see attached copy.)

3. UTIANSKY's close relationship with AMIURVY-4 presents problems
in that the latter was deeply involved in the October 1963 plot to
assassinate Fidel CASTRO. Whether or not AMIURVY-4 told UTIANSKY about the

plan is pure conjecture at_thi » based on the files
of AMTURVY-4, AMTURVY-13 and AMFISH-1 (David
UTIANSKY) it is more than aware of the plan and

could have passed the information to the Soviets and through them to
Fidel CASTRO. Again, the files give no proof of this.
