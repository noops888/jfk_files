Dear Mr. Breckinridge:

2 us PH '78

June 1978 and 8 June 1978 that the Central Intelligence Agency

and index references to the following individuals:

Luisa Calderon

AMMUG/ 1

During the

week of 2 July 1978, various files concerning

the above-named individuals were made available for review to

Charles Berk of

this Committee.

Mr. Berk has now reviewed

Luisa Calderon's 201 file and AMMUG/l's Office of Security file,

Office of Personnel file, and Volumes One and IWo of AMMUG/l's

201 file covering the period 25 April 1961 - October 1965.

After a careful review of these materials, it has been

determined that CIA-originated reports of 5 May 1961, 6 May

1 based upon

materials provided to Mr. Berk. Furthermore, neither notes nor

memoranda upon which these reports may have been based are

present in the files.

The content of these reports, notes and

memoranda are of substantial interest to the.

. Committee. It has

also been determined.that AMMUG/1 matcrial now stored by the

CIA at its Warrenton,

Virginia facility has not been made fully

available to the Committee.

This omission came to Mr. Berk's

chris Hopkinsavertently during a conversation that he had with

intentional a open.

MI. Berk's review of a 1 May 1961 CIA-Originated dis

patch also indicates that at least twenty-two reels of tape

COMMATURE CROSIVE

recorded interviews conducted by CIA representatives with

AMMUG/1 are absent from the files provided thus far to the

Committee.

These twenty-two reels of tape recordings were

listed as attachments to the above-referenced CIA dispatch.

The actual interviews from which the tape recordings were

generated were conducted shortly after AMMUG/l's defection

from the Cuban Intelligence Service. Furthermore, three trans-

transcripts were listed as attachments to a CIA-originated re-

port of 30 April 1964.

The actual interviews upon which the

transcripts are based were also conducted shortly after AMMUG/1's

defection from the Cuban Intelligence Service.

In the case of Luisa Calderon's CIA files, CIA informa-

tional reports, cables, and dispatches referenced to in her 201.

file have been found to be absent from that file.

In addition,

a CIA transcript of a telephone conversation in which she par-

ticipated on the day of President Kennedy's assassination is

absent from her 201 file.

The absence of these reports, notes, memoranda, and other

material from the AMMUG/1 files and the Luisa Calderon files

reviewed to date may be an indication that other related

materials have not yet been made available to the Committee for

review.

The Committee therefore reiterates its request that all

files and index references on Luisa Calderon and AMMUG/1

cluding but not limited to production files, operational files,

soft files and subject files, be made available to the Commit-

tee as soon as possible.

The Committee further requests that AMMUG/I CIA case

views with Committee staff members.

As some of the matters discussed herein may be of a

sensitive or classified

nature, this communication may require

appropriate classification.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

Sincerely,
