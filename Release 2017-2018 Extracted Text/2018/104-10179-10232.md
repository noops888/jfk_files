Cubane in thefechool-and that in the opinton af

7 should be

drawn from exile organizations known to be dedicated to democratic
principles, euch as Artime's MRR, Manolo kay‘e JURE, the MAP

and MDC, I is unlixely that Figueres and

Cduber would demur. In

any case, their demurrels could be overruled, The prominont mention

of the MRR
students selected by Artime would postulat

cradle of democratic ideas and the actus) inclusion of

je acceptance af the MAUR and

All the information I have been able to cather euggeate that the combl-
uation of Munos }arin/iigueres, ae far ae Wasbinzton is concerned,
fe unbeatable and thet Artime has littie choice but to aliyn himeelf with
their way of looking at thinge--or at lexot to pay Hp service to it,

3. Another angle I would like to exvlore te President Betancourt.
The more I read of his accomplishments ae president, tee more im-
pressediam, V:hat would you think of having Artime, armed with a
letter of introduction from Fizveres, pay Betancourt # call before be
Felinguishes the presidency. Artime's approach would pot be that of o
pplicant of solicitor of support, bul that of @ young man making @
pilgrimage, sitting at the feet of a revolutionary who hee been succesatul,
absorbing knowledge of how it wae done, He could ask Betancourt, after
be {9 out from wader the daily grind of government, to addreat Kimeelf
to the problems of post-Cactro Cube. He could favite him to chair 4
seminar attended by the MAR leadership. The objective would, of courea,
bbe te involve Betancourt in the affairs of the MRK, without wutting his
pame oa the masthead and without asking him to contribute anything but
reflections of hie lustre ae 4 Latin American leader who bequeathed his
country @ constitutional and democratic regime. Undoubtedly Artine
will have to cast off [deolo,ical ballast in order to accommodate his
reluctant sponsors ((tzusres,. Betancourt), but itavana “vact bien une
mesoe."' As a minimum objective, Artime would in any case have to
strive to neutralise the Letent animosities of the moderate leit, denying
Manolo Kay an unchallenged ascendancy in monopolising its support,
which he can probably get for the asking.

4, A welcome by-product of the recusctbation of JAHART,

fe “Combate, "an influential periodical with strong readership appeal

in Latin America among elemmsnte of the modorate left, edited by
