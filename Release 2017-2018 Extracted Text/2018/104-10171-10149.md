"Millions of men today suffer horribly, with no hope"

AN APPEAL TO HUMANITY

wooden bunks, and sentry stations connected by telephone to the

Commandant's car.

These small new details are alarming, for they

indicate a special kind of calculation, necessary only in the case

of permanent institutions.

The camps make the police an imposing social power within the

State, a well defended master of manpower.

Their central adminis.

tration, the Gulas, is one of the lameet economie trusts of the

U.S.S.R. Contracts are prepared on the basis of the prevailing

vage rates, but since deportee labor costs far less, the difference

is absorbed by the police "corporation.".

Here again the inmate

of the concentration comp supports his guardian.

The Nazi SS

reached this state only at the very last stages of its existence. In

this sense the world of the concentration camp develops like a

cancer within society, corrupting the executioner along with the

victim.

A CALL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

We are laced with an international crime and we must

say so as clearly as possibile.

Our allies in the struggle for

emerges.

He is nightmarishly

typical. He is hungry, sick and afraid.

He lives in wooden bar

sacks, or under a tent, or in earth caves. His fate is locked be

twern barbed wire barricades, beneath observation towers.

Unde

constant threat of dogs and rilles, he works far beyord the powe

of his muscles. Given. neither the means nor time to wash, he wear

foul lags.

He is awakened before dawn; at night, having returnec

exhausted from work, he stands in an interminable line, near a hos

pital lacking medicaments. In the middle of the night, in every

kind of weather, he is aroused by blows to unload freight cars. Thi

is a faithful condensation of hundieds of reports-and thousand.

of such reports exist.

The world of the concentration comp keeps growing. Yester

very outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow to Baku.

During nearly their entire existence, the Nazi camps were bu

The class that organizes the camp

is not threatened with extinction. It is in possession of all powe

These camps are thu

And it is this unique quality of the Sovie

system of concentration camps which fills us with such honor.

Imagine the mass graves of the old Buchenwald erupting wit

THESE ARE THE FACTS:

Within the Soviet sphere, a system of concentration

camps exists, rivaling in extent and horror these of Naal

Germany. President Truman has stated, on the best au-

phority available to him, that the Russians hold 16 million

hopeless human beings in these camps.

On the basis of thousands of documented reports from

errapees from behind the leen Curtain, the distinguished

Franch writer, David Roussat, issued his appeal to human-

ity, reprinted in abridged form abore, for an investigation:

into the Soviet concentration camp system.

Mr. 'Rousset's demand deserves the fullest attention

of the American people. We of the Iron Curtain Refugee

Campaign have therefore undertakén to make these facts

known as a publie serice. We will not keep silent before

¡this monstrous international erime, now driving thousands

of human beings, destitute, through the Iron Curtain. Nor

shall me abandon those who flee the Soviet terror.

Therefore we call on the American people:

! (1) To join with Mr. Rousset in demanding an impartial

investigation of the Soviet concentration camp system.

(2) To support the Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign so Phat

cach vietim of this inhuman system fleeing to the West

can be assured of help by those who are dedicated to

the cause of human freedom and decency.

PROBABLY SECRET

Torges

The US Governmont's interest in the rogrettüble situstion in Iran

appears to do about 998 luminitarlan and only 2% intelligence.

Sinco the problem is primarily lamaitarian, it rould seen to fall

under a now State Dept unit which cot US$4.3 million of Hutusl Security

funds to be spont in vellaro activitles among relugees.

Although State la the aguncy of primary interest, I don't think we

need pass

this

to State becauso this 10 un official United Netons matter,.

and prosumably State already has accoss to thie sort of thin, through the us

delugation to the UN and through llaison with the ON Secrotrist. I assume

that the new rofugeo unit in State will survey the alight of rejugeos on the

Soriot perinator, and in the course of this survey will obtain this info.

Anyray, It 1s not our

Job to colloct fion the uii and deliver to state.

I would suggest that these papers be given by memo to OSO, which

might not otherwise got them.

1lso, you might as' OSo to call to the attention of the Chief,

Defector Coordination Branch, EE Division (tlat's Gale V. Allen) the paragruph

marked with a peperolio which says that Iran may have handed back to the ISsR

35 Soviet avlators during 1951. If 35 Soviet fliers did shor up in Iran last

yesr, they vere prime intelligence targots anil Gale ought to find out why

they were turned brek when the US would have taken them of Iran's hands.

Gale may bo in this afternoon, and I'll tell his jou here this report.

Anti-Communist Work of David Martin,

snd the

International Rescue Committee

Christocher Binet

Mender of the Board of the I.R.C.

Two years ugo the International Rescue Comnittee started Its

Iron Curtain Refugee Cunpuign under Adntral Byra, which has con-

tiaues under the Chairmanship of General Spantz.

uhts year, in

response to an Increasing need, the Committee launched an extended

program to raise fuids to set up reception centers for refugees along

the Iron Curtain, to be krown as Frontler Freeson Stations.

head of the Free Europe Committee,

this project as a most

vital and neglected phase of the right aguinst comunist aggression.

Mr. Jackson pointed out that one of the most successful subjects of

Soviet propaganda was the nezlect of the anti-Commist refugees In

the lest, a neglect which maises a mockery of our professed sympathy

for the englaved peoples.

The Iron Curtain Campaten Is not only necessary to encourage and

best use of the anti-Conmunist refugees, it is also

dranstic and persuasive kind of anti-Communist propaganda in America

and throughout the Western world by publicizing the versonal stories

of those who risked their lives to choose freedon.

tarian and only indirectly political, out the political effect 1s all

the greater for that reason.

Elinor Lipper, whose book "Eleven Years In Soviet Prison Camps"

is the most authentic document on soviet stave labor

has come to this

country to help raise funds for these Frontier Stationg.

However, ber

fore her arrival, evidence of & whispering campaiga against the Inter-

national Rescue Committee became clearly apparent.

Before the dinner

for Niss Lipper on October 3lst, which was addressed by General lede-

Presideat of the General Federatlon of lomen's Clues,

Governor John Lodge of Connecticut and Nr5. Hiram Cole Houghtan,

were confidentially approached in efforts to dissuade then from co

operating with the Committee.

Most of the rumors and criticisms were based on the alleged nar

equally dangerous that the IRC was or might be & aisguised Communist

It was also alleged thut David Martin, Executive Director of the

under the name or bard levee and diathe

and that he nac

nare to Martin in order to cover his Communist past.

the tacts are that David Martin, who was born and educated in

Canada, never had any connection with either the Canadian or the Amer

Canadian labor movement in his youth, but he was never a Communist

In 1930 at the ere uf thenty-rive he wrote

Canadian Connunist Pirty for TIME asgazine and has been one of the

most militant and erfective anti-Camunists in the world ever since

as wili appear from wait follows.

Se changed his nure when the rest

of his family wished to do so and far from making a secret of this he

explicitly states it in rshors kho".

Souice of tharres

The orlgin of the attacks on Nartin and the IRC have been truced

to Czarist bhite Russian sources, with an anti-Semitic background,

are affillated with like minded growes in America.

täcks have been by word of mouth.

Ine only document ve have discovered

is an anonzous attack on the IRC which purports is be written by a

British Intelligence Officer®

This atticks Eugene Lions, head of the

Comnittee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russiag

and charges that

Lyons, Martin and the Stute Departent are all engaged in a plot to

back Russian Sociolists to the exclision of all other anti-Communist

refugees:

the absurdlty of the charges becomes apparent from the fact

that Eugene Lyons himself shares Mr. Hooverls ccononic views and rorks

for the READER'S DIGEST.

Willian Zenry Chemberlin, a member of the

-Lyons committee,

is a columnist for the hAlL STREET JOURNAl and an

editor of the conservative nows letter, HUMAN EVENTS, and Isane Don

Levine, a leading

representative oi the Lyons committec in Europe,

nolas sitar conservative economie views,

as reflected in the edi

orial policy of PLAIN TAlk magicine of which he was founder and cditor.

Nevertheless,

absurd as the charges are, they have been highly

effective, because

they have been circulated

by some people with im

portant social and

business connections among business men who know

nothing of the confused Fussian retigec pleture.

When so many demands

are mide for funds in connection with anti-Communist and humanitarian

causes the mere element of doubt is surficient to prevent donetions,

and most people haven't the time or interest to make a detalled 1n-

vestigation.

Mr. Vadin Makaroff,

a Russian Czarist refugee who is married to a

rich American woman who

1s socially well connected

has been the most

active promoter of the attack.

He has boasted that he cost the Iron

Curtain Campaign $200,000.00 by his efforts with one group of fifty

very rich business men, who had been ready to contribute generously

after hearing Miss Lipper at = meeting of

roff's political viens and background can be judged by the feet that

he 1s a Director of Merwin K. Hart's organization.

The attcks have been very sillfully timed because General Spaatz

had reluctantly agreed to becone Chairman (since he hates public speak-

etco) and oniy consented to serve for one year because of the ex-

ceptional political laportance of che Iron Curtein Refugee Campaign.

His term of office lapsed in November..

Meanwhile the smear campaign

has made it virtually impossible to set a nen Chairman of national

stature becsuse the need to investigate and combat the charges will

make greater denands on the Chalran's time.

In the absence of a new

of similar standing the salse prescion is conveyed that Gen-

eral Spaats resigned because he disapproves of the Comnittee.

Another reason why the attick is damaging is that the Frontier

Freedom Stations project is so greas in scope, and the

suns required

If they do resign other Conservatives will probably so with them,

and It would mean that it Is now virtually impossible to maintain

So 1f

this attack is successful in wrecking the Campaign for the Frontier

Freedom Stations,

1t will prove to be oic oi the most tragic mistakes

among the mony lost opportunities in the fight sgainst Communism. Here

are

the

facts to meet it, focts which can ensily. be verified and which

do not depend on my own memory alone.

it has been

almost the only Americon group to sid and resettle anti-Communist as

As such,

Mr. K. D. Hetcalf, Director

Canbridge 33: Mass.

IRi- F5561

Dear Sir,

I sisb to acknowledge your litter of 21 August 1951, in which you

set forth the interest

of the Harvard Univercity Library in recuring cer-

tais docusents or microfiins tbereot of individual displaced persons o.

refigees. bo have been oi concern to the Interrational Refugee Organiza-

I urderstand fully your interest in recuring these dociments. and

while I vould 11k; lu comply with your request I do not think it will be

possible to do so for reasors which I will set forth celow.

The quertion of documentation of individual refugces and of ac-

cesc to such documente has veen a matter of concideraole controversy ever

since 1945, first in UNRRA and later in the IRO. As a result of basic dil-

ferences in political views concerning the hardling of displaced persons

and refugees it has been recessary to safeguard all individual dossiers

with the createst of care.

These dossiers contain not only facts about tke

Individusl refugee and bie timediate fanily, vut also about his reistives,

many of who are not displaced persons and are chill in their countries of

origio.

As a natter of fact, the Organization bad a great denl of diff1-

culty in securing the cooperation of individual dirplaced persons 1n cos-

pleting ou: Registration Forns, because of the fear thet there refugees bad

that such data night fall into

the hands of individuals, institutions or

goverments which might take sunitive action agairst relatives of displaced

persons refusing to return to

their country of orizln. The IRO assured all

displaced persons that their perconal records and docuncuts vould he sale-

gurded to as gent an extent as poseible

and world be made available to

goverments only for the purpose of directly

assleting in securing the re

settlement acroed of the i:dividual concerned. We have attempted in every

wey to foller this policy consistently.

As ve approach the end o? IRO opcratione, ve are makiag plaus for

the

disposal of tbe

Individual case records either by giving them to govern

ments la the couatrles of reception, or y dectriction of the recoris. or

where the refugees are

still in Germazy or Austrla, by turcing the documents

over to the United Kations high Connissioner for Refugees. I regret tbere-

fore thas lu view of the security factors Involved, 1t will not to possible

to agree to jour proposal that certain oi these indliidual records be made

available to you for purpores of historicai researcia.

I migit add, 1f you will permit an expression of opision on the

aunject, that unless you here to secure a complete set of records, it 1s

wost unlikely that the type o saipling auggested in your letter would

a theme stressed over and over again invan

effort to reconcile the victims of Red tyranny to their

fate, and more particularly to discourage them from

attempting to escape from bondage.

Even without propaganda, the risks Involved in flight

from the Red bloc are enough to deter all but the most

spirited. If they are not shot down by the frontier

guards, they are sent to a living death In Siberia. Never-

theless, from 500 to 1,500 people risk ther lives

de to bring emergency aid to the many thousarids

of human beings who are risking their lives to

escape Soviet terror and brutality, he added this

significant fact:

*Among

them

are people who have been

and can be of the greatest assistance lo us in..

providing us with an understanding of the Sovict

mentaliry as well as with vital intelligence.on

whas is happening behind the Iron Curtain.""

Gen. Spantz cited the cases of three eminent

Russian

scientists who had been assisted by

the Intemationai Rescue Committee after their

escape.

One, lie said, was among "the foremost

Russiani nuclear physicists under whose direc-

tion a vital program of nuclear research was

carried out at a major Russian university." An-

other, he said, was "engaged in important geo

logical surveys in the Tashkent area of

the

U'SSR, now beliered to be a proving ground for

Soviet atamic experiments."

The third, accord-

ing to the general, was a "very prominent geolo

gist" who had surveyed Arctic aress of the

USSR "now' reported to bo the siles of secret

air bases."

Lest anyone be learful that the Soviets are de-

liberately, planning-the escape of enemy agents

under the guise of relugces; Gea. Spaatz said

thal, with the screening given by the goveri

ment, there was slight chance that chemy ogents

could enter this country as, refugces.

The .or-

ganization gives aid only to those who, in addi-

tion so being anti-Communist, have given indi-

cation of their opposition to Nazism.

Hence we have here & campaign which ought

to appeal t0 every Amencan.

It not only offers

help to refugees from Red oppression, a most

charitable undertaking, but it serves to increase

the security of the United States and the remain-

der of the free world.

'Freedom to Starve?.

Large numbers of Russian natural

American Intelli

would quit the Soviet

empire for the freer air of western

democracies if they could be sure of

jobs to support themselves.

-The potential value of these people

with their knowledge and skills in the

struggle to protect the world against

Communist

tyranny is inestimable.

Some of them who recently have come:

through the Iron Curtain and to the

United States include a leading Rus

the strictness of American immigra

could be of immense value to the free

powers,

would

like to leave Soviet

Russia or its satellites, but dare not

do so because they do not know

whether, being destitute, they can

find the means of survival. To them,

and to thousands who lately have

fied from Soviet-dominated countries,

Communist propaganda shouts that

"political freedom in the West means

"freedom to starve.'"

If that is all that awsits them, many

will accept terror and misery under

Communist rule rather than risk pove

avoid the bitter fale or being compelled

A humanitarian enterprise. the work

been helped are men of scientific attain-

We would be a wretched nation indeed

Il we voiced our conviction that our

are constantly liceing their Cammunist

Thal's why the Interna-

and that is why in is in the middle of

its fron Curtain Refusee Campaign.

This group is set up to help those who

manage to escape with their lives in

their desperate flight to freertom.

We must all help this good work. Gen.

paign, put the situation in a lighe thit

"The wore wolich the camigran ls ds.

Judging from the valuable informa-

has a good point.

BERLIN (Western Sector):

In response to the Communist thraat to take over Berlin

by means of a Soriet Whitsuntide youth invasion last May, the

Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign launched "Project Berlin."

Replying to a special appeal, indiridual Americans and American

business enterprises contributed enough fo permit the shipment

of almost 4,000;000 Ibs. of butter, cheese, milk and egs ponder.

This aid and the continuing

sarrices of all kinds are administered by our Berlin office in the

for West os possible with a viem to establinhing a manimum die-

tance berween themselves ond the Communist pollce apparatus.

Since there are no camps of any kind in the Paris area, Phe 60,000

refugies there are among the most destitute in Europe.

Hum-

dreds of these escapeeo come to the IRC' Iron Curtain Refugee

Compaign office every reception morning to ask for food parcels

or clothing or advice. On the buniest morning this yoar, 500 food

pnrcels were given out. Very frequently escapres are sided in

establishing themselves in amell businesses or in thair own pro

fession in France, or in arronging for their migration do other

countries where they can make a fresh start in life.

To assist in the work of the Paris offico, a Committes of

American ladios has been sot up under the patronage of Mrs.

David Bruce, wite of the American Ambassador to France.

The Committoe is nt present endenvoring to establist a hostel

that will provide emergoncy shelfer for new escapees arriving in

the Paris area.

The International Rescue Committee also maintains offices

in STOCKHOLM, BRUSSELS, ROME AND LONDON, "here the

samo humanitarion services are made available to Iron Curtain

retugees.

THIS VITAL WORK OF AID MUST CO ON. So long ae Sortet

perate flight to freedom.

Millions are being expended by the U. S.

Covernment and Individual Amerieans lo counteroet the big lie of

Soviel propaganda with. the trith of freedom.

But truth la more

than worde. Undersourinhment, lack of decent clothing and shelter,

the lack of concrete evidence of Western support and approval,

could make there human beinge vulnerable to the continuous

streams of Soviet propaganda that political freedom in the Wert

menna "freedom lo marve." Prattlings about freedom mean little

to starving men.

TURKEY: Office in Istanbul.

For refugees coming from the Balkan countries and southern

Russia, Turkey is the nearest and in many cases the only country

which affords immediate asylum. To escape to Turkey phey must

cross some of the most perilous frontiers in the world. On the

Bulgarian frontier it. is estimated that 80% of those attempting

to escape are shot down. The hundreds that do succeed in escap-

•ing are completely dependent on the IRC's Iron Curtain Refugee

Campaign because this is the only American relief organization

which maintains an office in Turkey.

FRANCE: Office in Paris.

The Paris office has become one of the chief centers for Iron

Curtain refugees, because many of those who escape travel as

against Soviet Byranny will strengthen our country's prestige

But beyond this, our help to there men and women throt
