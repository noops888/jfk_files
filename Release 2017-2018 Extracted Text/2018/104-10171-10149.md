is absorbed by the police “corporation.”. Here again the inmate
of the concentration comp supports his guardian. The Nazi $$
reached this state only at the very last stages of its existence. In

this sense the world of the concentration camp develops like a .

cancer within society, corupting the executioner along with the

victim.

ACALL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
We are’ faced with an jriternational crime end we must

say so a5 Clearly as possible. Our allies in the struggle for
freedom ‘are being sy:tematically exterminated. It is our
the ! :

Out of the cacophony of the thousands of documented reports,
«the “concentration camp man” emerges. He is nightmarishly
. typical, He is hungry, sick and afraid, He lives in wooden bar:

tacks, or under a tent, or in earth caves, His fate is locked be.
tween barbed wire barricades, beneath observation towers. Unde:
constant threat of dogs and rifles, he works far beyond’ the power
of his muscles. Given.neither the means nor time to wash, he wear
fouliags. He is awakened before dawn; at night, having returned
exhausted from work, he stands in an interminable line, near a hos.
pital lacking medicaments. ‘In the middle of the night, in’ every
ind of weather, he is aroused by blows to unload freight cars. This
is a faithful condensation of hundreds of reports—and thousands
-of such reports exist,

The world of the concentration comp keeps growing. Yester
day the Soviet Union had only political. detention camps. The
cruel civil wer of the collectivization period started her on this en
terprise of forced labor. which plays its part in every economic sec
tor, including scientific research. “The present network of camp:
spreads acrass Siberia to the White Sea and the Baltic, from th
very outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow to Baku.

During nearly their entire existence, the Nazi camps were bu
‘one apocalyptic aspect of a general pathological pattern. Onl.
during the last years did they become an integral part of a seaiet
founded on anew type of human exploitation. In Russia this devel

is not threetened with extinction, It is in possession of all powe

"TO THE FREE WORLD

REFUGEE LEADERS PLEA

We, the undersigned representatives of the European peoples subji
gated by Communist tyranny, urgently appeal-for support for the tron.
Curtain Refugoo Campaign of the International Roscue Committes in
its prosent emergency. a ‘

The nature of the escapee's first contact with the Western world is
of the greatest importance. Ordinarily he reaches the free sida of the
Iron Curtain completely without means and emotionally and physi-
cally exhausted from his-harrowing ordeal. Altheugh he may bo kont
clive in overcrowded camps, all too frequently ho exporiencas avi
almast total personal indifférence that embitters even the strongest
soul. :- a” me

It is hardly ‘possible to exaggerate the value of the service which
the international Rosevo Committoe has randored to thosa who have
succoodod in escaping from bohind the Iron Curtain and to those who
have sufferad und continue to suffer in the fight for frosdom and
democracy. ae :

The promptnoss with: which the laternational Roseue Committoe
has come to the assistance of those who have escaped, and the
warmth and understending displayed by its representatives have
beon a source of great spiritual encouragamant for tho: refugees In
Europe. It has demonstrated to them that on their way to freedom they
have not been abandoned to their fate. It has confirmed their faith in
democracy to the point where subsequent hardships could not destroy
it, It has proved to the world that-the tight of asylum is not a mere
formality devoid of human.centent. It has helped to keop clive hopo
for tomorrow in the breasts of all peoplos who are today enslaved
by Communist tyranny,

't would be a catastrophe of tho first order if this vital work wero to
core to an end for.lack of funds. The hardships of the refugeas would”
be increased many fold: nd the Communist propagandists would
gloat over the fact in many editorials and radio broadcasts,

PROBABLY SECRET

Tho US\Governuont's interest in.tho regrettable situation in Iran

appears to to about 93% Iumanitarlan and only 2% intelligence.

Since tho problem is primarily humnitarian, if would seen to fall
uixier a now State Dept unit which got USH.3 million of Mutual Security

funds to be spent in welfare activities anong refugees.
Althnigh State is tho agoncy af primary interest, I.don't think we
need pass this to State because this is an offtetal United Nettons matter,
and prosumably State already has accoss to this sort of thing through the US
dologation to tho UN ané through Liaison with the UN Secretariat. I assume
that the new refugee unit in Stato will ourvey the plight of refugeos on the
Soviet perimeter, and in the course of this survey will obtain this info,

Anyvay, it is not our job to collect from the UN and deliver to State.

I would suggest that thoso papers bo given by memo to 050, which

might not otherwise cet them.

Also, you might ask 0S0 to call to the attention of the Chief,
Defector Coordination Branch, EE Division (that's Gale W. Allen) the paragraph

rerked with a peperclip which says tht Iran may Inve bonded back to the USSR

35 Soviet aviators during 1951. If 35 Soviet fliers did show up in Iran last
year, they were prime intelligence targots and Gale ought to fini out why
they were turned beck when the US uould have taken then off Iran's bende.

Cale may be in this afternoon, and I'll tell hin you leve this report.

MEMOR/.NDUM

on. the
inti-Comumist Work of David Martin, snd the \
ar: Rescue Comittee \

oy
hristosher Enuet
Member of the Board of the I.R.C.

Two years ugo the Intérnational Rescue Comaittee started its
Tron Curtain Refugee: Gump: under Admirel Byrd, which has con-
tinued under the Chairmans'’ of General. Spaatz. This yecr, in
response to an increasing ried, the Committee launched an extended
pregram to raise funds to set up reception centers for refugees along
the Iron Curtain, to be knowh as Frontier Freedom Stations.. Thirty- !
two Governors are among the sponsors of this program. C. Ds Jackson,
head of the Free Euroze Comilttee, has hailed this project es a most
vital and neglected phase of the fight against Commuist aggression.
Mr. Jackson pointed out that one of the most successful subjects of
Soviet propaganda was the neglect of the anti-Commmist refugees in i
the West, a neglect which makes a mockery of our professed sympathy i

for the enslaved peoples. :

The Iron Curtain Campsiga is not only necessary to encourage and
make. the best use of the anti-Communist refugees, it is ulso the most
dranatic and persuasive kind of anti-Communist propsgunda in America
a throughout the Western world by publicizing the personal stories

f those who risked thelr lives to chodse freédon, Its work is humani~
tesian and only indirectly political, out the political effect is all

the greater for that reason. :

Elinor Lipper, whose book "Eleven Years in Soviet Prison Camps"
is the most authentic document on Soviet slave labor, hes come to this
country to help raise funds for these Frontier Stations. However, be~
fore her arrival, evidence of a whispering campaign against the Inter-
national Rescue Committee became clearly apparent. Before the dinner
for Miss Lipper on October 3lst, which was addressed by General wede-
meyer, Governor John Lodge of Connecticut and Mrs. Yiram Cole Houghton,
Presideat of tne General Federation of Women's Cluos, all the speakers
were confidentially approached in efforts to dissuade them from co-

operating with the Comaittee.

Most of the rumors ond criticisms were based on the alleged nar-
row Socialist nature of the IRC policy and personnel. It was said
thet the Frontier Stetions would only help "Socialist" refugees. It
was even intivated by some who regard Communists and Socialists as
equally dangerous that the IRC wes or might. be a disguised Communist
front.

It was also alleged thet David Martin, Executive Director of the
IRC, had once been an active member of the American Communist Party
under the name of David Levine, and that he had sseretly changed his
name to Martin in order to cover his Communist past.

The facts are that David Mertin, who was born end educated in
Canada, never had any connection with either the Canadian or the Amer-
ican Communist parties. He was a Socialist and active in the
Canadian labor movement in his youth, but he wes never a Communist
and he is a Socialist no longer.

most militant and cetive anti-Communists in the world ever since

The origin of the attacks on Nirtin and the IRC have been traced
Czarist hhite Russian sources, vith an anti-Semitic beckground, who
afe affiliated with like minded groups in America. Most.of the at-=
tacks hsve deen by word of mouth, Tne only document ve have discovered
is an anonyndls attack on the IRC which purports to be written by a
Sritish Intelligence Officer. This attacks Eugene Lyons, head of the
Comittee for the Liberation-of thé Peoples of Russia, end charges that
Lyons, Martin and the ’State Department are all-engaged in ‘a plot to
back Russian Sockalists to the exclusion of all other senti-Communist ~
refugees. fhe absurdity of the ‘eS becomes apparent from. the fact’ -
that Eugene Lyons himself shares Mr. Hoover's economic. views and works
for the READSR'S DIGEST. Willian Senry Chemberlin,. a member of the
«Lyons committee, is a columnist for the WALL STREET JOURNAL and an
editor of the conservative news letter, HUMAN EVENTS, and. Issac Don
Levine, a leading’ representative of the Lyons committec in Europe,
holds similar conservative economic views, as reflected in the edi-
torial policy of PLAIN TALK magesine of which he was founder and cditor.

Nevertheless, absurd gs the chatges are, they have been highly
effective, because they have been circulated by some people with im-
portant socinl and business connections émung business men who know
nothing of the confused Russian refugee picture. When so many demands
are made for funds in connection with anti-Communist and humanitarian
causes the mere element of doubt.is sufficient to prevent donztions,

they are still far from adequate. : :

Imuediately after the close of the work of tite Mihatlovich Commit-
tee, Duvid Martin went to Englund, Germany and Italy to investigate the
plight of the Yugoslev refugees from Tito, and of other unti-Communist
refugees. On his return he organised with me the Refugees’ Defense Com=
mittee, which fought. the battle of the anti-Cornimunist refugees from be-
hind the Iron Curtain, including the Russians who were being repatriated
ta°Russia under the Yalte Agreement. against their will, and who were
diserisiinated against by UNRRA. Mr. Martin was the Secretary of the
American Committee and did practically all the work. We collaborated
closely with’ the British Refugee Defense Committee, headed by Lord Halifax.

i a :
‘i As the attached clippings show, our Committee eccomplished almost

the only really effcetive end widely publicized work in exposing the

Communist infiltretion and exploitation of UNRRA in some countries.
Mertin actually suéceeded in reversing some of UNRRA's policies in re=

gard to the repatriation of unti-Communist refugees behind the Tron

Curtain. To do this effectively required immense work, research and

documentstkon for which Duvid Martin was almost wholly responsible.

Mr. Martin also worked with the leaders of tne International
Peasent Union and helped to draft and publicize their appeal to the
UN to investigate Soviet persecution in their coumtries (in the Balkans
and Central Europe) on September 29, 1947. This appeal was carried on
the front pages of the New York newspapers and was widely reported
throughout the world. It set a precedent for other similar eppeals.

Mertin also organized a Committee to ald the Baltic University-
in-Exile in Western Germany. This University wes then the sole agency
to preserve the culture of those small countries which were the victims

of Soviet aggression and. Genocide.

Record of the Internutionsl Rescue Comalttee

In 1948 David Mertin hegan to work professionally for the. Inter-
national Rescue Committee, waile continuing his volunteer work for the
Refugees! Defense Comaittee, He worked at first as Assistant Director
of. the IRC under She’ Strunsky, niece of the late Simon Strunsky, whose
witty and conservative column "Topics of the Times" appeared on the ed~
itorial pase of The New York Times. Lcter Martin becume its. Executive
Director efter Miss Strunsky eccompanied ner husband to Europe. Martin
had used sll the proceeds from nis book and articles in his work for

the Refugees’: Degense Committee.

Although the. International Rescue Committee is < straight relief
and resettlement organization, not a political comaittee, it has been
almost the only Americen group to sid and resettle anti-Communist as
well as anti-Fescist refugees, regardless of religion or nationality.
As such, its work has not only rendered a great humanitarian service,
but, indirectly, it has also rendered a great nolitical educztional ser-
vice to the anti-Communist cause, by publicizing the sufferings of the
victins of Soviet persecution and explzining why they sought to escape,
or refuses to return. Other great relief organizations, such as the

holic War Relief Services, have rendered < Similar service,

Since the War it hes been ‘stesdily broadening its bose to include |
more conservative elements. David Msrtin his been in the forefront of
this movement within the Committee a he set up the Iron Curtein Refu-
gee Campaign Copmittee, first wicer siral Byrd, later under General
Spaatz, which included thirty-two Governors and many Senators of both
parties.

David Martin has worked closely with leaders of the Catholic Church
in all his work for anti-Communist refurees since the Wer, particularly
with the editors of AMEKLCA, the Natlonsl Jesuit weekly. AMERICA has
pudlished articies of his. Ne took an sctive part in the protest a-
gainst the trials of Archbishop Stepinac snd Cardinal Mindszenty. Al-
though his-book on Mihailovich und Tito wes written from the pro-Serbian
point of view, he showed his fairness by his reference to Archbishop
Stepinac, who was unfairly atteeked by many of the followers of General
Mihailovich because of the feud between the Serbs and the Croats.

To sum up ~ the facts abont Martin are that he was never 2 Com-
munist, although he was a militant Socislist in his youthful college
days. ’He has been an cctive anti-Cemmmist since 1939, when he wa
twenty- ~-five years old, dohas done wiiuue and pioneering enti-conmuni st
work at a time when it was highly unpopular to do so, both In the case
of Mihailovich and in the cause of his controversies with UNRRA and with
the British Covernment, over the repatriation of. anti-Communist refu-
gees. Hc has been one o1 the most creative, courageous and tircless
workers in the fight for freedom against Communist tyranny.

fifteen or more. sm:ll committees representing each polltical purty na-
tional group fighting with each other for priority and continuing na-
tional rivalries and ideological divisions in the refugee field.

There are four things which would cure the present crisis:

(1)° A decision by Mr. Hoover to remain on the Committee and to
give a letter stressing {ts importance, which could be used in anew
advertisement. a

(2) An agreement by Generel Spaetz-to remain temporarily as
Chatrman to give tire to get the right man.

(3) Action by the Central Intelligence Agency and the State De~
i partment to refute the false attecks on the IRC, and

(4) -An active stand by the Government to appeal for financial
Support of the Iron Curtain Campaign similar to the support which it
gave to the Committee for a. Free Zurope. -Some direct Government funds
under the Kersten Amendment to the Mutual Security Act should also be
spent through the Iron Curtain Comittee, since these sums were in-
tended in part for aid to anti-Communist refugees.

Departzent officials. These include: Advisory Conmittes on Voluntary foreign Aid;

sonted by Hr, Lawrence. Dawsons Eastern European Division, represented by Mr. Cacapbells

‘people are described by Kartin as being favoratly disposed toward the project of thé
Frontier stations, pending reactions from the field. Martin is currently in Kash-

: Tish to acknowledge your l:tter of 21 Auguet 1951, tn vhich you
eet forth the interest of the Harvard Univercity Library in cecuring cer-
tais docuserts or microfiins thereof of inéividual displaced persona o-
refigees.vho have been of concern to the Interratioral Refugee Orgoniza-
tion. I understand fully your interest in recuring these doctments, and
while I would lik: to comply vith your requeat I do not think it will be
porsible to do so for reasons which I will set farth telow.

oe fhe quertion of documentation of individual refugees and of ac-
cess to such documents has seen a matter of canziderasle conttoversy ever
since 1985, first in UNRRA and later in the IRQ. As & result of basic dif-
ferences in political views concerning the handling of displaced persons
and refugees 1t has been necessary to safeguard ali individual dossters
with the greatest of care, These dossiers contaia not only facts about the
individus! refugee and hie immediate family, wut aleo about his relstives,
many of vhon are not displaced persons and sre ctill in their countries of
origin, As a matter of fect, the Organization bed a great deal of diffi-
culty {no eecuring the cooperation of individual éirplaced versors ia coa-
pleting ou: Registration Forns, because of the fear thet there refugees hed
that such data aight fall into the hands of individuals, institutions or
goverments which might take punitive action ageicet relotives of displaced
persons refusing to return to ry country of origts.’ The TRO assured all
displeced persons that thelr personal records axi docunents woul’ te safe-
guarded to as crest an extent as posaible and would be made available to
governments only for the purpose of directly assieting in securing the re-
settlement atroad of the i:dividual concerned, We nave attempted in every
way to follow this policy consistently.

As ve approach the end of IRO operations, ve are making place for
@ Aisposal of the irdividual case records either by giving thes to govern~

pents in the countries of reception, or ~y dectriction of the recor’s. or
vhere the refugees are still in Germany or Austria, by turcing the docusents
over to the United Rations ich Commissioner for Refugees. I regret there-
fore thet iu view of the security factors involved, it vill not be possible
to asree to your proposal thet certain oy these individual records te mde
avails>le to you for purpores of nistorical research. :

I wight edd, if you will permit an exprersion of opision on the
subject, that’urlese you vere to secure a complete cet of records, it is
most unlikely that the type c? sampling suggested in your letter vould

Despite the apparent Impenetra-

into free territory at ‘a rate of 500
to 1500 a week,

They bring with them not only
Vital Intelligence of what joes on in
the Red-dominated sectors.of Europe,
but in many cases real talents and
abilities which can be used to help our
cause. They also bring hope. They
are living reminders that ordinary,
decent people.are not easily sold ‘on
the fraud of Marxism, Russian-style,
and that democracy still attracts free-
minded men if they have any kind of
a choice,

Unfortunately, these Iron curtain
refugees are not getting a very warm
reception on our side now: They land
with a horde of other displaced per-
‘sons, but they are not technically qua-
ified to tecelve D.P. ald. Neither is | f

And unless some-.answer to their

Its to be hoped that some official
program will eventually be evolved to
ald them In finding @ permanent new
place, Their talents, like those of the
other D.P.'s, can certainly be used in

ig such arrangements, Tow.

Vever, it is vital that their minimum rev

quirements be met through private
charity. General Carl Spaatz has just

«he accepted the chairmanship because fe. viewed

is to bring emergency aid to the many thousands
fof human beings who are-risking their lives to
escape Soviet terror and brutality, he added this
significant facts”: f
NtAmong them’ are people who have been
‘and can be of thé greatest assistance to us in
providing Us with an understanding of the Soviet
Trentality es well as with vital intelligence: on
‘what is happening behind the fron Curtain.””
Gen. Spaatz cited the cases of three eminent
‘Russian scientists who had been assisted by
the International Reseue Commitee after their
‘escape. One, be said, was among “the foremost
s Russian nuclear physicists visder- whose direc-
tog a vital progeam of nuclear research. was
carried out at a major Russian university.” Ane
‘other, he said, was “engaged. in important geo~
Jogical surveys in the Tashkent-area of the
USSR, now believed to be a proving ground for
Soviet atomic experiments.” The third, accord-
ing to the general, was a ‘‘very prominent geolo-

gist” who had surveyed Arctic areas of the
UsSR “now reported to be the sites of secret
air bases.” 7

Lest anyone be fearful that the Soviets are de~
tiberately, planning the escape of enemy agents
under the guise'of refugees, Gea. Spaatz said
thot, with the screening given by the govert-
ment, there was-slight chance that enemy agents
could enter this country as, refugees. ‘The .or-
ganization gives aid only to those who, in addi-
ton to’ being anti-Communist, have given indi-
cation of their Opposition to Nazism.

Hence we bave here a campaign which ought
to appeal to every American, It not only offers
help to refugees from Red oppression, a most
charitable undertaking, but it serves to increase
the security of the United States and the remain-
det of the free world.

are said to have repérted recently
that large numbers of Russion natural
scientists, technicians and intellectuals
would quit the Soviet countries und
come to live in the democracies if they
could be certain’of remunerative em-

‘These peoples, with their knowledge

But there is an organization which
is doing something about this, It is the

contributions, and ia helping reliable
refugees from Iron Curtain lands to
become established in free countries
where they may support themselves
und in the meantime contribute to-the

IRON CURTAIN REFUGEES

During the last three years some 300
000 persoas.-vietims of Russian tyranny,
have eluded the Soviet secret police ang,
escaped through the Iron Curtain. More
ave accomplishing this dangerous {éat
every day. and as most of them are with-
out means. they necd assistance to Fe
establish themselves in a free world.

This is where the Iron Curtain Refugee
Campaign of the International Rescue
‘Committee goes into action. An Ameri
can‘ enterprise, operating under the
chairmanship of General Cart Spaatz,
this organization, through its offices in
eight European countries, gives emer
Rency aid in money, food. clothing and
advice to help the refugees get a start
in new surroundings. It enables them to
avoid the bitter fate of being compelled.
by destitution to go back to their homes
Dehind the Iron Curtain, from whieh

they have endured much danger and
hardship to escape.

‘A humanitarian enterprise, the work
‘of the ICKC, a6 it becomes known to
people held: in tyranny, has a definite.
value in countering Soviet anti-Anicrican
propaganda. Among fugitives who have
been helped are men of scientific attain-
ments whe have furnished important in-
formation about developments and con-
ditions behind the Iron Curtain.

‘The campaign is financed by voluntary
contributions. The Jatest financial re+
port for the period of Jan. 1 to Sept. 30,
1950, shows income of $1,520,842 in the
fort of cash and goods in kind, such as
food. and clothing. and disbursements of

Judging from. the valuable informa-

war, and that mos the threat to our existenco ao a free people.

I regara the Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign, of which I have
agaunod the chairmanship, ao one of tho most hopoful works designed
to protect tho peace. Every Iron Curtain refugee represents a crack
in tho wall which separatos East from West, on both. sides of which
tho ovérholming majority of mon and womennant pone, During the
past three yoars, more than 300,000 men, womon and children have

A REPORT

Admiral RICHARD E. BYRD

By GENERAL CARL SPAATZ, U.S.A.F. (Ret.], Chairman, IRON CURTAIN REFUGEE CAMPAIGN

Tus ja 2 report to'the American people, Itis oleu o call to every

Atorricen w support the Iron Gurtain Refugee Campsigh of the

ause thie campaign is the

to-thoussade of starving victimes of Soviet

totslitarisniom, but also beesuse this effort is vital to the defense of the
frontiers of freedom.

Over the past three veers, more than 300,000 human beings have
eluded Soviet secret police and border guards and escaped to the West
becauae they would not live in alavery. Their numbers inerease at the
rate of 500-1000 a week. They etcape because of their opposition to Com-
munis tyranny. They escape because they are-confident that the free
ren of the West will not abandon them jin their hour of need:

That confidence has not-been in ‘vain. The Iron 'Cartain- Refagte
Campaign, since its inception last year

BERLIN (Western Sector):

In response to the Communist threat to take over Berlin
by means of a Soviet Whitsuntide youth invasion last May, the
tron Curtain Refugee Campaign launched “Project Bertin,”
Replying to a spacial appeal, individual Ameri and American
business enterprises contributed enough to permit the shipment
of almost 4,090,000 Ibs. of butter, cheese, milk and egg powder,
children's canned food, and-elothing. This aid and the continuing
sarvicas of all kinds are administered by our Berlin office in the
clesest cooperation with General Maxwell Taylor, U. $. Com
mander in Berlin, and Ernat Reuter, Mayor of Western Berlin.

far West 2s possible with a view to esteblishing a maximum dis-
tance berween themselves snd the Communist pofice apporatus.
Since there are no camps of ary kind in.the Paris area, the 60,000
refugees there ara among the most destitute in Europe. Hun-
dreds of these eseapees come te the IRC‘s Iron Curtain Refugee
Campaign office evary reception morning to ask for food parcels
or clothing or advice. On the busiest morning this year, 500 food
parcels were givan out, Very frequently escapees aro aided In
establishing themselves in smell businesses or in thair own pro
fession in France, or in. arranging for their migration to other
countries where they can make a fresh start in- life.

To assist in the work of tha Paris office, o Committee of
American ladics has been set up under the patronage of Mrs,
David Bruce, w of the Amorican Ambassador to France.
The Committee it at present endeavoring to estal a hostel
that will provide emergency shelter for new escaped: ving in
the Paris ares.

Tha International Rescue Committes also maintains offices
in STOCKHOLM, BRUSSELS, ROME AND LONDON, where the
tame humanitarian services are made available to Iron Curtain
rafugees, |

THIS VITAL WORK OF AID MUST GO ON. So long as Soviet
terror enntinues, thousands will eontinue to risk all in thelr dee
perate Might to freedom. Millions are being expended by the U. 8.
Government and individual Americans to counterset the big fle of
Soviet propagartds with the truth of freedom. But truth Is more
than words, Undernouriahment, tack of decent clothing and shelter,
the lack of concrete evidence of Western support and approval,
could make these human beings vulnerable to the continuous
stream of Soviet propaganda that political freedom in the Went
means “freedom to starve.” Prattlings about freedom mean little
to starving men, The very faet that Americane as individuals care

thon are possible. .

GERMANY: Offices in Frankfurt, Munich,
Bremen, Stuttgart.

Through these offices, thousands of recent escapees were

given emergency asslevance, Food totalling 1,500,000 Ibs. has
bean distributed to escapees in a number of refugee centers since
May, and an additional five. thousand individual food packages
weighing 75,000 Ibs, were given. out.

For the majority of these human beings the help received
through the Iron Curtain Refuges Campaign rapresented the first
tangible ald they hod secured from any prlvate source. The
amount that each individual: recaivad was necessarily limited, but
this essistaence often produced. tramendous prychological and
moral-ettect. The certainty that he is not forgotten, that some-
one in the free West carascoften saves tiese human.beings from
that soul-destroying bitterness. which-has driven some to retuen
to their ‘homes behind the iron Curtain.

In addition, fund: were also made available for rehabilitation
projects and centers of jous hinds. This included, for example,
the publication of s Hungarian history-text to: be used by the
children of Hungarian-escapees who, until. they.escaped, had been
forced to use the version current in Cominiunist Hungary. ~Alvo,
