NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 18

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 4

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Dear Ben:

I do appreciate your thoughtfulness in recommending

Ms. Dorothy W. Kuhn for consideration as a member of the

Select Committee staff.

I share your opinion that her

abilities are exceptional.

As you are doubtless aware, we still have to be funded

for the first session of the 95th Congress. Hopefully

the House will be able to accomplish this before the

end of the month.

Once that has been taken care of and

a new Chief Counsel hhs been named, we will be ready to

begin interviewing for additional staff that we may need.

I want you to be assured that Ms. Kuhn's resume will be

given every consideration at that time.

Thank youagain for your interest and for your

support.
