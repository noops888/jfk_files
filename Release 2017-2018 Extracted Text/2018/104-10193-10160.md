FIELD NQ. EGG EGG-1825

The executive committee of the Nest German National

Democratic Party (NPD) will meet on

of the Baden-Huertomberg NPD organization and attempt to

persuade the Land organization not to contest the 23 April

The exocutive committee will point out that

obtain a

majority in

the Baden-Weittemberg election will be enhanced.

This would enable the CDU to retain its Bundesrat majority

and improve the

chances of defeating the

VON THADDEN BEGINS BY TRACING THE HISTORY OF

THE UNITED STATES' RELATIOYSHIP WITH GERMAN FROM WORLD

THE 1929 STOCÄ MARKÉT CRASHI. HÈ GIVES CREDIT TO THE

UNITED STATES FOR HELPING. EUROPE BACK ON ITS

FEET AFTER

WORLD WAR LI THROUGH THE MARSHALL PLAN. BUT POINTS OUT

THAT THE NATIONS WHICH WERE HELPED USED THE AID TO BUILD

AN EXPORT BASE WIIICH NOW IS CONTRIBUTING TO AMERICA'S

FINANCIAL TROUBLES. HE SAYS THAT GERMANY AND OTHER •

COUNTRIES BECAME INFECTED WITH AN "EXPORT HYSTERIA"

AFTER THE WAR WHICH HAD SHORT TERM BENEFITS FOR WORLD

TRADE; BUT WHICH IN THE LONG RUN DAMAGED THE DOMESTIC

ECONONIES OF THE EXPORTING COUNTRIES.

3. THE 15 AUGUST 1971 SPEECHI BY PRESIDENT NIXON IS

COMPARED WITH THE 21 OCTOBER 1929 STOCK MARKET CR.ISH,

AND VON THADDEN SAYS TIAT THE SPEECH WILL HAVE JUST AS

IN HIS ANALYSIS OF THE TYPE CE WOrLD ECONONIC

SYSTEN WHICH SHOULD FOLLOW THE CURRENT AMERICAN CONTROLS

AND FLOATING OF THE DOLLAR, VON THADDEN DRAWS HEAVILY FROM

THE 23 SEPTEMBER PRESS CONFERENCE OF FRENCH PRESIDENT POMPIDOU..

HE SAYS THAT THE DOLLAR CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED THE

SINGLE WORLD CURRENCY. THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF EUROPE

MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT A EUROPEAN RESERVE CURRENCY BE

AVAILABLE AS A SECOND WORLD CURRENCY. THIS CANNOT BE

THE BRITISH POUND AS MANY PEOPLE AT ONE TIME WOULD HAVE

governments. It avolds giving an opinion on the prospects of ob

taining

court decision against the NPD, but from the content of

the study, it: 1s clear that the authors belleved that the courts

would probably reject a government proposal to bon the NPD.

(Field Comment:" If the study is atfll consideredicurrent,

it 1g

unclear how. It fits with Benda'g November 1968 statement tbat there

was sufficent evidence to obtain a ban against the NPD.)

The study summarized the case which could be brought

against the NPD as followg:

It could be shown that there was a similarity

between the NPD and the

National Socialist German Workers

Party. (NSDAP) which has been outlawed.

It could be argued that the goals, and parts of

the party platform, of the NPD are contrary to the prin

:ciples of a free democratic state.

The study concludes that a sufficlently strong case could be pre

sented to prevent the case being thrown out by the courts without

a hearing..

The study lists the following points which the NPD could

be expected to use in its defense:

The party could prove that it has given firm instruc

[tloas to its members not to engage in rowdyiam or violence.

b.

It could show that a sizeable number of former

NSDAP members have been forced out of the party as part

of the Selbstreinigung (self-cleaning) process.

which are in accord with democratic prineiples.

It could point out many features of its program

d.

It could show that its elected represcntatives

have worked with other parties and have not. disrupted the

Landtage (state diets) and other elected bodies in which

they participate.

It could point out that other political parties

have many ex-Nazis and ex-communists as members and could

claim that the majority of the 28,000 NPD members are not

The study states that it would be very difficult to re-

fute these NPD defenses in court.

The government would have

case.

Objectively, It would

have to be admitted that many

which

the

• NPD has been involved were initiated by opponents of the party.

The study predicts the following probable rcsults should

The NPD would probably respect the prohibition.

b. NPD members and sympathizers would not change their

opinions because of

Many would Join other

or parttes and continue to work for their polltical bellets.

NPD and rightist sympathizers would begin a cam-

paign for the banning of the new German Communiat Party

(DKP) and other leftist groups.

A ban of the NPD would be well received in foreign

countries.

7.

The study concludes that if the government should lose a

case against the NPD, it would be the result of the lack of valid

evidence (Bercluschwierigkelten). In such an event, the following

adverse effects would occur:

publicIty.

The NPD would receive a new impetus and valuable

The policy of Selbstreinigung which has had some

success in. keeping former Nazis out of key positions would

c.

Many middle-class persons who sympathize with the

NPD, but who have refrained from open support because of

the

stigma of being associated with a party which could be

declared illegal, would join the party or become active

supporters.

The party would undoubtedly attract more members.

(Field Comment:

The NPD leadership is known to be worried

because the party's membership has not increased sigolfi-

cantly during the past 18 months.)

Summary:

The

Berlin NPD has been plagued by n

split between the

Berlin

"City lendership, which is loyal to the Party's national leaders,

and the

"Loyalists"'

headed by

the Berlin district leaders, who opposed

von Thadden

in October 1968; Court action led to the thwarting

of the plan for dissolution.

In an effort to keep the Berlin Party

alive, in mid March von Thadden ordered a cessation of open Party ac

tivities until

after the September parliamentary elections.

Subse=

quently, von Thadden

arranged a postponement of a scheduled Berlin

Party convention

until October, because of the possibility of a ban

on the Berlin NPD by: the Allies

and the

threat of trouble

from the

militant left.

At the end of March, Berlin City NPD Chief Rudolf

Kendzia resigned

in an

effort to promote party unity in Berlin,

but

he remains active behind the scenés.

Since carly April, the Berlin

NPD leadership

has

followed von Thadden's guidelines.

The iniluence

of the Loyalists

has been greatly reduced, and in accordance with

von Thadden's

instructions party activities have been circumspect.

Both the Berlin and the National leadership are hoping that the NPD

will obtain 25 to 35 Bundestag seats in September, which, they feel,

will make the party more acceptable to right-wing voters

in Berlin

and enhance NPD chances during the 1971 Berlin communal electfons.

Berlin is planning to send volunteer workers to campaign for the NPD

in West Germany, especially in North Rhine-Westphalia, the NPD strong-

hold.

WEST GERMAS 'S.SITIONAL DEMOCRATS.AND THE GRASDCOALITION

Germar's far-right Vasional Democratic Party

(NPD) showed another increase

in

strength in recent

elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, while the Social

Democrats (SPD) lost heavily.

This outcome in a

traditionally liberal and prosperous state appears

to stem in part from the dissatisfaction of many

Socialists

and trade unionis:s

in

the SPD with

their party's cabinet cooperation with the Christian

Democrats (CDU) .

Another

factor was the discontent

of farmers. and refugees with che policies

of

the

Grand Coalition

in Bonn.

Consern over student dis

orders contributed to

the iPS gains, but this was

not

as -decisive

as

some have

supposed

Despite -

these gains, the NPD is unlitely to

achieve

growth comparable to that o: she Nazi Party in the

early 19305.

The outcome in Baden-huerttemberg confirmed

the belief of many Socialists that their coopera

tion with

the CDU at both

the national and state

level is proving to be unprofisable

for the party.

As a result,

they have

already decided at the

state

level not to renew

cabinet cosperation with the

CDU in Bader-wuerttemberg,

this making prospects

for the Bona coalition

appear less favorable.

Nevertheless, SPD leaders in Boan remain committed

to the. Grand Coalition and

serious instability at

the federal level seems unlikely.

Over the long

run the outcore

of. this

lates= election may have

certain

implications nationally, including

the

possibility

that Bonn

leaders may be encouraged

to take a more nationalist line.

Immediate Prospects

Assuming

that the Bonn co-

may

still

modify their policies

somewhat in the light of the

Baden-Wuerttemberg

experience.

The adverse vote of the refugees

as a brake on the policy of de-

Poland;

of this

Although the antistudent re-

as important a factor as some have

believed it to be, constant vio

lence and provocation on the part

of the students, accompanied by

constant press attention, could

lead to severe official or unof-

ficial counteraction.

This, in

turn, could bring more serious

student violence,

perhaps with

the support of other elements.

Some matters of student con-

cern have appeal

for others.

Thus

students and many trade unionists

THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN WEST GERMANY

The poor showing

of the ultranationalistic

disproves the

party's claim of providing

an acceptable alternative

to the policies and programs of the country's major

parties:

The NPD'g failure to. maintain the

elections last fall is directly. attributable boch

to its own well-publicized internal dissension and

The Bonn government is gen-

the NPD, believing that it would

be imprudent to drive the ultra-

rightists underground. If the

NPD were to score impressive new.

successes in future elections,

however, the resulting concern

in the major parties might prompt

& reconsideration of this policy:

Interior Minister Luecke favors

banning the party as soon as

"enough evidence can be obtained

to assure successful court action.

It is also possible that new

NPD gains would motivate the

established parties to make pro-

posed changes in the electoral

law that would make it more dif

ficult for the NPD to obtain

Bundestag representation.

Although the NPD program is

strongly reminiscent of Hitlerian

National Socialism, the party's

electoral supporters in Hesse

and Bavaria also include persons

• who have no prior Nazi aiiiiia-

tions or any particular suscepti-

bility to Nazism per se. It has

managed to attract impulsive

youngsters, as well as political

malcontents of all ages.

Its

membership includes individuals

from a broad range of occupations.

The makeup of the formal

NPD membership is not radically

different in age or occupation

However, there

are certain characteristics of

NPD supporters which set them

apart from supporters of the

left it divided and weakened by

factionalism.

This was clearly

demonstrated in March 1967 wher.

'then party chairmar. Fritz Thieien

and Deputy Chairman Adolf von

Thadden engaged in a public feud

which further damaged the party's

reputation.

An outgrowth of long-

standing personal antagonism, the

dispute was

triggered by Thielen's

resistance to Von Thadden's at=

tempted take-over as party chalr

man

Thielen

claimed that Von Thadden's elec-

tion to the state chairmanship

had been illegal and would hurt

the party's reputation.

The par-

ty's

federal executive, however,

turned the tables on Thielen and

not only voted to reinstate Von

Thadden but also to drop Thielen

from the national chairmanship and

expel him from the party. Thielen

It is possible--although in-

creasingly unlikely--that the NPD

could turn out to resemble other

parties of a national-conserva-

•tive stamp.. Despito the radical

views of some of thair mémbers;

such groups

have.managed. to.op-

The 'German Party (DP),

for

example, which had

been rep-

resented

in

several North German

state legislatures and in the

conducted itself. in a

responsible fashion.

The NPD at present draws a

good deal of this traditional

right-wing vote from the old Refu

gee Party, the De, and small con-

servatIve

regional parties such

as the Bavarian Party.

The total

extremist vote, however, has in

creased very little since the

establishment of the NPD.

ES-

timates of the extont of hard-core

ultranationalist sentiment in

Germany vary between 5 and 15 per-

cent of the electornte.

Under

present conditions this does not

constitute a threat to German dem

ocratic institutions and is not

greater than the degree of ex-

tremist sentiment in other West

Outlook

Assuming the NPD survives

the current poriod of internal..

strife,

its potential for further

growth beyond its present 6- to

8-percent

limited under

conditions now pre-

vailing in West Germany.

The NPD

is still capable of capitalizing

on circumstances which might pre-

protracted

economic recession or

would discredit the present gov-
