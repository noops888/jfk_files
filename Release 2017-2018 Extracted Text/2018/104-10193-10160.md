‘erywhere there is curiosity about thos mysteri-
ous 12 years. The teachers who taught then are still
teaching, unless stperannuated, but very few of them
dare to teach what they used to teach, of even to talk
about “the past.” That is why Dus dritte Rewh was
founded this year: to make money outof that curiosity.
The idea was that ot Hans-Peter Dietze, now its man-
aging, editor, according to his editor-in-chief, Dz.
Christian Zentner, who stakes a pious claim to a de-
sue tu-show his young compatriots how the Third
Reich came to pass, in ordet ty prevent its ever hap-
pening again, After four issues, Dr. Zentner is not 50
sure that hus publisher, the big Hamburg house of
John fahe Verlag KG, will do much more than break
even, because, he told me, what millions of people are
insatably interested in is not “the abstractions” of
nazism and its history but its personalities, and in
particular Adolf Hitler. These, he says, are “simple”
people who do-not read books but who wateh televi-
sion and read magazines, and it was they whom he set
out to capture ~to clarify the past for them.

His magazine is expensive - about $1.50 a copy. A
treniendous advertising campaign, of dubious taste,
resulted in first-issue sales some 150,000 above the
350,009 copies that the editors and publis!
pected, The second issue sold between 33000 and
3H0.000 copies, the third something over 250,090 so
far, and the fourth ~ which 1s still on the newsstands —

_ More than 200,000, The overwhelming majority of the
purchasers and subscribers, Zentner admits, seems to
include few of those young people he was lovking tur
the real circulation 18 among the péople old enough to
remember, the Nazis who wait furious letters to the
editor b-cause he tarnishes their legends, Beth Dietze
and Zentner fold me that the greatest sales of Das
dritte Reich are not in cities but out in the country and
the small towns, in Bavaria and Franconia especially.

One of the reasons for the phenomenal success of a
television program called “Ein Herz und eie Sele”
(One Heart and One Sout”) is its enthusiastically en-

1, Adolf von Th adden. NPD chairman, remains firmly ‘in

control of the party following the 14-15 Februsry 1970 NPD congress
in Werthein,

2, Skepticism about. the future of the NPD is increasing among
party leaders, The NPD is definitely planning to wage vigorous cam-
paigns in all 1970 Land elections, but there appears to be little
chance that the party will do even as well in these elections ag it

3. At. the congress, several erominent NPD leaders emphasized
the-need for party unity; these apreals were well received-by the®
delegates, There are many unresolved questions and problems, how=
ever, which will continue to plag:e the party. For instance, thq
"national-conservative" concept, rich was adopted in the manifesto
issued by the congress, came under strong attack, One group, which. _
includes both older and younger members, rejects the coacept of the

NPD as 9 Conservative party, because they consider. that this term

conveys the idea that the party is an out-of-date and reactionary
political group, On the-other h the proponents of the national-
conservative concept consider thenselves as upholding “positive
values" invthe face of manifestatzcas of disintegration. Von Thadden
is the party's unifying force, and one delegate accurately summarized
the situation by saying: "Von Thacden, by virtue of the charisma of «

his speeches, succeeded in bridging the many cracks in the party." 3

Summary? In June 1968, the West Germin Ministry of the Interior
prepared a basic study of the.prospects’of banning the West German
National. Democratic Party (NPD). The summary of this study given
below describes the major charges which the government could. bring
against the NPD, the defenses the NPD could be expected to make
against these charges, and the probable political results which
would follow both a successful and an unsuccessful case against the
NPD. According to the source, this study is still considered the.
basic Interior Ministry evaluation of the case against the NPD and
1s being studied by senior federal yovernment and state (Land)

officials, End of Summary,

1. (Field Comme For several years, West German political
der:

and government le have debated seeking a constitutional court
ban on the NPD. On 13 November 1968, Ernst Benda, West German
Interior Minister, advised Chancellor Kurt Georg Kicsinger
that there was sufficient evidence to-warrant bringing a suit against
the NPD, Kiesinger, however, opposed bringing a suit, “and the sub=
ject became embroiled in West German politics. Cn 23 April 1969,
the Federal Cabinet decided not to scék 4 court ban of the NPD, at

cd least until ofter the September elections, This decision. was
prompted by evidence that the NPD was making no membership gains
and apparently was losing populor support.)

3. The study summarized the cage which could be brought
against the NPD as follows:
a. It could be shown that there was 4 atm larity

between the NPD and the National Socialist German Workers
Party, (NSDAP) which has been outlawed. ‘

_ DB, It,could be argued that the goals, and parts of
_-the party platform, of the NPD are contrary to the prin-
‘ciples of a free democratic state. :

The study concludes that-a sufficiently strong case could be pre-
sented to prevent the case being thrown out by the courts without
a hearing.

' 4. The study lists the following points which the NPD cculd
be expected to use in its defense:

a. The party could prove’ that it has given firm inetruc=
(tioas to its members not to engage in rowdyism or violenca, 5

b. It could show that a sizeable number of former
NSDAP tembers have been forced out of the party as part
of the Selbstreinigung (self-cleaning) process.

c. It could point out many features of its program
which are in. accord with democratic principles.

' d, It could show that its elected representatives
have worked with other parties and have not. disrupted the
Landtage (state diets) and other elected bodies in which
they participate.

It could point out that other political parties
have many ¢x-Nazis and ex-communists as members and could
claim that the majority of the 28,000 NPD members are not
opposed to the concept of the Federal Republic,

f. It would charge that the government's charges were
! one-sided, unfairly presented, and out of date,

; g- It would claim that not all of Professor Ernst

: Anrich's points were included in the party plat-

fae form, “(Field Comment: Anrich is a former university ©

extreme ‘than those incorporated in the ‘party platform.)

d. A ban of the NPD would be well received in foreign

7. The study concludes that 1f the government should lose a
case against the NPD, it would be the result of the lack of valid
evidence (Beweisschwierigkeiten). In ‘such an event, the following
adverse effects would occur: :

a, The NPD would receive a new impetus and valuable
publicity.

b. The policy of Selbstreinigung which has had some
success in. keeping former Nazis out of key positions would
be halted...

¢. Many middle-class persons who sympathize with the
NPD, but who have refrained from open support because of

the stigma of being associated with o party which could be
declared illegal, ‘would join the party or become active

supporters.

d. The party would undoubtedly attract more members,

cantly during the past 18 months.)

1, According to a ranking official of the Kiel district
of the National Democratic Party (NPD), Karl-Heinz
Knipphals, the chairman of the Kiel district of the
NPD, and Adolf von Thadden, the national chairman
of the NPD, are personal enemies. {Source Comment: In
January 1969 Knipphals was elected to be his party district's
candidate for the West Gorman Parliament. Knipphals, a Kiel
lawyer, is in his carly 50's, He was severely wounded during
World War IT and has only, one arm.)

2. Von Thadden is aware of, and unhappy about, the fact
that Knipphals, prior to joining the NPD, participated in
Easter Marches and received unfavorable publicity, Further=
more, voix Thadden is. concerned about Knipphals' strong and
ruthless political ambitions, Ne has referred to Knipphals
as a “second Hitler", and he welcomes and encourages the fact
that there is strong opposition to Knipphals even within the -
Kiel district of the party. Von Thadden, for the above
reasons, would very much like to see Xnipphals remain on the

“ district lével and is anxtous to keep him out of the West
German Parliament,

3. The same official. who made the remarks about von
Thadden and Knipphals. also stated that many wealthy industrial-~
ists contribute funds to the NPD an nynously, because they do
not wish their association or sympathy with the party to
become known,

1, A 77-page German-language report, describing the
National Democratic Party (NPD) and presenting documentary
and testimonial evidence of possibly unconstitutional aspects
of the NPD, has been deposited in the files of the CIA Docu-
ment and Pictorial Services Division, from which copies may
be obtained upon.request.. The report is the shorter of two
versions prepared by the Federal Office for the Protection of
the Constitution (Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz). This
shorter version is said to be complete in substance and is
the version which was made available to West German Cabinet
members in preparation for Cabinet discussion of whether the
NPD should be.banned. The longer, two-volume version has not

been obtained,

2. Appraisal of the legal validity of the evidence
against the NPD was omitted from the report at the order
of the Minister of the Interior, who reserved to himseif an.-
assessment of the NPD's “legality. Also, pages 9 to 13--a
section entitled Chief Features of the Ideology (Grundzuege
der Ideologie)--was omitted from the report at the request
of the Minister of the Interior, (Headquarters Comment:
The evidence in the report appears to be overt and less than
conclusive. The West German Cabinet decided in the spring

* of 1969 not to request a ban of the NPD; substantial doubt

existed as to whether there were sufficient grounds to obtain
a legal ban of the NPD. The omissions from the text, referred

‘to in this paragraph,. may reflect realization by the Interior

Ministry of the weakness of the case against the NPD.)

Summary: The Berlin NPD has been plagued by a split between the
Berlin City leadership, which is loyal to the Party's national leaders,
and the "Loyalists" headed by the Berlin district leaders, who opposed
the dissolution of the Berlin NPD. ordered by National Party Chairman
Adolf von Thadden in October 1968; . Court action led to the thwarting
of the plan for dissolution, In an effort to keep the Berlin Party
alive, in mid-March von Thadden ordered a cessation of open Party’ ac-
tivities until after the September parliamentary elections, Subse-
quently, von Thadden arranged a. postponement of a scheduled Berlin
Party convention until October, because of the possibility of a ban
on the Berlin NPD by. the “Allies and the threat of trouble from the
militant left. At the end of March, Berlin City NPD Chief Rudolf
Kendzia resigned in an effort to"promote party unity in Berlin, but

he reiains active.behind the scenes. Since carly April, the Berlin
NPD leadership has followed von Thadden's ‘guidelines, The influence
of the Loyalists has been greatly reduced, and in accordance with

von Thadden's instructions party activities have been circumspect.
Both the Berlin and the National leadership are hoping that the NPD
will obtain 25 to 35 Bundestag seats in September, which, they feel,
will make the party more acceptable to right-wing voters in Berlin
and enhance NPD chances during .the 1971 Berlin communal elect fons.
Berlin is planning to send volunteer workers to campaign for the NPD
in West Germany, especially in North. Rhine-Westphalia, the NPD strong-

hold. ‘End of Summary. 4 =

: 2. Following the abortive attempt dy the National Democratic
‘ Party (NPD) leadership to force the Berlin NPD to dissolve itself for
: tactical reasons in October 1968, routine party, activity resdmed al-
most {mmediately, Lt was characterized by a split between the leader~
ship.of ‘the Berlin City (Landésverband) party unit and that of “dis-
trict (Kreisvertand) party units, The former are generatly loyal to
National TY Par ty°Chairman Adolf von Thadden and the national leadership
in Hanover and their broader tactical concepts; while the, latter, re=
ferred to as the “Loyalists” (Sdtzungstréuc) defend the Iétver of thé
rlin NPD'statutes, The Loyalists initially objected primarily to
the mechod of the attempted dissolution, but the friction with the
Gity Executive Committee (Landesvorstand) headed by Rudolf Kendzia
led to: total. mutual-mistrust, disloyal statements to the press, ‘and
efforts to get. each. other: expelled from the party by a party court

(Schiedsgerieht), 5 4

vo 3, At a. geneval membership aect ing in Borlin-qnz}s.. Narch.1969,
‘von Thaddén attempted to.achieve a truce within the party and ordered
‘cUethat- there be ‘no “political. organizational activity” until after the
: s$eptember 1969 parliamentary elections, At this meeting von Thadden
He approved the scheduling. of a Berlin party convention (Landesparteitag)
*-for 26"April 1969, at which a new and hopefully more stable city
Executive Committee was to be elected, ‘

4. The 15 March meeting provided an indication that the Berlin
NPD may well stick together under. von Thadden's guidance until 1971,
in spite of the friction between city and district leadership, Al-"
though the eight ‘spokesmen for the local leadership, who took the
floor after Kéendzia's situation report and von Thadden's icynote
speech, approved the action of the Berlin NPD districts in opposing
the seif-dissolution of the local party, and no one contradicted them,
' all but 3l-of the 140 members present then voted for a-resolution con-
: demning District Chiefs Johann Ratzek (Schceneberg) and Philipp
Goelles (Wilmersdorf), leaders of the Loyalists, for anti-party ac-
tivity. This vote amounted to a vote of confidence in the tactics of
the Berlin:City leadership, and according to members present was due
solely to von Thadden's presence and influence. In the’ view of these
. members, a meeting without the attendance of representatives of the
7 Hanover headquarters would have led.to a no-confidence vote in the
‘Kendzia leadership, During the meeting, von Thadden also rejected
Kendzia's "Berlin Program," which called for a softer line on East

Germany and on German reunification.

5.. At the 15 March session, left-wing, anti-NPD protestors
assaulted a number of NPD members and forced the NPD twice to change
its meeting site, This leftist action and the obvious fact that the
militant left has a penetration of the Berlin NPD have had a seri-
ously dampeniag effect on the NPD's willingness to meet in the open,
The party is now tentatively planning to hold future meetings on a
rented excursion boat whose location would not be announced until the

time of the meeting.

uy 6, The Berlin NPD has made strenuous efforts to determine which
left-wing organizations made up the task force which tried to disrupt
the 15 March meeting. The Extraparliamentary Opposition (APO) claimed
the honor, but the NPD investigation showed definitely that all but a
handful of the protestors were an organized group dispatched by the
Spandau branch of the West Berlin Socialist Unity. Party (SEW) whose
actions_are part of a long-range program of harassment by the East

Berlin Socialist Unity Party (SED).

7, -Because of the subsequent possible threats of prohibition
by the Allies (signalled by a letter from Governing Mayor Klaus
Schuetz to the Allies asking that’ the NPD in Berlin be banned) and of
further counter-demonstrations by the militant left, on 27 March
von Thadden wrote a letter to the Berlin.City leadership asking that

9. On Kendzia's resignation, Guenther Mensel, a member of the
Executive Cominittee, was selected as, Acting Pz. ty Chief and Speaker
of the Party~Council until-a new Executive Committee is elected in
: October. “Mensel, an attorney, was hesitant about accepting the “joh
: because of its possible effect on his practice, and did not commit

stability were the main reasons for his selection, The only other
replacement considered was Guenter Kleinert, also on the Executive
Committee, whom Kendzia did not trust, Mensel's duties are to con-
sist of calling and chairing pro-forma monthly Executive Committee
meetings and.of presiding at the party congress next October,

: 10.” Kendzia considers his resignation a temporary tactical re~

: treat caused by disagreements with the NPD national and Berlin dis-

trict leaders, by von Thadden's public rejection of his “Berlin

Program," loss of businéss becausé of unfavorable publicity, and a

hit-and-run car accident involving a bicyclist on 27 March, Kendzia

promised Mensel to remain active behind the scenes and set up a

: _vacant office in his place of business as party headquarters, with

t desks for himself and Executive Committee members Frank Schwerdt,
Joachim Rebuschat and Hans Werner Andreas, the de facto heads of the

Berlin NPD,

11, Kendzia and a majority of the NPD leaders hope that the fall
elections will bring some 25 to 35 NPD members into tne Bundestag,
This, they feel, will make the party more acceptable to potential
right-wing voters in Berlin and thus enable the NPD to make a showing
in che 1971 Berlin communal elections, (Source Comment: The Berlin
NPD!'s major problem in Berlin is to keep ifs membership intact and
: its machinery functioning until 1971, -Whether Kendzia will hold to
: his promise to direct the Berlin NPD from behind the scenes indefi-

nitely, and whether he will emerge as leader ‘in 1971, are open ques-
* tions, because Kendzia has shown an interest in the current program
and“policies of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and particularly in
its "General-Contract" concept, which fits in with his "Berlin
Program." A close friend of Kendzia's, (fnu) Nerchert, resigned from
the NPD. to protest..its participation in the presidential election in
Berlin on S March and has already made overtures to the FDP.)

12, Since Keadzia's resignation and the 10 April executive meet-
ing, the Berlin City Executive Committee (under Kendzia's behind-the-
scenes tutelage) has kept the Berlin NPD functioning and loyal to the
Hanover leadership, Executive Committee members (especially Schwerdt,
Rebuschat and Andreas).have attended annual election meetings in all
12 party -districts, Through their influence, pro-von Thadden or
neutral District Executive Committees have been elected in each case.s

Germany's far-right Naticnal Democrati¢ Party
(NPD) ‘showed another increase in strength in recent

elections in Baden-Wuerttenbery, while the Social

D rats (SPD) lost heavily. This outcome in a
traditionally liberal and prosperous state appears
to stem in part from the dissatisfaction of many

‘ Socialists and trade unionists in the SPD with
their party's cabinet cooperation with the Christian
“Democrats (COU). Another factor was the discontent

- of farmers. and refugees with the policies of the
Grand Coalition in Bonn. Concern over student dis~
orders contributed to the NPD gains, but this was
not as-decisive as some have supposed. Despite -
these gains, the NPD is unlikely to achieve a
growth comparable to that @ Nazi Party in the
early 1930s,

The outcome in Baden-Wuerttemberg confirmed
the belief of many Socialists that their coopera-
tion with the COU at both the national and state
level is proving to be unproiitable for the party.
As a result, they have already decided at the state
level not to renew cabinet cocyeration with the
CbU in Baden-Wuerttemberg, ths making prospects
for the Bonn coalition appear less favorable.
Nevertheless, SPD leaders in Sonn remain committed
to the.Grand Coalition and serious instability at,
the federal level seems unlikely. Over the long

_tun the outcoce of. this lates: election may have
certain implications nationally, including the
possibility that Bonn leaders may be encouraged
to take a more nationalist 1

than in the last Baden-
enberg state election in

The NPD's Success

The West German state elec-
tions in Bacen-Wuerttesserg on
28 April brcught the far-right
National Democratic Party (NPD)
9.8 percent of the vote, the
most impressive total it has yet
attained in any state. About 71
percent of the voters turned
out, approximately three percent

in the 1965 federal election.

37.3 percent). The liberal Free
Democratic Party (FDP), made a
slight gain, winning 14.4 percent
of the vote (1964: 13,1 percent).
Against’ the background of last
October's Bremen elections, in
which the National Democratic
Party won what was then a record
percentage of 8.9, the Baden-
Wuerttemberg results brought re-
newed cries of alarm over the
dangers of neo-Nazism in the Fed-
eral Repubiic, More. important,
the results also raised doubts
as to the future of a coalition
government by the Christian Den-
ocrats and Social Democrats, not
only in Baden-Wuerttemberg but
at the federal government level
as well,

Baden-Wuerttemberg: A Test Case

Baden and Wuerttemberg tra-
ditionally have been strongholds
of liberal, nonsocialist democ-
racy in Germany. In the early
1930s, the Nazi vote in this
area was almost always appreci-

ably lower than elsewhere in
Germany. The hotbeds of Nazism
lay in Other regions, for ex-
ample in Franconia, East Prussia,
and. Schleswig-Holstein,

The economic and social pic
ture in Baden-Wuertteriberg would
lead to expectations of ‘stability
there. The proportion of the
population. now employed -in in-
dustry is higher than in any
other state. The economy of the
state was virtually untouched by
the recent West German recession,
during which unemployment never
exceeded one percent. Per cap-
ita income is above average.
Protestants and Catholics are
almost evenly balanced in pop-
ulation, while the proportion of
protestants in the Federal Re-
public is slightly higher,

A few observers correctly
forecast the outcome, but the
general expectation was that the
vote for the National Democratic
Party would be lower than in
Bremen, The two major West Ger-
man polling organizations had
predicted in March that the NPD
would receive five percent of the
vote.

Federal-level politicians
had campaigned actively in the
state. Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger,
a popular native son, made a
three-day speaking tour, in which
he sharply attacked “arrogant,
thoughtless, and dangerous na-
tionalism."" He stressed this
theme in the llohenlohe area,
where the NPD later received its
highest vote in the state. Willy
Brandt also appeared to speak for
the Social Democrats.

The participation by na-.
tional figures reflected a -feel-
ing in-Bonn that this state elec-
tion, the last before the 1969
federal election, might influence
national politics. Tho analogy
to the. federal scene was pointed

Wuerttemberg of a coalition of
Christian Democrats and Social
Democrats, similar to that in
Bonn.

Reaction to, Student Riots

In looking for explanations
of the NPD gains, German observ-
ers have emphasized the public
reaction against the Easter stu-
dent rioting, and dissatisfaction
with the federal grand coalition.
Conservatives. lean to the former
explanation, while students and
trade“unionists stress the latter.
The NPD did not receive less thai,
6 percant in any electoral dis-
trict. This suggests that the
sentiment expressed by the vote
is widespread, and may extend
throughout the FRG.

Reaction to student rioting
probably contributed something,
but this aspect seems to have
been exaggerated as a factor in
NPD gains. In Heidelberg, the
NPD vote rose to 11,9 percent,
but in three other university
towns, the party's vote fell
below the state average of 9.8
percent. In industrial Esslingen,
where there had been two stu-
dent riots, the NPD only attained
9 percent. Some voters may have |
been influenced by student denm-
enstrations to transfer their
votes from the SPD to the CDU,
whose spokesmen have generally ad-

vocated a stern treatment of
rioters,

At the same’ tine, ‘thé “new.
left" certainly failed to win
popular support, The Democratic
Left, supported by radical stu-
dents, won only 2.3 percent in
the state as a wholé, while mak-
ing better showings in certain
university and industrial local-
ities.. While the Democratic
Left's state-wide average was bet~
ter than the far left had at-
tained in recent elections under
other names, it fell below the
last, low figure gained by the
Communists before they became
illegal: 3.2 percent.

Hostility to the Grand Coalition?

There is dissatisfaction
with the coalition within the-
cbU, and it can be. assumed that
some of the party's right wing
voted for the-National Democrats.
The Socialists, however, suffered
the greater loss. Left-of-center
Socialists often complain that
thé party has compromised its
principles and lost public favor.
fhere is an undercurrent of feel-
ing in these quarters that the
party has endangered German domoc-
racy .by abandoning its long-
time position of opposition and
entering into collaboration with
the CDU.

Although the SPD has pro-
vided much of the impetus to “the.
grand coalition's economic and
foreign policies, and although
the coalition in Baden-wuerttem-
berg has generally functioned
well, dissatisfaction undoubtedly
exists among idealistic members

| of the left and among tradition-

The-
connection between ‘this: left-
liberal criticism and the NPD
gains on. 28 April is not-imme-
diately apparent,

Some commentators including
‘some Socialists ;-conclude that
many “SPD voters defected to the
NPD, The respected Frankfurter
Allgemeine ‘Zeitung fudged some
f the election data to support
its argument that workers had
gone over .to the NPD, but_a more
careful analysis has shown that
the NPD did indeed win above-av-
erage support.in some working-
class neighborhoods.

Many. old Socialists and
trade unionists, such as Willi
Bleicher, the powerful boss of
the metalworkers in this state,
are cool to the coalition and
hostile to intellectuals, and
some of them are repelled by an--
archic student leftism. Even so,
nos€ workers -are unlikely under
conditions of full employment to
cast what they would consider a
neo-Nazi vote; certainly Bleicher
would never favor such ‘action.
SPD electoral losses would seem
to be due less to defection to
the NPD than to the failure of
lower-level SPD functionaries,
apathetic, or evenhostile toward
the coalition, to get out’ the
vote, and to the failure of many
trade union and normally SPD
voters to go to the polls.

In traditionally ‘socialist
Mannheim, only 58 percent of
those entitled to vote turned out,
SPD percentages dropped 14 per-
cent in one district and 13 per-

‘-eént in another. ‘The percentage

| of NPD. strength rose to 12.1,
10.9, and 11.2/in the three city”
districts, but working cla
votes would not be needed to pro-
vide these percentages, espe-

cially in the face of-a ‘low SPD
tifinout. These votes probably 3 q
came mainly from the CDU, the

FOP, of from those who had not

voted before.

NPD Activity Pays Off

The NPD organization worked
hard during the campaign, con-
ducting more meetings than all
the other parties put together.
The party has overcome its former
inexperience and disunity,, and
is developing into a well-oiled
political machine. The organ-
ization fields speakers and pro-
vides canned speeches and prop-
aganda materials to local groups.
The NPD's heritage is not purely
Nazi, It encompasses more re-
spectable antecedents, such as
the Deutschnationaler (German
Nationalists) and other conser-
vative elements. In the inter-
ests of avoiding a government
ban, the National Democratic
Party shuns blatantly Nazi
appeals and tactics.

Adolf von Thadden, the na~
tional leader of the NPD, is a
smooth personality from a Junker
family who denies charges that
he was an active Nazi. He seems
to model himself more on De
Gaulle than on Hitler. ‘The
Baden-Wuerttemberg leader of the
party, Wilhelm Gutmann, is a
former Nazi. During “the good ‘
| old days," he was Buergermeister

sijice ‘the fair population in the
Federal Republic has dropped in

portant voting factor in this
northern area is the relatively
high proportion of refugees, who
were probably aroused by recent
statements by Willy Brandt about
the Oder-Neisse line and by ‘the
failure of the COU to- react more
forcefully against Brandt.

As was the case in the
early 1930s, overwhelmingly
Catholic areas, where the Church
influences its members politi-
cally, had the lowest right ex-
tremist vote. One overwhelm-

FDP Gains and Losses

The FOP profited from its
position in the opposition. Ralf
Dahrendorf, a scciologist from
the University of. Konstanz with
an international reputation, has
recently entered the party and

has assumed a leading role, in-

‘huencing the FOP in a loftward
direction and attracting left~
liberal support. In the Stuttgart
district where he was a candidate,
the party vote rose by 6 percent.
On the other hand, the new pat~
tern is not acceptable to many
old members of this tradition~
ally business-oriented party, who
looking askance at Dahrendort's
readiness to debate and discuss
with Rudi Dutschke and other rad-
ical students. ‘Two of the three
districts with heaviest NPD gains
also showed heavy FDP losses, as
did some other former FDP areas
of strength.

Perspectives on the Vote

The over-all picture appears
to be that while both the Chris-
tian Democrats and the Free Demo-
crats lost to the NPD, they gained
at the expense of the Socialists.
The Socialists suffered from
apathy and incurred some loss to
both the NPD and Democratic Left.

hardly likely that the congress

not seem to be under serious con~
sideration at the moment. It
would violate German tradition,

Althoiigh. the growth of
the NPD is disturbing, alarm does
.,Not seem to be warranted, In the
early 1930s, Germany suffered
from depression and high uncm-
ployment, and had bitter memoriés
of a recent inflation which wiped
out savings. Powerful elements

1969 federal elections may help
to prevent a real bancvagon de-  -

Tt must be eiphasized
that the NPD is still a small
party, if no longer a mere splin-
ter group.

The Coalition Problem

German observers tend to be
more worried’ about the effect of
the NPD showing on foreign opin-
ion than about the increase in
NPD strength itself, and their
greatest concern is over the pros-
pects for the grand coalition,
résulting from the SPD losses.

A Baden-Wuerttemberg SPD conven-
tion voted on 18 May against con-
tinuing the coalition in stuttgart,
and the old state SPD leaders
resigned. This would seem to

make the prospects for the Bonn
coalition less favorable.

At the same time, the FDP
appears not to be in a mood to
return to a coalition in either
Bonn or Stuttgart. Dahrendorf
has suggested that there might be
a CbU minority government in the
state. State CDU leaders may,
however, prefer to call new elec-
tions if a coalition cannot be
formed. In this event, they
would appeal for an absolute ma~
jority from the voters. If they
got it and if the NPD vote de-
clined, this would be encouraging,
but new elections might also have
a less favorable outcone.

tion, which itis far from ready
to do.

A collapse of the grand
coalition in Bonn either before
or after 1969 and a return by
the SPD to opposition positions
would signify more than a passing
cabinet crisis. In the past,
parties ‘tended to harden into
intransigence, committed to par-
ticular ideological and material
interests, and unable to reach
pragmatic compromises with each
other. In recent years, West
German politicidns have tried to
break with this tradition and
to work oa the consensus prin-
ciple. A failure of these ef:
forts would have serious imp]
cations. If--as does not “seen
- likely at present--the three
major parties were unable to
form a majority government, this
might lead to severe instability
and the discrediting of par-
liamencary government.

Bonn_and Weimar

Many misleading analogies
have been drawn .between the Bonn

and Weimar republics. One Weimar

precedent may help, however, to

969 federal election:

explain why some observers view -
the coalition problem seriously.
In March 1930, another grand
coalition with SPD participation
collapsed ovar the question of —
cuts in unemployment insurance,
leading to ‘the formation of a
conservative majority government
under Heinrich Bruening.. Bruening
was later replaced by the reac-°
tionary Franz von Papen, who in
turn was followed first by a wire-.
pulling general, Kurt von Schlei~
cher, and ‘then by Adolf Hitler.
The worst aspect of the SPD with-
drawal was that it made the par~
liament ineffective and power-
less.

Once minority government was
embarked on, supported by presi-
dential prérogatives, there was
no effective test for legitimacy
except the will of Hindenburg by
then susceptible and old. The
Nazis ultimately came to power,
not by a majority vote, but through
the paralysis and impotence of the
constitutional system and through
intrigues in the presidential
palace on the part of those, espe-
cially Papen and Schleicher, who
thought they could "use" Nazi
mass support.

In contrast to the 30s,
the presidential powers now are
far weaker,* and aside from all
the other factors inhibiting a
recurrence, the Weimar precedent
itself must influence SPD leaders
in Bonn. They are completely
committed personally to the pres-~
ent coalition. A decision to
go into opposition is unlikely
under Brandt and Wehner.

“The absence of executive emergency powers is not of course without dangers. Ina bitter parliamentary deailock, an

illegal assumption of power, perhaps Ly extragovernmentil elements, mi

tbe the only way out.

Immediate Prospects

Assuming that’ the Bonn co~
alition lasts until the 1969
elections, its leading members
may still modify their policies
somewhat in the light of the
Baden-Wuerttemberg experience.

The adverse vote of the refugees
in the recent election could act
as a brake on the policy of de-
tente with Czechoslovakia and
Poland, although there is no sign
of this as yet. Chancellor Kie-
singer has attributed NPD gains
partly to "years of agitation
against our own history and against
healthy self-confidsnce," which
suggests that he may try to sound
amore nationalistic note. Toa

-strengthen the d

the extent to which.the results
continue to be attributed to
student activities, this will

nd for firm=
ness. Even before the election,
Brandt sent a telegram to SPD
state headquarters, advising that
speakers should react "completely
hard’ against student demonstra-
tions.

Although the antistudent re-
action does not seem to have been
as important a factor as some have

‘believed it to be, constant vio-

lence and provocation on the part
of the students, accompanied by
constant press attention, could
lead to severe official or unof-
ficial counteraction. This, in
turn, could bring nore serious
student violence, perhaps with
the support of other elements.

Some matters of student con-
cern have appeal for others. Thus
students and many trade unionists
Oppose emergency laws, and this
question is again being agitated.
Because of the Nazi experience,
there is widespread aversion among
left-of-center elenents to the
use of force in the name of “or-
der," however great the provoca~
tion. But also because of the
Nazi experience, a really large
increase in NPD votes does not
seem likely in the 1969 election,
or in an earlier new election in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, should that
come to pass. (CONFIDENTIAL)

“THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATEC PARTY “IN WEST GERMANY

..- The poor ‘showing of the ultranatilonalistic
National Democratic Party (NPD)! in recent electi
in several Wést German states Clearly disproves the
party's claim of providing an acceptable alternative
to the policies and programs of the country's masor
parties. The NPD's failure to, maintain the momentum
suggested by the successes scored in two state
elections last fall is directly attributable both
to its own well-publicized internal dissension and
to voter preference for the Christian Democrats and
Socialists deriving from the image of vigor and
decisiveness imparted by their “grand coalition*
under Chancellor Kiesinger. Barring some serious
reversal in the fortunes of the Kiesinger gover:
which is unlikely--it is doubtful that the NPD will
be any more successful than other fringe groups have

been in seeking to rally latent riyght-radical

ment in Germany and revive it as a dynamic political

force.

Election Setbacks

The XPD has claimed wide
attention both in Germany and
abroad and led many observers
to conclude that it was a force
to be reckoned with, ‘Within two
and a half years of its founding
in November 1964, the party
elected representatives to the
legislatures in five of West
Germany's ten states (11 counting
West Berlin). In elections this
April the party Was expected to
obtain close to 10 percent of
the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate
and 12 to 15 percent in Schleswig-
Holstein but actually won only
four seats in each parliament
with 6.9 and 5.8 percent of the
vote respectively. In the 4 June
election in the party's "home

. SECR

basé bastion” of Lower Saxony,
the NPD's performance was simi-
larly unimpressive--7 sercent

of the, vote and 10 Langtag seats..

Emphasis by party leaders
on their success in gaining rep~
resentation in all the states
where the party has cangeted
during the past year has not
masked their disappointzent that
the NPD's momentum of growth has
leveled off. The party's failure
to make a good showing in
Schleswig-Holstein and Lower
Saxony--areas considered particu-
larly susceptible to nationalist
appeals--is especially damaging,
ard raises fundamental doubt
about the party's future pros-
pects.

nationalistic: splinter groups
Which have détted the political
landscape of. postwar Germany=-the
NPD. quickly established a polit-
ical apparatus capable of func-
tioning throvghout the country.
The new party soon distinguished
itself by its relative success

in attracting the support of other
ultranationalistic-elements and a
variety of political:malcontents,
Earlier:attempts by other groups
to unite’ disparate nationdlists
invariably had foundered on -per~
sondl rivalries and tactical dis-
agreements. Some were. no more
than platforms for self-exprées=
sion by leaders advocating a
particular set of extremist no-
tions. Even the most successful,
the Socialist Reich Party (SRP),
which at its high water mark
obtained 11 percent of the vote
in the. Lower Saxcny Landtag elec-
tions in‘1951, was unable to
establish effective working rela-~
tions with rival rightist groups
before it was outlawed by the
West German supreme court in
1952. i

During its first year, the
NPD encountered many of the prob-
lems experienced by its predeces-
sors. The party was unable to put
on an effective campaign for the
September 1965 national elections
and obtained only 2 percent of
the votes--short of the 5-percent
minimum required for representa~
tion in the Bundestag. In local

Page 3

elections in’Bavaria and Schleswig=
Holstein in March 1966, however, |
the .NPD showed that it could com-
mand pockets of strength. In the
Bavarian cities of Nuremberg and
Bayreuth, it received between 7
and 10 percent of the vote and.
elected representatives to the lo-
cal governing councils, These
gains were facilitated by concen-
trating the party's efforts in
selected’ areas such as the Protes-
tant centers of Middle and Upper

“Franconia in heavily Catholic

Bavaria.

The first clear demonstra-
tion that the NPD could attract
wore than the ultranationalist
vote came two weeks later in ~
Hariburg, where the party nearly
doubled its vote as compared with
the Bundestag election the year
before. Although the NPD failed
to elect any deputies, the Chris-
tian Democrats and the Socialists
were concerned about its ability
to secure even 3.9 percent of
the vote. The threat to the tra~
ditional third party, the conserva-
tive Free Democrats (FDP) became ,
apparent. The FDP fell a third
below its 1965 vote and lost 4 of
its 12 seats in the Hamburg city
council. Profiting from a decline
in the economy which was already
under way and the increasing pub-
lic disenchantment with the lead-
ership of then Chancellor Erhard
in Bonn, the NPD accelerated both
its organizational effort and its
public relations campaign,

The stage was then set for

its history: - By uaderlining the
weakness of ‘the FOP, the election
outcome contributed to the forma-
tion of the grand cvalition gov-
ernment in Bonn by the Christian
Democrats and the Socialists.

For the major parties, the
NPD's successes had disturbing
implications, In contrast to its
various predecesscrs, the NPD
appeared capable of robilizing
urban as well as rural support
and of altering the general trend
long evident in most West German
elections toward a two-party
system. In Hesse, the combined
vote of the Christian Democrats
and Socialists was a lower per-
centage of the total vote than in
the pravious election four years
earlicr. Still more significantly,
however, Hesse and Bavaria ‘pro-
vided further evidence cf the
NED's ability to attract "pro-
test" votes from various dis-
affected lower-middle-class ele-
ments including small businessmen
and farmers unhappy with their
lot in. present-day Germany.

Basic Characteristics and
Sources of Strport

In spite of its direct
lineage from the old German
Reich Paity, the NPD has tried
to dispel the impression among

SRET \ :

the general public that it is the
spiritual heir of Hitler's Na- j
tional Socialists. The party has :
sought acceptance as a legitinate :
‘political party and insists. that
it intends to function within the
established democratic order.
Party spokesmen maintain that it
differs trom the established par-
ties primarily in its allegedly
superior devotion to the national
interest, which they accuse the :
governing parties in Bonn of
having failed to protect. ‘The
NPD says it offers the voter a
genuine choice between bankrupt

licies of the major parties and
a return to national morality.

As much as some NPD support
ers might wish to play down the
party's Nazi associations, how-
ever, it has been clearly estab-
lished that the leadership con-
sists of a nucleus of former
Nazis.who have been active in
neo-Nazi parties throughout the
postwar years. According to
police reports, some 2,000 of
the estimated 25,000 members cf
the NPD belonged to the Nazi party
before 1933. This ratio is roughly
eight times that for the public
as a whole, The party has lost
libel suits in which it has chal-
lenged charges of neo-Nazism.

The German Interior Ministry
notes the parallels in political
outlook and philosophy between

the NPD and the Nazis, and main-
tains that the party's activities
“approach” unconstitutionality.

In the words of one former party
member, the NPD is made up of

people "who have forgotten nothi:
and learned nothing" from Germany

1 SEGRET

The Bonn government is gen-
erally reluctant, however, to ban
the NPD, believing that it would
be imprudent .to drive the ultra-
rightists underground.....Tf the
NPD were ‘to ‘score impressive new.
successes in future elections,
‘however, the resulting concern
in the major parties might’ prompt
& reconsideration of this policy.
Interior Minister Luecke favors
banning the party as socn as
“enough evidence can be obtained
to assuré successful court action.
It is also possible that new
NPD gains would motivate the
established parties to make pro=
posed changes in the electoral
law that would make it more dif-
ficult for the NPD to obtain
Bundestag representation.

Although the NPD program is
strongly reminiscent of Hitlerian
National Socialism, the party's
electoral supporters in Hesse

and Bavaria also include persons
-who have no prior Nazi aitilia-
tions or any particular suscepti-
bility to Nazism per se. It has
managed to attract impulsive
youngsters, as well as political _
malcontents of all ages. . Its
membership includes individuals
from a broad range of occupations.
The NPD's special appeal among
the lower-middle-class, and par-
ticularly ‘among the small business-
men and farmers is reinforced by
the economic squeeze these groups
are experiencing as a result of
government economy measures. In
Hesse and Bavaria, the party did
especially well in areas noted
for traditional German nationalism

and in areas which are predomi-
nantly Protestant. Many NPD ad-

I herents are expellees from the

territories lost at. the end of
World War IT.

NPD membership is not radically
different in age or occupation.
group from a.cross section of the
general public. However, there
are certain characteristics of
NPD supporters which set them
apart from supporters of the
three major parties. The NPD
tends to attract a somewhat larger
number of older persons as well
as young adults, and the number
of lower middle class members,
including pensioners, is dis-
proportionately large. Formal
membership among students, how-
ever, is very small and only 350
of a total of 244,000 university
students are on the party rolls,

There is no evidence that
the NPD receives significant
financial support from German
industrialists. It is, however,
able to operate in the black.
The sound state of its finances
is in part a result of its prac-
tice of charging admission to its
rallies. This serves the double
function of making the rank and
file feel that they have a stake
in the party and of making it
necessary for its opponents to
pay for the right to heckle. The
¢ also derives considerable
from membership dues, sub-
scriptions to party publications,
and donations from members and
sympathizers.

: Despite NPD claims-of wide-
spread’ sympathy ‘in. the West German
varmed forces, there is no evidence
of this,” German security offi-
cials estimate that no more than

2 percent of armed forces members
are card-carrying NPD-mombers.
Since .the NPD is a-legal political
organization, military leaders

are constrained from openly in-
fluencing members of the armed
forces to oppose it. :

Many Germans are probably
reluctant openly to admit their
support for an organization like
the NPD.. It is significant, how-
ever, that only 6 percent of
respondents to a national opinion
poll in January 1967 indicated a
preference for the NPD.

Leadership Problems

The most notable single
handicap confronting the NPD is
the weakness of its leadership.
None of its leaders possesses any
great talent or stature. Cer-
tainly no individual with Hitler's
demagogic genius has yet ap-
peared, ‘The absence of strong
leadership in what has bzen called
a “fuehrer-oriented party" has
left it divided and weakened by
factionalism. This was clearly
demonstrated in March 1967 wher.
‘then party chairman Fritz Thieien
and Deputy Chairman Adolf von
Thadden engaged in a public feud
which further damaged the party's

Feputation, An outgrowth of long-
standing personal antagonism, the
dispute was triggered by Thielen's
resistance to Von Thadden's at-
tempted take-over as party chair-
mari in Lower Saxony. Thielen
claimed that Von Thadden's elec-
tion to the state chairmanship
had been illegal and would hurt
the party's reputation. The par-
ty's federal executive, however,
turned the tables on Thielen and
not only voted to reinstate Von
Thadden but also to drop Thielen
from the national chairmanship and
expel him from the party. Thielen
clung to the helm under a temporary.
court order until finally throwing
in the sponge in early May with

an announcement of his formation
of a new, rival part, the Na-
tional Peoples Party (NVP).

More of an archconservative
than a neo-Nazi, Thielen was never
more than a figurehead. Real au-
thority and leadership--as well as
ideological quidance--was provided
by Von Thadden. Von Thadden is
a 45-year-old native of Pomerania,
a member of a prominent and aris-
tocratic Prussian family, a number
of whose members were prominent
in the anti-Nazi resistance. Al~
though Von Thadden applied for
Nazi party membership he appar-
ently was never formally admitted,
an ardent nationalist, Von Thadden
aspires to become a German De
Gaulle rather than a re-creator of
the German Reich.

nence include Otto lless, party
propaganda chief, and Waldemar

Thielen's departure. clears
the way for Von ThaddeA formally
to take over leadership of the
NPD, It is doubtful that Thiclen
has the personal force or follow-
ing to organize a party with
significant strength, The impact
of the new party on the NPD will
probably be small since the bulk
of the NPD membership appears to
prefer the leadership: and ideology
of the Von Thadden' group. Cn

the other hand, the strengthening
of extremist tendencies within the
NPD signaled by the triumph of
Von Thadden may hurt the party's
interests in the long run, The
result is also likely to assist
those actively seeking a formal
government crackdown on the party.

Program

In addition to its leadership
difficulties, another failing of
the NPD is its inability as yet to
offer a clear, positive program
relevant to existing problems.
Nenophobic and opportunistic, the
NPD feeds upon nostalgia for an
older German nationalism, discon-
tent with the existing social or-
der, and Germany's international
standing and frustration over the
fact that reunification remains
as distant a prospect as ever.

Its stated objectives are ill de-
fined, when not deliberately am-
biguous, and are sometimes incon-
sistent. Its electoral approach
is generally negative and destruc-
tively critical rather than af-
firmative. Its principal targets

include ‘foreign intérests and cul~
ture which undermina old values
and “de-Germanize the fatherland."
It attacks the renunciation by
those in power of what the NPD
regards as justified German ob-
jectives. It deplores what it
considers the miseducation and
corruption of youth, “crime in the
streets," foreign aid, and the.
competition of foreign workers.

The NPD demands an end to
German dependence on the US and
calls for the revival of German
national consciousness, Tt at
tempts to draw a parallel between
West German ~ US relations and
those between the East German
regime and the USSR, In order to
free Germany from foreign domina-
tion, NPD spokesmen maintain,
American "occupation" forces must
go, although not before the with-
drawal of Russian troops, which
the NPD would have occur simultane-
ously with that of US troops.
Germany must again become master
of its éwn fate, party leaders in-
sist, and the “lie” of war guilt
and war crimes trials must be
ended and a new German general
staff created. .A key demand is
that the reunification of Germany
cannot be Limited to uniting West
and East Germany but must include
the lands heyond the Oder-Neisse
border now neld by Poland. Al-
though it docs not advocate the
use of force to achieve this ob-
jective, the party holds out hope
that recovery will be possible by
a Machiavellian deal of some scrt
NPD spokesmen at present renounce
a national nuclear capability for
Germany.

The: party ‘puts forth slogans
proclaiming "Germany for the Ger-
mans" and "Europe for the Euro-
peans." Indeed, ‘the NPD favors
a united Europe soiewhat ‘along the
lines advocated by De Gaulle.
Europe, it holds, should be’ com=
pletely independent of the US,
and possess its own nuclear deter-
rent. It should be built on a
Franco-German alliance that smaller
European countries sooner or later
would have to join. The NPO would
welcome the decay of NATO as sig-
naling the end of sterile policies
which do not serve Germany's real
interests.

In secking to gain the broad-
est popular acceptance, the party
avoids affirming the more extreme
aspects of Nazi ideology. There
is, for example, no obvious anti-
Semitism in the party program
and Jews technically could become
party members, ‘The private atti-
tudes of the leadership, however,
are said to resemble traditional
Nazi anti-Semitism closely. The
NPD makes vague references, more-
over, to the importance of "blood
ties," rejects evidence relating
to the Nazi extermination policy,
makes derogatory references to
the Jews in the party press, and
denounces aid to Israel.

In recent campaigning in
Lower Saxony, NPD spokesmen
shifted tactics somewhat by no
longer stressing issues obviously
associated with the Nazi period
such as war guilt and reparations.~
Instead, they sought to exploit
current grievances including
the economic recession, unemploy-
ment, lack of progress on reuni-

fication, dnd. what they called
the unreliability of NATO.

Future Prospects

The NPD's failure to main-
tain the momentum of last fall's
successes in this year's state
elections in Schleswig-Hlolstein,
Rhineland-Palatinate, and Lower
Saxony is a serious blow to the
party's hopes. The squabble
among the leadership apparently
reincorced the feeling among un-
committed elements that casting
a protest vote for the NPD was
not worthwhile under present cir-
cumstances. The widespread dis~
content among farmers over gov~-
ernment economy measures did not
result in a significant shift of
votes to the NPD. Moreover,
there has been a strony resur-
gence of general ‘confidence in
the Ronn government. Although
the NPD benefited last fall from
the popular dissatisfaction with
the Erhard government, the grand
coalition headed by CDU Chancellor
Kiesinger has displayed vigor and
decisiveness which has been re-
warded at the polls.

Even if the NPD were to fol-
low its forerunners into oblivion
it would not mark the end of right-
ist extremism, A portion of the
German electorate will remain re-
ceptive to this kind of appeal.

In the absence of, a party such as
the NPD, right-wing voters tend

to give their support to one of
the insignificant splinter par-
ties, or to one of the more con-
servative established parties,

such as the FDP, when they vote

at all,

It is possible--although in-
creasingly-unlikely--that. the NPD
could turn out ‘€o..resemble other
parties of a national-conserva-
tive stamp.. Despite the radical
views of some of thoir members,
such groups have managed.
erate without. subversive
festations. ‘The ‘German Pacty (OP),
for example, which Nad been rep-
resented in several North German
‘state legislatures and in the
Bundestag conducted itself in a
responsible fashion. .

The NPD at present draws a
good deal of this traditional
right-wing vote from the old Refu-
gee Party, the DP, and small con-
servative regional parties such
as the Bavarian Party. The total
extremist vote, ‘however, has in-
creased very little since the
establishment of the NPD, Es-
timates of the extent ‘of hard-core
ultranationalist sentiment in
Germany vary between 5 and 15 per-
cent of the electorate. Under
present conditions this does not
constitute a threat to German dem-
ocratic institutions and is not

greater than the degree of ex-
tremist sentiment in-other West-
ern. Europedn countries.

Qutlook

Assuming the NPD’ survives
the current period of internal
strife, its potential for further
growth beyond its present 6- to
ercent range appears to be
iinieed under conditions now -pre-
vailing in West Germany. The NPD
is still capable of éapitalizing
on circumstances which might pre-
sent themselves as a result of a
protracted economic recession or
major political blunders which
would discredit the present gov-
ernment leadership. The outcome
of recent state elections, how-
ever, tends to confirm that the
overwhelming majority of German
voters continues to prefer the
moderate, -albett~increasingly
independent and nationalist, pol-
icies of the major parties and
the government, and rejects the
radical alternatives advocated
by the NPD. (SECRET)

(Summary: The West German Federal Office for the Protection
of the Constitution (BfV) and its regional affiliates

(L£V) have undertaken a program to monitor and counter

the activities of the National Democratic Party (NPD).

“+ Included in this program are efforts to penetrate the NPD

at all its levels, to monitor its membership end finances,
and to counter its influence.

Reports For a number of ‘years the BfV has been engaged in
penetrating and monitoring the activities of right radical

organizations. Since the establishment of the NPD 4n, - -75 AYO,
|

1964,the BfV has made a concerted effort to penetrate it
at both the national and regional levels. This effort has
resulted in the recruitment of about 60 sources with access
to the NPD organizations at_oll levels. In several cases

the BfV or LfV have been able to recruit local NPD county
chairmen and in six Lacnder have access to the minutes and
files of the Land organizatlons. The BfV has also penetrated
tho. national headquarters of the NPD in Hannover.”

3. Through its penetration of the national organization, the
BEV has been able to olitain and photograph the entire mem=
bership roils, which currently contain about 20,000 names.
The national Mst has been augmented by additional member—
ship applications obtained via ponotrations of the 2. i
Land organizations. The BfV is currently in the process

5
4 of tracing all of these’ membership applications against
7 the master Nazi Party membership files at the American

controlled Berlin Pocumont Genter, Although this tracing
Activity ian.not bien completed and-is bandicapped by lack
of personnel at the Berlin Document Cenicr, the B£V estinetes
its current file on the NPD is far more accurate than the
files at the NPD headquarters. Because of its access to

the Berlin Document; Center,. ‘the BfV will. eventually. hava

a better estimate of the number of NPD members who are
former Nazi Party members than does. tho NPD. itself.

The BfV is also making a concerted effort to obtain docu-.

. mentary, evidence on tie NPD's Sourcés of income. The recruite
ment 6fforts to do this are directed at spotting and recruite
ing. clerical help who ‘workin NPD officés andhave access

to filés. ‘Information in‘the ‘BfV's possession to date,

which. includes considerable’ documentary. evidence regarding
finanées, indicates that the party is not’ receiving any
substantial’ financial.sssistance from abroad, The principal
sources of funds are a6 “follows:

v@e The morithly DM 3.~ membership dues. For the
_ 20,000 members, this amounts’ to DM 60,000 per month
or DM. 720,000 a year.

b, Subscription fees for publications.

¢. Single donations from financially well-to-do
members and supporters.

d, Admission fees for political rallies. The BEV

has registered, since May 1966 when the NPD began its
campaign in Bavaria, a total of more than 2900 polit-
decal rallies in Bavaria. Although at times more than
one. third.of those attending. such rallies were -
estimated to be opposed to the NPD, everyone attending
the rally paid an admission fee. The BfV estimates
that the NPP has heen able through the above sources
of income to collect from DM 3,000,000 to D¥ 4,000,000.
The LfV are watching this funding quite closely,
particularly for evidence of financing from Communist
countries, Thus far they have been unable to sub-
stantinté the existence of any such support, Although
there is-no firm evidence of actual financial support
of the NPD from Communist sources, the BfV is aware

of nn interest'on the part of the Eastern inte)ligeace
services to penetrate the NPD anc monitor its activities.

At the instigation of Fedesal Ministe> of interior Luecke,
the B£V has undertaken to establish a confidential cll-party
committec consisting of mempers of the Social Democratic
Party (SPD), Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the Christian
Democratic Union (COU) and the Trade Union Movement (DGB)

to counter the NPD in Rheinland-Pfalz prior to the upcoming
elections in spring’ 1967. All of the parties have agreed
to participate and this activity is moving ahead. Recently
at a two-day conference chaired by the BfV in‘’a village

on the Mosel River, it was decidéd not only to counteract
NPD. propaganda during the election campaign, but also to
undertake orientation lectures for all officials in the.
Rheinland~Pfalz and other local governments who have shown
NPD leanings. These courses will be launched as soon as y
the campaign gets underway. A similar propaganda and
ofientation activity-is also being planned for the elections
in Schleswig-Holstein.in 1967.

“The BfV has persuaded the DGB to set up an action group
aimed at organizing the Labor movement into countering the

influence of the NPD. The BfV is assisting the DGB in
working out methods for the infiltration of workers into
NPD organizations to report and counteract their influence
within factories and workers councils. , The BfV has also
established contact with the German Industrial Institute

; Which is ‘sponsored by the German equivalent of 1
the U.S, National AsSociation of Manufacturers. The BfV ~ |

i

used as an argument withthe industrialists the fact that
_Anéreasing. influence of the NPD in Gernan industry would
have a-negative.effect upon foreign trade.”

The BEV undertook a-survéy of the election results at the
Lin. Land Hesse. This survey showed i
that the NPD had substantial success in‘areas containing 4
Gernan nilitary. installations. It was further determined
“that -the NPD‘ had conSiderable appeal amang non-conmissioned
professional soldiers who feel. they have failed to find B
acceptance in the postwar German society. This negative Seema
attitude has been less among Bundeswehr officers and draftees {
than among; non-commissioned officers, who feel theriselves under-
-paid and lacking in social acceptance. The B{V has contacted {
1

the sécurity organizations of the Bundeswehr to under-
take a ‘program of orientation to counter the influence of
the NPD within the Bundeswehr,

Headquarters Comment: CS-311/16288-66 from a different
