It Is obvious that he would I4k another opportunity to work

on this problen. He said that, at the time he had more contact with

Fader Castio than any othar

there because of his fluent

Spanish. He thought that the good rapprt that he had had with Castro

might possibly at some future time be useful, to the organization. He

rocalled one evening in the Sierra Maestra, whan he sat alone at a

campfire with Castro, discussing with Castro his problems for a matter

of four hours. Castro at that time was arous to have planes and

partileularly wanted a hellocopter with an Anarican pilot. NOEMAYR

suggested the name of a Iriend of his in Dayton who could provide the

hollocopter and asked Castro shat he would be willing to pay. Castro

said he would pay $25,000 (US Currency) for the machine and the going

rate of salary for the pilot. NOEMAIR reported this matter to Head

quarters and thought it unfortunate that this had not been capitalized

upon since KUBARI could have had a penetration in the Castro Inner
