LIMAD, NOXMAYR made an aside coment in response to BYNAM's
‘ query whether LIMAD was of any value, to the extent that LIMAD
at least is in the women's movement; and as long as no other
patter sources is available, it would not be wise to drop her,

-de - NOEMAYR's sister-in-law, Isabel per
formed some services for the organization f the
period that she was the secretary of a Swiss there in-

1991 or 1952. The Swiss appeared suspicious to the Station, and

she was instructed by NOZMAYR to prepare the ground for surrepti-

tious entry into his office for access to his files. Consequently,

she has knowledgs of something of the nature of NOEMAYR's interests.

An that he was working against the CP and that
NORMA ODYOKE connections. Antonio also did a few KUCAGE

jobs such as painting slogans on walls, for which he wes paid.

WOEMAIR commented that he saw some of these slogans still on the
- walls when he visited San Jose in January, 1960.

f. NOEMAYR's relatives are not aware of his affiliation
with ODYOKE, know only his cover stories. His parents

he  NOEMAYR was asked to elicit further data on his sister-in-
law, Consuelo, who is living with him at this tims. In particular, he
was to get a record of her employment since 1957, including dates,
names, addresses and typs of work. He said this could be done easily
without arouding her suspicions on the basis that he needed the infor-
mation for income tax purposes since she now counted as his dependent.

5. NOEMAYR remarked that he had gotten a loan of $700 from the
game bank which provided him the loan for the purchase of his automo~
pile and that with this additional lean, he would be able to cover the
purchase of whatever furniture he would need. He said that the bank
loan would cost him $64.10 per month for twelve (12) months as opposed
to something over $66 per month for twelve months had he taken it
through the Credit Union. BYNAM asked if he was certain he could
carry the two obligations. He said that he hod worked the figures
out and felt confident that he would have no problem in meting these
obligations. He showed BYNAM a copy of his budget. NOEMAYR said,
however, that he 1s counting on early reinbursement of the temporary
housing allowance for his initial month in the United States. BYNAM
said he would look into this.

he should recognize him or not. Since NOEMAYR is continuing under deep

recalled one evening in the Sierra Masstra, whan he sat alone at a
campfire with Castro, discussing with Castro his problems for a matter
of four hours. Castro at that time was amclous to have planes and
particularly wanted a heliccopter with an American pilot. WOEMAYR
suggested the name of a friend of his in ould provide the
heliccopter and asked Castre what he would be willing to pay. Castro
said he would pay $25,000 (US Currency) for the machines and the going
rate of salery for the pilot. NOEMAYR reported this matter to Head-
quarters and thought it unfortunate that thia had not
