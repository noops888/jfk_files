CONTINUATION OF

OISPATCH.

3.

AVCLATTER/1 departed the Miant area for Chicago on

13 August where he will undergo a four week training period with

the Rauland Corporation, a subsidiary of the %oni:h Radio Corporation.

The Rauland Corporation, which manufactures color IN tubes, employs

a large number of Cubans, and is in the process of hiring

additional

emplojees from among the

Cuban refugees in Miami.

AMCLATTER/1, with

our guidance and assistance, ;ent a

letter of application to the

Personnel Director of the Zenith Radio Corporation providing back

ground data on himself.

A copy of the letter is boing forwarded

under separate cover enclosure for Headquariors' files.

quently

was interviewed in Miami by company porsonnel officials who

visited Miami in late July, and was hired in a supervisory position

which will involve his working in a liaison capacity between manage-

ment and the Cuban work force.

He was promised a salary of approxi-

mately $180 a week per 60-hour work week, plus reimbursement for the

expenses of moving his family and household effects from Miami to

Chicago.

He has expressed his indebtedness to us for helping him

obtain

position,

and is eager to make good

since he believes

that we were instrumental in his getting the job.

4.

As explained in Reference A, AMCLATTER/l's contract was not

renewed in April 1966 because plans were underway at that time to

terminate him.

His performance for the past soveral months has been

practically nil, not because he has not been onger for work, but

mainly due to the fact that he is not suited for what has to be

done.

He started working for JMWAVE in April 1960 as a Principal Agent, and

during the period preceding the Bay of Pigs he handled a number

political action agents and spotted and developod several candidates

for recruitment.

Since much of this activity was more overt than

covert, he was thoroughly blown as a WOFACT asset, and eventually

became known in the

area as a sort of WOFACT spokesman, a role which

he enjoyed and encouraged.

As times changed and the Station began

concentrating on more covert activities, AMCLATTER/1 becamo something

of & security problem, since any statements or opiniong expressed by

him concerning various Individuals or exile groups were otther ma

takon for "official lenks" or "policy".

him.

Perhaps he was right

since it became obvious ii the past

several months that he had little aptitude for debriefing refuges

or handling contacts.

In any ovent,

we felt that in all fairness

to. ANCLATTER,

that he should be

terminated at the first suitable

opportunity and in a manner that would be helpful and

beneficial

to him.

It was also preferable to get him settled outside the

JMMAVE area.

He himself realized that he was getting older, and

that there was little opportunity for him iu the type of work that

he was doing for JMAVE.

The job that he has obtained in Chicago

represents a real break for him as well as a considerable increase

in

salary. We feel he deserves this break and hope he porforms

well.

7.

There were no major security violations on AMCLATTER/1'S

part.

His home address did appear on a PBRUMEN intelligence service

censorship list which possibly contained the names and/or addresses

of alleged PBRUMEN intelligeuce agents in WOLADY, but the vallaity

of the list was never fully confirmed and he was

SGSWIRLED on this

matter in April 1964 with overall favorable results. Because of his

six year association with JMWAVE, he has been exposed to a number of

case officers;

some of whom he knows by true name, and whuse identi

tles are listed in Paragraph 3 of his PRQ Part II. Thay can be

obtained from there if necessary•

8.

AMCLATTER/l completed a six weeks basic tradecraft course

In New

York City In September 1964.

He has had no other formal

WOFACT training.

He had no logistical material assigned to him at

the time of his

termination.
