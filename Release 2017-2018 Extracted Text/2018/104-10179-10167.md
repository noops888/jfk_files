MEMORANDUM FOR : Chief, Special Affaire Staff

ATTENTION

: Ms. A. Rodrigues

SUBJECT

: Radio Switch Equipment for Demolition

Firing Purposes

ử to the di can than i djong as do , hero

the question was discussed with Mr.L

UTSD/AOB, and

Mr o

bTSD/QRF. The following information if forwarded

for your consideration as a result of our discussions.

Audio Operations Branch, recommenda two

companies as sources of equipment of thie nature.

These companies

have experience, under clasnified contracts with TSD, in producing

reliable equipment for apecial purposes of this sort. They also,

of course turn out commercial equipment of good quality for normal

communications needo, These a moanies are:

a. (Motorola, Chicago, Illinois )

Kell, Cambridge, Massachusetta 29,08

The TSD VHF radio swilth equipment for demolitica needs was

developed for us by Motorola.

Jransistorined sets har

en produced to meút the special needa (rot for demolition purpose

of other SAS projects.

3. In the opinion of both persons consulted, the expensés noted

in our fires discusaion should have produced a reasonable amount of

workable equipment il the source was both capable and reliable.

I'SD recommeado the use of frequencien ia the VHF/WHY spectruin los

equipment of this sort and crystal tuning control for reasons of reliabilly,

selectivity and rejection of spurious signalo.

1. Inexpensive equipment of Japanese or American manufacture

in the eltinent band frequency ranges for 80ys, radio control deviceo.

short range communications, ete., is available from many

manufacturers. Our Quick Reaction Facility can produce a

small number of radio switches based on these devices with a

onsiderably lester degree of security kom false signal triggerin

vith a lead time of 6 to 8 weeks. Simple mechanical protectio

against accidental triggering can be gained by inclusion of counting

switches, for example, which require a preset number of firing

Impulses intentionally transmitted to produce the final closure of

a relay and firiog of a charge.

5. Reliability of operation in terme of response to a

tranomitted signal of a given power is quite difficult to predict when

conditione of antenna length, orientation and exposure cannot be

foreseen. Location of the receiver in a target building will also have

a strong bearing on 'range' from the transmitter. Building construction,

intervening obstacles and interference from other nearby radio fre.

quency sources will affect performance of the set.

6. If you wish to discuss the problems in greater depth,

we recommend a conference with audio 'echniciane or engineer.

It may serve to clarily the appropriate haracteristica which special or m

modified commercial equipment shoule possess to meet the needs of your

operation Pablems of camouflaging the explosive or incendiary material

to serve operational reguirements would be minor compared to the

necessary consideration of effects on the receiver switch concealed

within which could have important effects on performance.
