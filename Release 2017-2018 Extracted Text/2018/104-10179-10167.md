SUBJECT 2 Radio Switch Equipment for Demolition
Firing Purposes

bject on 30 December,

od 1, After our conversation ont
the question was discussed with Mr. TSD/AOB, and
Mr. ITSD/QRF, The following information i¢ forwarded
i eon. }

eration as a result of our discussions,

a Be Mel} Anate Operations Branchy-recommends two
companies as sources of equipment of this nature, These companies
have experience, under classified contracts with TSD, in producing
reliable equipment for special purposes of this sort. They also,
of course turn cut commercial equipment of good quality for normal
communications needs, These rh aed are:

‘

a.(Motorola, Chicago, Mlinois >
b( Kell, Cambridge, Massachusetts ) 24,08

‘The TSD VHF radio switth edulpacnt for demolition needs was
developed for ua by(Mctorola. ee sets have
been produced to mest the special needa (16t for demolition purposes)
of other SAS projects,

3. In the opinion of both persons consulted, the expenses noted
in our first discussion should have produced a reasonable amount of
workable equipment if the source was both capable and reliable.
‘SD recommends the use of frequencies in the VHF/WHF spectrum for
‘equipment of this sort and crystal tuning control for reasons of reliability,
selectivity and rejection of spurious signals.

4. Inexpensive equipment of Japanese or American manufacture
in the citisen'’ band frequency ranges for toys, radio control devices,

short range communications, etc., is available from many
manufacturers, Our Quick Reaction Facility can produce a

small number of radio switches based on these deviczs with a
considerably lester degree of security from false signal triggering
with a lead time of 6 to & Weeks, Simple mechanical protection
against accidental triggering can be gained by inclusion of counting
switches, for example, which require a preset number of firing
impulses intentionally transmitted to produce the final closure of

a relay and firing of a charge.

5. Reliability of operation in terms of response toa
transmitted signal of a given power is quite difficult to predict when
conditions of antenna length, orientation and exposure cannot be
foreseen, Location of the receiver.in a target building will also have
@ strong bearing on ‘range! from the transmitter. Building construction,
intervening obstacles and interference from other nearby radio fre~
quency sources will affect performance of the set.

6. Ifyou wish to discuss the prot'ems in greater depth,
we recommend a conference with audio ‘echniciane or engineera.
It may serve to clarify the appropriate --haracteristics which special or m
modified commercial equipment shoulé possess to megt the needs of your
operation, Putblems of camouflaging the explosive or incendiary material
to serve operational requirements would be minor compared to the
necessary consideration of effects on the receiver switch concealed
within which could have important effects on performance,
