MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Agent in Charge
Miami Field Office

SUBJECT : Field Office Memorandd Tune 1969
Re: isco
RONA{Alonso}.,
” by Ath eintbtinsrertersrercrentl
“1, Ihave nav read with care the referenced memorandum

which deals specifically with charges by a former agent Wilfredo
"Pancho" VARONA zgainst his handler known as "Frank" or
Enrique. As you wil have perceived from reading VARONA's
file by the time you read this memorandum, Mr. VARONA is not
well regarded by ou: Station and/or the people who have handled
him.to date. This constitutes the reason for his termination. I
would also like you"o examine the field traces on Mr. Charles
GOVEA, an attachrnt to this memorandum. These traces
indicate that Mr. GOVEA has had in the past, and possibly still
may have, some coriact with Castro intelligence organizations.
We are presently wciting for a more complete read-out on Mr.
GOVEA from the Nev York Office of the FBI. Understandably,
therefore, you can iee we leok somewhat.askance at the GOVEA/
VERONA information. Although we recognize the integrity of
the unwitting internediary Mr. Winston Guest of Palm Beach,
Florida, we also re:ognize the implications for Frank" in Mr,
GOVEA's knowledg: of our affairs given his ‘possible Castro
intelligence connectcn. Axiomatically, we will be interested in
knowing, at some pont in the near future, whether "F rank's"
true identity is knovn by either VARONA or GOVEA.

2. Lhave dicussed this memorandum in detail with
"Frank", Our vievi on VARONA's allegations are presented
below, keyed to you: basic memorandum.



a. is paragraph 4 of your memorandum of
1l- June 196%
63

Br. VA) ited sometime
during 1957 xy Mr. en assigned to
the Agency’: Station in Havana. He was subsequently

handled by k= nother Agency Officer
presently sutioned in Kingston, Jamaica. Later, still

in Cuba, he vas handled by Mr. Frank Belsito now serving
in Panama aid Emilio Rodriguez (deceased.) Mr. Rodriguez
turned Mr. ARONA over to "Frank" in November 1960.

In August 1911, Mr. VARONA took asylum in the Brazilian
Embassy indavana. He was later granted "salvo conducto"
to Rio de Jaaeiro. In the interim "Frank" was exfiltrated
from Cuba tothe U.S. When Mr. VARONA arrived in the
Florida arez during March 1962, he was met by his Hevana
Case Officer ''F rank" who continued to handle him until
August 1962, at which time he was turned over to the Greek
Case Offic e refers to. The Greek Case Officer handled
him for app:oximately three years. Along about 1965, the
Greek Case 2fficer turned Mr. VARONA over to Mr. Al

" McQuade aki Fred who handled Mr. VARONA until May

1968, at whi:h time he was turned over to "Pepe" intro-
duced by "F:ank" who served as an intermediary because
of his previms connection with Mr. VARONA. Pepe's
specific job vas to give Mr. VARONA one last chance to
prove that h: could be productive before being terminated.
erienced agent handler's problems with Mr.
precisely like those of his predecessors.
ARONA to be untruthful, bellicose and
tisfactory for any form of continued employ-
ment by WE “liami. Therefore, after due consideration
of Mr. VAL.UNA's potential to cause trouble because of
his long ex nce with the Agency, the decision was
taken to terninate him recognizing full well there might
be security *:percussions.



In thu light of the foregoing, it is worrisome
to find out tlat Mr. VARONA is aware that "Frank"
recently recived transfer orders from the Organization.
We need moe information on this. We suspect that the
origin of thie statement is the fact that Mr. VARONA
recently mot"Frank" on the street in Mexico City by
complete haypenstance. During that meeting "Frank"
alluded to th: fact that he was no longer working in
Miami (althgh in fact he was) to confuse Mr. VARONA
as to his trm whereabouts. It should be noted that Mr.
VARONA re@rs to "Frank''as "Frank" because at one
point during the time that he was being handled by
"Frank", otl:rwise known as Enrique, he instructed
Mr. VAROR#.to introduce him to the Vasco de CUNHA
family as "Frank" Stevens, otherwise he had known
"Frank" untir the name, Enrique. The basis for Mr.
VARONA sasing that he believed "Frank" mishandled
the WOFIRMN program in many ways appears to be
vituperation zlus frustration. The vituperation being
a basic ingystient in his opportunistic character.

b. Fe paragraph 5 of your memorandum of
11 June 1966

That "Frank" had certain responsibilities
re Juanita Cistro is very true. "Frank" was funda-
mentally resyonsible for the defection of Juanita Castro
although Mz. VARONA furnished the lead. The "Prank" /
Juanita Cast:o relationship is now quasi-legendary. He
did not fumbe the very difficult handling of this contro-
versial pers:in. Mr. VARONA would have been in no
position to Inow the load placed upon "Frank'' by the
Agency in trring to gain operational mileage from Miss
e information that ''Frenk'' was in posses-~
sion of information which could have resulted in the
assassinatim of Fidel Castro, the following comment
must be mace: _This refers to the Plan RAPHAEL which



involved Mr. VARONA's prother. "Frank" was not
the Case Offi:er on this operation, although he had
originally verruited Mr. VARONA's brother in Cuba
prior to his sxfiltration. The Case Officer for the
RAPHAEL ojeration, if one considers that there was
a case office, would have been Stephen P. Mangello.

-Re Mr. VARONA's charge that five of his family went to

jail in Cuba and four of his friends "went to the wall" in
Cuba because: of the shortcomings of "Frank," "Frank" has
the following specifically to say in rebuttal:

tyAZONA was continuously admonished from
the time of itis arrival in the U.S. in ‘March 1962 to
be discreet soncerning his connection as well as his
relatives! cmmection with the Agency. It was common
knowledge ir. the exile community that VARONA and
his family vere dedicating their lives to the overthrow
of Castro, No member of VARONA's family was
molested by Castro until the exfiltration of VARONA's
brother in 1964. VARONA's prother left a wife and
two childrex: behind and later within a period of three
months initzted divorce proceedings. VARONA's
brother anc probably his wife, and possibly other
the family knew of Plan RAPHAEL. It
would be diZicult, if well nigh impossible, to ascertain
who could live been the cause of the arrest of members
of VARON£'s family, since besides the family members,
other agems who were also involved in this Plen were
arrested at ipproximately the same time. Re the four
friends “vriv went to the wall, ' this appears to be sheer
embellishrent on the part of Mr. VARONA."

c. Re paragraph 6 of your memorandum of
11 June 19:

Mr. VARON:. is not informed on other Station
operations, :o it is understandable that in his
attempt to beng attention to himself that he
would focus in those things he is aware of.

Mr. VARON:'s opinion of Mr. SANGENIS and
his handling af money is his own opinion. The
Station's viev is that it is lamentable that Mr.
VARONA, over the years, did not show the same
amount of personal dedication to getting the job
done that M:: SANGENIS has shown. Again, it
appears to m one more vituperative allegation
which ha's litle basis, based on information so far
provided by Mr. VARONA.

d. Xe paragraph 7 of your memorandum of
11 June 196%

*WARONA was in fact the messenger sent
by 'Frank''<o the person who was going to conduct
the exfiltraton of "Frank" and several co-workers

% should be noted that Mr. Ose ONDAVILA,-—
presently liung in Miami, is ‘the brothe:“of a prominent
Communist in Cuba today and should be viewed in that
light. "Fraik's" recollection of the situation involving
servants ant the ASPRU home, which he took over with
the servants, does not jive with Mr. VARONA's report.
There were ~vo white and two black servants in the
house. The right of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban
Internal Service sent agents to the ASPRU home to pick
up "Frank.' One colored and one white servant were at
home at thaitime and they told the DSE agents that
"Prank" was ‘a gay blade" and would not be home until
early the ne: morning. The DSE left the residence
leaving behiul a note for "Frank" to report to their
headquarter: the following morning. In this context,
it should be .wted that Frank's" cover in Cuba during
the period in. question was that of a professional gambler;
a cover whim served him well during most of his service
there.



h. Ee paragraph 12 of your memorandum of
11 June 196+:

() "Frank" has no knowledge of the material
referred to. A further check will be made to determine
if this information was passed to "Pepe" who wo uld have
made it avaiable to the Station.

receiving trie copies of this material so that it can be

ated if your zffice could glean the source or sources of

2. If you read the foregoing analysis in the light of Mr.
NVARONA's file, I believe you will clearly ascertain that we
put little, if any, c:nfidence in any statements made by Mr.
VARONA. We are deeply troubled, however, by the fact that
Mr. VARONA has used one Mr. Charles SONESN shis means?

has any current npnghip with Cuban intelligence and to that
end, we have urgeniy requested from the Bureau any and all
current information bearing on the matter. Although Mr.
VARONA cannot provide Cuban intelligence through Mr. GOVEA
anything really current, he could albeit unwittingly provide a
tremendous amount of information dealing with Agency modus
operandi which we vould not like them to have. This becomes
quite important in view of the fact that we have several indications
of aggressive DGI/EN operations to gain information on the AMOT
as well as our AMCR2AFT operations.

3. Your pazegraph 15 clearly reveals the fact that
VARONA has an ax: to grind and he has chosen this way of
reingratiating him: with the Agency by passing information
on "Frank" the mar who handled him for the longest period of
time. For tactical yolitical reasons you may deem it wise to
"receive his report?’ under no circumstances, however, would
we want this to be ured as a bridge to become involved in again
with a man in who tegrity or objectivity we have no confidence
whatsoever. To r rate re the previous paragraph, we are most
concerned about GC’EA and if we can develop any current infor-
mation on Mr. GO 's contacts with Cuban intelligence, we
believe it will be ne::ssary to get some word to Mr. Guest to
disengage himself m1. contact with this person.



4, This menorandum has not been completely researched.
It is suggested, how:ver, that you forward it with your memorandum
of 11 June 1969 to y:r office ‘so'that this matter may be placed in
perspective, : . :

5. I would eppreciate notification when you forward your
memorandum to you Headquarters'as I would like to furnish a
copy simultaneously along with my ‘analysis of the situation. I
appreciate your pranptness in bringing the VARONA/GOVEA
contact. to my attention.
