The Johnson Era ¢pikms

For most employees of the Federal government, work
continues unchanged when a new President moves into the
White House. Employees of the Bureau of Reclamation, the
Labor-Management Services Administration, or the Commodity
Exchange Authority all go about their jobs in their ac-
customed ways, though changes of administration policy can
ultimately have an effect. Even the pattern of most intel-
ligence work--collection and the production of finished
intelligence for a considerable number of officials--remains
undisturbed. But for these who are turning out intelligence
specifically for the President, everything is apt to change
as soon as a new Chief Executive takes over. !ow wide-
ranging will the new President's interest in foreign
countries and in international relations be? Hew much
appetite will he have fer intelligence? “ Will large and
frequent servings be in order, or modest portions only as
absolutely required? Will he want merely facts, or facts
plus interpretation and analysis? Separated or homogenized?
Is he willing to read a regular intelligence document, or
does he prefer to be briefed?

established a satisfactorv channel directly to the President.

to the next. iisenhewer did not want the personal weelly
briefing frcm the Director that Truman hed received; the
General preferred to a weekly
meetings of the National Security Council. Kennedy did

not like to use the NSC with any recularity. Instead he
found just what he wanted in the personal, daily intelligence
Checklist devised for him five months after he entered office.

The Checklist system worked so well with Kennedy that
OCI and the Director naturally honed to continue it with
Lyndon Johnson, especially as it became apparent that
Johnson, like his predecessor, was not going to have regular
NSC meetings. lventually OCI succeeded, but after many
months of frustration. It was only when he had a firm hold
of his administration and when certain foreign situations
forced themselves upon his attention that President Jchnson
discovered the usefulness of a daily current intelligence
document. .

For a few days after the assassination of President
Kennedy, R. J. Smith took the Checklist to DCI McCone at
East Building at 8:30 a.m. The Director then held a staff
meeting, after which R. J. Smith personally took the
Checklist to Bromley Smith and Gen. Clifton in the White
House. The briefing of Presicent Johnson from the Checklist,
however, was done by McCone, who saw the President daily for

On 5 December, the President held a meeting cf the NSC
to which the chairmen and enn SaaS Of the leading
Congressional committees were invited. Most of the guests
had to be hurriedly briefed on COMINT. Clinton P. Conger,
Chief of OCI's Presentations Branch and the office's briefing
drafter, put together the intelligence presentation on the
Soviet military position, which was presented by DCI McCone.
Conger was present at the briefing to handle the charts on ~
the easel. Before the meeting started, the President gave
a nod and in came his photographer, Okimoto. He began

shooting pictures left and right. McCone was aghast, finally

Johnson did not have a large number of NSC meetings, but
when he did they ncrmally began with an intelligence
briefing, usually prepared by Conger on the basis of
materials frem OCI, OSR, and OER, as appropriate. 47/
Around the middle cf December, when McCone stopped
seeing the President daily, the White House staff tried to
the President to read the Checklist. They were largely
unsuccessful, although McGeorge Bundy was able to do some
oral briefing, Checklist in hand. On 16 December, Gen. |

Clifton told OCI's John Heidemann, "If we can't penetrate

this sort of wall today or tomorrow, we'll just have to try
something else." Cccasionally things went well. On the
18th, Clifton said that the staff had finally managed to get
the President to read "the bhooks"--probably two cr three
issues. i

At Christmastime, the President went to his Texas
ranch and shortly after Christmas had Chancellor Erhard as
a visitor for several days. The PICL was cabled to the ranch
each day. The report was limited to notes covering important
developments and any information that might be useful in the
talks with Erhard. The President returned to Washington or.
5 January, and the next day Gen. Clifton, who had been at
the ranch, told Meidemann that Re had been able to get the
Checklist to the President with some regularity once Erhard

had gone.

On 8 January, however, Clifton was having difficulties
again-~the President had not read the intelligence document
since leaving Texas. Clifton thought there would be a little
let-up in the press of business after that day's State of
the Union speech. He asked Philip Kennedy for a special
report, briefly treating important and still-current
problems that were covered in the beoks the President hadn't
read. Clifton thought, in fact, that it would be good to
try the system of giving the President a summary of signi-
ficant intelligence twice a week.

OCI auickly put together an experimental President's
Intelligence Review, covering the period 4-9 January. This
was taken by Richard Lehman, Assistant for Special Projects,
to Gen. Clifton on 9 January. Clifton thought the Review
was the best solution to the problem of the President's
intelligence reading. He and Bundy were agreed that the
President would not accept a daily intelligence briefing.

The President had instructed Clifton that the DCI was to

see him whenever he wished but that otherwise the President
relied on Bundy and Clifton to stay on top of the intelligence.
Because the President was likely to ask them with no warning
for the latest word, the daily Checklist had to continue.
Clifton suggested that the Checklist periodically include a
special blue- or green-bordered page containing an operational

42
report. 2/

EEE aaa TOP SECRET

The next morning Gen. Clifton called Lehman to report
that the White Mouse was very pleased with the Review, and
wanted it continued. It had been tried on the President at
breakfast and it had "worked like a charm." By

Because the President was not reading the Checklist
every day, DCI McCone wanted it sent to a few more high-
level officials beyond the small circle of readers in
Kennedy's time--the Secretaries of State and Defense,
McGeorge Bundy at the White House, and the Chairman of i
the Joint Chiefs. Therefore he cbtained permission in
February to extend the dissemination to four additional
top officials in the State Department, two more in Defense,
one on the Joint Chiefs staff, plus the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Attorney-General. Y

Besides doing the semi-weekly Review and the PICL,

OCI was writing memoranda.in response to requests from the
White House staff, and DCI McCone was briefing the President
from time to time. The Checklist writers still took the
publication to Bromley Smith and Gen. Clifton each morning”
and received their comments, plus occasional playback from
the President. When unusually interesting items in the PICL
caught his eye, Clifton would make a point of bringing them
to the President's attention. én 21 January, for example,

he was taken with an item featuring quotable statements by

bragaing about new rockets, but said, "All the same, you

cannot put a r et inte. soup.") A few days later, when it
looked a though war would break out on Cvnorus at any time
Gespite a strong US mediation effort, Clifton instructed
OCI to keep the White Hevse "un to the ninute" on develop-
ments. "Hours will make the difference," he said.

Gen. Clifton told James Hanrahan on 28 January that
he had talked with the President about the Intelligence :
Review and Mr. Johnson had sai¢é it was just fine. He found
it a very valuable supplement to his occasional briefings
from the DCI and he wanted it continued without change.

On 25 March the President's plans to spend a weekend
in Texas prompted Gen. Clifton to comment that Mr. Johnson
read his intelligence while at the ranch; he was often up and
asking for it by @:15 a.m. But it was hard to catch him in
Washington. The next day Clifton said that it was not
necessary for the OCI representatives to meet him at 9:30
a.m., the book did not move upstairs that fast. He asked
that the meetings take place at 10 in the future.

Early in 1964, the President drew his aides Bill Moyers
and Jack Valenti into the intelligence picture. He wanted
one of them present when he read ‘the Review at breakfast
and he was reported occasionally as discussing Checklist

items with them. Although the PICL writers continued to

ment for Cline making the principal neints that it fealine wav
of knowing whether it was mecting the President's needs he-
cause it had no feedback from him, in contrast to the situation
under Kennedy. The reason for this was that OCI's contacts
at the White House did not deal Girectly with the President
on intelligence matters. OCI hoped to be able to establish
close links to the President's immediate staff. °*6/

Things remained in a confused state for the next few
months, with only occasional indications that OCI's vresi-
dential publications had hit the mark. Clifton commented
in May that the Review was the best means of reaching the :
President, although he said the PICL registered at times
when Valenti was interested in an item. There were days
when the President read and initialed both the Review and
the PICL. One day when the PICh was heavy on the side of

bad news, Clifton said, “It's no wonder the President doesn't

want to read this stuff--it annoys you." From mid-year on,
Mr. Johnson made frequent campaign trips around the country.
Cliftcen, who was usually with him, said he had more luck
getting the President to reac his intelligence om the return
flights than on the way out, when Mr. Johnson was studying
his speeches.

As the election neared, Secretary of State Rusk exvressed
some concern to McCone about the security of the Checklist
and seemed to prefer that dissemination he limited to the
President, Secretary of Defense McNamara and himself. McCone
passed the word down and also conveyed his feelina that the
President should read the Checklist daily, or have it read
to him, and should not depend on the semi-weekly Review. “3/

AD/CI R. 3. Smith responded in a memorandum of 5 November
1964. He believed that the Agency would have a araceful way
of Gropping some of the Checklist readers if the publication
were to undergo a transformation in which it would acquire a
new name, a new cover, and a. new format. It would become
President Jchnson's publication, specifically designed to
meet his needs. To increase the chances of its being read
by the Chief Executive, it would he produced to conform to the
President's working habits and would be delivered in late

afternoon. Smith noted that the Review, which Mr. Johnson

“usually reads," was timed for his evening perusal. Smith

also noted the importance of finding a way to establish
direct contact with the President so that OCI could get

fs ae ‘ ‘
feedback and thus avoid writing in a vacuum. 2@/

The PDB Avpears

Smith's preposal for a new publication was accepted
and was rapidly put into effect. The last Checklist was
dated 30 November 1964 and the next day the first issue of the

President's Daily Brief (PDB) was delivered to the White House.

In substance it reserbled the PICL, but it had a fresh apvear-
ance--chiefly because it was printed on legal-sized paper--
and it came cut late in the afternoon instead of early in

the morning. Jack Valenti sent this first issue back to
McGeorge Bundy saying that the President read it, liked it,
and wanted it continued. Dissemination was cut back, so that
the only persons receiving the PDB outside the White House
were the Secretary and Under Secretary of State, the Secretary
of Defense, the Deputy Secretary and one Assistant Secretary,
the Treasury Secretary, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and
Gen. Carroll, the head of DIA.

The semi-weekly Review was dropped, but by 16 December
the DCI ordered that a summary of OCI's Current Intelligence
Weekly Review be included with “each Friday's PDB. The summary,
titled Highlights of the Week, lasted only until 26 February

1965, having failed to arouse presidential interest.

In the ersuing weeks and months, OCI was naturally
watching for indications of the success or failure of the
restyled daily for the Fresident. On 13 January, PDB writer
Thomas Patton noted that Bromley Smith wrote "The President"

in the upper right corner of Copy 4 1. Patton asked whether

Smith would like OCI to type this cn. No, said Smith, putting
it on in long-hand gave it a human touch.

On 18 January, the Brief went from a legal-sized to a
letter-sized document as a result of discussions between
McGeorge Bundy and Ray Cline. Bromley mith said he liked
the new format and he thought the South Vietnam item was

that Saigon had a new cabinet. The President, Smith said,

was not interested in the names of generals and ministers

and didn't follow such details.

Further experiments in page size followed a talk McCone
had with the President, but nothing came of them. There was
even a sarple Brief that the President could put in his pocket,
though the thought of having sensitive material handled this
way made Bromley Smith groan.

In mid-February, Bromley Smith said that the Vietnam
situation report, which OCI had begun sending to the White
House daily at 8 a.m., was provirig to be very useful; it was

going up to the President every morning.

It should not be imagined that the PDP writers always
transacted their business with Fromley Smith in tranauillity.
Occasionally there was a certain amount of commotion around
Smith's office because of people coming and going to different
meetings in the White Heuse. One day Smith closed his door,
explaining that

The Impact of Santo Domingo

On 24 April 1965 events took place that had the effect
of improving the standing of OCI publications in the White
House. On that day an uprising began against the provisional
government of the Dominican Republic. The US fear that
Communists might seize control of the country led to the
prompt dispatch of Marines to Santo Domingo. By coincidence,
the day they landed--28 April--was also the day that Admiral
William Raborn was sworn in as DCI, succeeding John McCone.
President Johnson could hardly get enough intelligence on
the Dominican situation, and Admiral Raborn was determined
to provide the best service possible. The day after he took |
office, the Admiral ordered the establishment of a CIA task
force on the Dominican Republic under E. Drexel Godfrey,

~ chief of OCI's Western Area. As directed, it provided

(es

“complete and around-the-clock CIA intelligence support to

the White House." Its first task each day was to brief Pahorn
to put him in readiness to deal with calls from the White House.
Periodically throughout the day and night it issued round-

up situation reports, and when necessary, spot revorts of
particular developments. All these reports were teletvped

to the White House. They were read by Mr. Johnson, who was

now described by Bromley Smith as a President "who eats up
information." OCI, of course, continued to put out its

regular publications. It was during the BDominican crisis that

word was received that the President's Daily Brief had taken

firm root in the White House. Pill Moyers said on 21 May
that the President read it "avidly." “oy
The increased temvo of intelligence service to the
Chief Executive prompted further consideration of the proper
way to get material to him. DDCI Richard Helms and DDI Ray
Cline agreed that the NSC Staff (McGeorge Bundy, Bromley Smith,
and the White House Situation Room) should be ‘the place of
entry for intelligence for the President, although information
copies could be sent to Moyers and Valenti. Helms and Cline

The hectic atmosphere in the spring of 1965, with the
Dominican situation coming on top of growing difficulties
in Vietnam, caused the men in the White House to ask more of
intelligence and to react to it more sharply. Eromley
Smith said the President has a “very short reaction fuse."
He wanted to hear firstfrom official sources and not from
the press about major developments, so rapid dissemination
was essential. Smith also warned that OCI would soon be
asked, to report on every coup and to cover all present and
potential trouble spots with high precision. He said that
in the future, OCI's reports would not say that the Valencia
regime is shaky, but that "Valencia is going to be overthrown
by a coup on the umpteenth July by % in Toonerville." Since
this would be asking the impossible in most cases, Richard
Lehman, OCI's Assistant for Special Projects, went to see
Bill Moyers. He explained that OCI could write 50 pages
of intelligence warnings a day, thereby “taking out insurance
against any possible contingency, but that the office did not
believe this would really serve the President. Lehman said
OCI tried to be highly selective in warning of coups and the
like. Moyers expressed understanding of OCI's difficulties,
and the fire died down. ee This episode had an amusing
sequel about eight months later when BromleySmith pondered

the series of army coups in the republics cf West Africa.

He said he didn't think the President wanted or needed to be
informed in advance of every threatened coup. “Otherwise,”
he said, “you could fill the book with that sort of thing."
The system for supplying current intelligence to
President Johnson was now working better than previously.
To be sure, OCI did not benefit from the steady presidential
playback it had enjoyed under John Kennedy. On the other
hand, OCI was fairly confident that the President was reading
the PDP regularly, and the writers on the PDB team received
useful suggesticns, criticisms, and reactions--vsually from
Bromley Smith-~when.they delivered the publication each day.
One day in June 1965 the first paragraph of the lead
item in the PpB said “Accumulating information suggests that
Hanoi is bringing North Vietnam to a state of semi-mobilization."
The second paragraph explained that Hanoi's action was far
short of classic mobilization for offensive operations; OCI
considered the move defensive and was therefore inclined to
discount the view of one British expert who thought a larqe-
scale attack would soon be made across the 17th parallel.
President Johnson and Gen. Clifton at the time were at the
LBJ ranch. Late in the afternoon, the PDB received a phone
call from Bromley Smith, who said that Gen. Clifton had
called from the ranch. He had been shaken by the first
sentence of the Vietnamese item and was concerned about the

whole piece. The President was out on the lake and was not

expected back for several hours. Clifton at first felt he

should summon the President to shore. Smith discussed the

matter with the PDB writer, Thomas Patton, and there was

further conversation with Clifton, who decided simply to add

the word "but" after the first sentence and continue with

the somewhat reassuring second sentence. The case was a

vivid illustration of the potentiality o* the PDB for causing
excitement in the White House entourage.

wishes. For a considerable period of time, both the Kennedy
and Jehnson administrations had been trying to find a means
by which the supposed désire of some West Furopean countries
to share in the ownership and control of nuclear weapons
could be satisfied. The scheme that finally came to have
official backing was the proposed multilateral nuclear force
(MLF) of surface vessels with jointly owned nuclear weapons.
The ships were to be manned by mixed crews of personnel from
most NATC countries. Washington officialdom was sharply
divided over this proposal and the pro- and anti-MLF forces
steadily bombarded the White House with their arguments.
Towards the end of 1965, the White Nouse asked OCI for an
"objective" report on the status and implications of the
plan. The President's advisers sent the word that they

were "ecstatic" over the memorandum drafted hy Joe L. Zaring.

Soon afterwards, President Johnson dropped the MLF idea as

politically unfeasible and militarily unnecessary.

Eromley Smith now and then modified or rewrote PDR
items when he felt that they might confuse or unduly alarnf
the President. In December 1965, for example, President
Johnson ordered a halt in the bombing of Vietnam in the hope
of getting negotiations started. A PDB item reported that
Hanoi had broadcast a tough restatement of its position,
making no reference to the pause in air strikes. Smith,

afraid that this would be taken as a rebuff to the President's

q 4

efforts, reworked the text to avoid this internretation since
the broadcast. did not constitute a fully official government
statement.

Quite clearly, the White House staff cringed at bad
news from Vietnam. When the PDB reported in Avril 1966 that
"the political situaticn appears to be rapidly worsening" in
South Vietnam, and averred that Ky micht soon have to take
G@rastic measures to restore authority or make major concessions
to the Buddhists, Smith remarked that the article was pessi-
mistic and that he had later information. It was, of fen
one of the perils of the PDB operation that the White House
sometimes had fresher reports from the field. Smith handed
John Heidemann cebles reporting that Ky was going to formulate
a new constitution and that the State Department looked upon
this as hopeful. Heidemann agreed that OCI had written in
ignorance of this information, but added that offhand he
would not be optimistic.

A few days later Smith read in the PDB that "There was
no real improvement in the situation today..." and said
"You're going. to break the President's heart; he thinks
things are much better today." When he finished the whole
disheartening report, he tossed the book in the air, whistled,
and said, “We'll have fun tonight. But that's no reason for

not writing it as you see it."

Smith had cause for unhappiness again when the PDB had

to report that a Pakistan official felt that his country was

érifting apart from the US and would probably esteblish cleser

relationships with the Soviet Union. Smith told PDB writer
Allen Valpey that this article was a "shocker" and that
Walt Rostow would be disturbed by it. (Rostow had replaced
McGeorge Bundy in April 1966.)

Although John McCone had not taken up a White House
suggestion that the President's daily give occasional coverage
to CIA activities, Admiral Raborn as DCI aia adopt this
practice. Bromley Smith reacted negatively to these reports,
however, apparently believing that President Johnson did not
like them. He particularly objected in 1966 to a PDB Annex
explaining enthusiastically how CIA. used a portable ultra-
violet light device in. Vietnam to detect guerrillas who had
recently handled weapons before mingling’ with innocent
villagers. Smith did not want the Agency to “advertise"
in the PDB. He believed that if the President should he °
informed of seme CIA activities, the DCI should send him a
memorandum.

Late in July 1966 Bromley Smith said that he had some
ideas about the PDB and would like to get together with all
the writers. By this time R. J. Smith was DDI, E. Drexel
Godfrey was D/OCI and Richard Lehman was ND/OCI. Bromley

Smith met with them and the PDB writers in the Langley,

building on 3 August. He prefaced his remarks by expressing
his satisfaction with the way the President was being served;
he had no criticisms. Ne explained, however, that while
the President "tolerates" anonymous documents, he is much

more responsive to a personalized paper. He wondered whether

the Brief could be signed by Mr. Helms, now DCI. Then it

would become a personal link between the President and the
Director. In regard to content, fmith said the PDB did not
have to alert the President to impending crises over which

he would have no control. Rather, Smith thought the PDB

could be most useful by rendering pithy judgments on situations
with which the President is or will be faced. Smith said these
judgments would be accepted; OCI did not have to support them

with argumentation or evidence. Smith emphasized that the

Brief writers had to be fully up on US policies and should
read presidential speeches. He thought the President was
kept adequately informed of Vietnamese military developments
by other means; the PDB should carry more Vietnamese political
and economic items. fmith urged that the Brief increase its
coverage of Europe and said that Panama was another subject
high on the priority list. ay

Helms did not take up the igea of personally signing
the PDB, but OCI promptly set about adopting Smith's suggestions

as to content. Smith soon commented that he noticed the

change. Ox


TOP SECRET

The DDI Operations Center, under the executive direction
of the D/OCI, had superseded the Watch Office in 1965 and
played its role in supplying current intelligence to the
White Mouse. Whenever any information of great importance
came in at night, the Senicr Duty Officer would have the
White House Situation Room informed immediately. On most
of these occasions the SPO and the Watch Officers were
aware that the President was personally taking an interest
in the developments. Sometimes the initial report opened
up a sequence that involved many incoming messages, calls
to and from the White House, and hours of intensive work.
A classic example occurred when King Constantine made his
abortive attempt to overthrow the Greek junta in December
1967. The Operations Center got the werd about 3 a.m. that
Constantine planned to move within the next five hours.
Neil Huntley, the €DO, alerted DCI Helms, who told Huntley
to call Walt Rostow at his home, brief him, and carry out
any instructions of Rostow's. Rostow asked that the White
House Situation Room-be informed that he was on his way in
and would wake the President when he got there. Meanwhile,
Rostow wanted copies of the relevant cables sent to the
White House by LDX. About 7 a.m. Rostow called the
Operations Center to say that he had not received any
follow-up reporting from the Embassy or CIA station in

Athens. He asked Huntley to telephone the station and find

chief of station. Huntley went dewn to COMMO, kept the red-

Officer in turn keptthe secure line to the White House open.
After the chief of staticn gave an updated situation report,
Rostow fed questions to him and received answers via the

The Final Arrangement

A major alterfation in the PDB system occurred at the
end of February 1967. Seemingly all that was involved was
that President Johnson decided that he would rather get the
Brief in the morning than in the evening. This change in

delivery time, however, forced other changes. The President

‘wanted the B: f at 6:30 a.m., just before he began reading

the newspapers. This meant that OCI‘s closing time on the
book was 5 a.m. Nonetheless, the PDB haa to be written in
full knowledge..of what was in the morning press. As E.
Drexel Godfrey commented, the schedule put "the highest
premium on making the publication up to the minute." “¥s8/
Because the Brief now had to be delivered to the White
House Situation Room by 6 a.m., there was no longer a member /

of the President's staff up and available to receive the

~ book and comment on it. This meant that there was no point

I

in having the POR writers make the trip to the White House.
From this time on, the PDB was delivered by couriers. To
make up for the loss of the morning conversations with
Bromley Smith, an OCT staff member would visit him occa-
sionally to check on how things were going, and there was
also communication by phcne.

Shortly after the changeover to the new schedule for the
PDB, Eromley Smith, commenting on the President's reaction,
said emphatically that "we are much more certain now that
he's reading it." Ne also made a point he was to make several
times subsequently, which was that he disapproved of annexes
to the Brief. Ne was afraid that if the Brief were burdened
with an annex, the President would put it aside for later
reading--and then not get back te it. In Smith's view, the
PDB should be of a length which the President cculd whip
through quickly. It would be better, he insisted, if annex-
type reports were sent down separately. Smith thought it was
an excellent idea for the Brief to summarize the conclusions
of "important" national estimates. “16/

began to attach to the Rrief a Special Report on North

Vietnam that dealt mainly with the effects of the war.
The only copy to go outside of the Agency was addressed:
“For Bromley Smith - Eyes Only for the President." Beginning

at the President's Daily Brief. This homey picture epitomizes
the position OCI hoped the Brief occupied in the White House.

And perhaps it did.
