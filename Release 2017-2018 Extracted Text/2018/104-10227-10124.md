MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILES

SUBJECT: Treatment of Survivors

1. MANSON confirms that all five of th√© survivors who appeared
before the Taylor Committee reccived their $250.00 bonus in Miami.
However, ho admitted that they have not received the kind of attention
they should have received from AMIRON and AMBUD, This probably
due to the antagonism which has always existed between the personall-
ties of AMIRON/AMBUD and the camp leaders, MANSON ia very con-
scious of the need for careful handling of survivors and returnees and
ie planning to come up with specific recommendations on this subject,

2, Iasked Joe Langan to attempt to get from the five survivors a
statement of any unresolved complaints which they may have, Joe said
that three of them were leaving for New York City and the other two for
Miami almost immediately, He said each had been given $500 in addition
to the $125, 00 which they had received for expenses, and the $250, 00
bonus received in Miami, Joe has arranged a channe} of communication
between these men and ourselves for future use, He feels the granting of
the extra $500 will become known and that equal treatment will be demanded
by other survivors and returnees, .
