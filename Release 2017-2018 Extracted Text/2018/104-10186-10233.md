newspaperman, and possibly a Communist. PITA was born about 1941,
“PITA passed through Mexico City enroute to Latin America as a
Cultural Attache about April or May 1962. Source also stated that
PITA was rather. covardly' and timid, that he was afraid to leave the

appeared to be an opportunist rather than a Communist or pro-Castro
and possibly obtained his job through his father's influence.

In a report dated 12 March 1963, Felix PITA was identified as a.
Cuban intelligence officer under cover as the Cultural Attache in
the Cuban Embassy in Rio de Janeiro.
