Memorandum for Mr. Wannall :
RE: SENSTUDY 75 CONFIDE

Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Deputy Attorney
General, and Mr. John Warner, General Counsel, CIA, will
have a meeting with the Counsel of the SSC on Tuesday,
3/11/75, to work out precise wording for a Secrecy Agreement
that all members of the SSC staff have agreed to sign.

On 3/10/75 the staff of the SSC will convene to
develop a list of requirements that they expect to levy on
all agencies making up the Intelligence Community. Hopefully
Mr. Clarke will have some information on these requirements
prior to the time they are levied on the individual agencies.

As a result of Mr. Colby's appearance before the
House Government Information in Individual Rights Subcommittee,
Government Operations Committee, 3/5/75, CIA is getting many,
many, calls from Senators and Congressmen asking how they can
find out whether CIA has a file on them and what its contents
are. Mr. Clarke noted that members of the Group should
anticipate receiving similar calls from Congressmen. °(Y))

Mr. Hank Knocke, who heads up the CIA task force
responsive to the Rockefeller Commission, advised that staff
members of the Rockefeller Commission have been issued CIA
Hi 7 badges, occupy CIA office space, and have authority to
|i. .*-m|personally contact any CIA employee without clearing such
{contact with CIA officials. In addition, the Rockefeller
Commission staff employees have been granted access to CIA
files, After reviewing these files, if the staff decides to
make certain portions of the files a matter of official
Commission business, CIA has a right to excise the names of
any sensitive sources. In the event information contained in
these files originates with another Agency of the Government
CIA has insisted and the staff concurs that the originating
Agency must be consulted before such information can be

’ released to the staff X(y)

, Mr. Knocke also advised that it is his understanding
that both Mr. Kelley and Mr. Colby will receive in the mail
shortly a request from the Commission to prepare a joint

‘esponse SRC the activities of foreign intelligence officials

CIA as well as the rest of the Intelligence
[ietporsn is concerned over requests received Morton

Halperin under the Freedom of Information Act. Treasury,

According to Mr. Clarke, a meeting will be convened by the
OMB involving interested parties in an effort to coordinate
response . Colby, in his role as the Director of
Central Intelligence, is very concerned that in responding

the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as
the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). In attendance were
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; Deputy AG Laurence .

The meeting was called to have all agencies identify
- (1) Types of information that could not be disclosed to Con-

gressional Committees, (2) Types of information the disclosure
of which was arguable, and (3) Types of information that could
be disclosed to Congressional Committees, The FBI was asked to
lead off the presentation. The Group was informed that we were
reluctant to discuss sensitive matters in such a large group
and we asked that the Group be reduced to a select few people
who would have to have knowledge of sensitive FBI operations.
After some discussion, the White House agreed this was a good
procedure and it now appears that Mr. Buchen of the White House,
one of his associates and probably Mr. Silberman will arrange
at some future date to discuss the sensitive type information
embraced in the above three questions. No definite date was
set for this review and presumably either Mr. Clarke's office
or Mr. Silberman will be in contact with the Bureau 49

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

this paper was on the agenda for this meeting, it was never
discussed because of the length of meeting, concluding at
approximately 8:30 p.m. Following the meeting, Assistant

Director Mintz and Mr, Cregar had a discussion with Mr. Wilderotter,.
During this discussion Mr. Mintz pointed out to Mr. Wilderotter
that it was imperative that this Executive Committee clearly .
define how réSponses~to_ the Select Committees would be coordinated
and how matters dea S dealing with policy would be clear
White House. Mr. Wilderott procedure.
All questions received by agencies of the Intelligence Community
from Select Committees would be furnished to Mr. Clarke. As a
matter of fact, Mr, Wilderotter advised 2 copy of the questions
received by the Department from the Senate Select Committee
requiring responses from the FBI had already been turned over to
Mr. Clarke by Mr. Wilderotter. Upon receipt of a copy of such
questions, Mr. Clarke would review them and attempt to identify
which questions involve policy matters of interest to the White
House, He would then inform all agencies involved in such a
response that such a question involved policy, Those agencies
would be obliged to discuss the response between themselves and.
arrive at a coordinated answer, That answer would then be
furnished to Mr. Clarke who would in turn make a decision“as to
whether it should go forward to the White House forresolution,
Answers to questions which did not involve policy matters would
also have to be furnished to Mr, Clarke to insure that there was
some coordinating mechanism in the Community and to insure that this
mechanism was in possession of all questions and all answers which
might be provided the Select ‘Committees.

Mr. Mintz made it quite clear to Mr, Wilderotter that
this was not the Bureau's understanding of how the coordination
process would work and was of the belief that no other agency
represented on the Executive Committee was aware of this procedure,
Mr. Wilderotter was asked to develop such a procedure for pre-
sentation to the Group to inure everybody was in agreement as to
how this process would work.

On the morning of 3/21/75, Mr, Clarke advised that
as a result of the meeting during the evening of 3/20/75 he was
completely confused and was at a loss as to how the coordination
process was going to work, He advised Mr. Cregar that he would

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

attempt to get some clarification and hopefully be in a
position to provide some information as to how the White House,
Mr. Silberman and Mr. Wilderotter wanted to proceed.

It is the opinion of both Mr, Mintz and Mr. Wannall
that the Bureau must immediately set up a Task Force to handle
the tremendous amount of information that will be required
from the FBI, including the coordination of our responses with
other agencies who might be involved in such an answer, as well
as to insure that both the Department of Justice and the White
House are fully informed. We can anticipate very short deadlines
and requests for information that are not readily retrievable
from Bureau records without considerable research involving
several divisions :in‘’ the Bureau,

ACTION:

the coordination of\such information responsive to the requests
we can anticipate receiving from Select Committees of the Congress.

A. RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUPPORT — athe . ae

In treating with Congressional inquiries, the Director of Central
Intelligence will provide leadership to the Intelligence Community.
The Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Community,
supported by the Intelligence Community Staff, will provide the
principal staff direction and congressional liaison for the DCI in these
matters. He will serve as a focal point for coordination among Community
entities and assure communication with the Executive Office as appropriate.
The IC Staff with the assistance of. USIB-Agencies_will provide legal, i
security, substantive, and registry support structured so as to assure conte
_. “appropriate support to the DCI and the Intelligence Community. The- -
_AD/DCI/IC will chair an Ad Hoc Coordinating Group of USIB as a
- principal mechanism for exchanging information and coordinating USIB.
activities with respect to the inquiry where ‘needed. The AD/DCI/IC and :
the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group will establish periodic and special
time sensitive reporting to Keep the DCI, the USIB principals, andinvolved ~
Executive Branch agencies advised on USIB Agencies! liaison relationships
with ae Select Committees and on substantive exchanges in response to
es. Where nsefni, enmmon standards and procedures
will be developed by the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group.

B. COORDINATION

1. Physical security is proceeding well. The Chairman of the Security
Committee of USIB has been assigned as the principal Intelligence Community
officer on physical security and clearance matters. Agreements have been
reached with the Senate Select Committee on physical security standards.
These standards have been provided to the House Select Committee Staff.
The Senate has arranged for central facilities which meet the physical
security standards and has appointed a full-time security officer who will
provide certification of personnel clearances. The House at the present
time is not planning central facilities and we understand will be dispersed
in at least three different locations.

‘Discussion of classified information will occur outside of the
security-approved Committee rooms-and particularly in the offices of the
members of the Select Committee, - Agreement has been reached that the FBI
will approach the House and Senate Staff Directors and offer technical sweep
services for the befianclininni lina offices involved.

2. Personnel security investigations on Select Committee Staff are
under way by the FBI. It is understood that upon completion of Staff
investigations, the Select Committee Chairman will certify to the DCI”

the Top Secret clearances of Committee Staff. The DCI, through his
Intelligence Community Staff, will pass along the certification to the
security elements of the respective agencies. Compartmented clearance
arrangements and certification also have been agreed with the Senate Select
Committee Staff. Similar arrangements have pert discussed with the House
Select Committee Staff. .

3. Secrecy agreements for the Senate Select Committee Staff employees
are being drafted and the AD/DCI/IC, supported by the CIA General Counsel
and the Associate Deputy Attorney General, will negotiate similar arrange-
ments with the House. The DCI policy is to insist upon secrecy agreements. .

4. Arrangements will be established by the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for the recording of documents, testimony and transcripts, and for
procedures to protect sources and methods which may be contained in the

maatoxvial owing to the Seleci Cutmmiliees fruaiall agencies. A cenirai
index service will be provided by the Intelligence Community Staff to serve
the DCI and USIB Agencies. The following describes the general content
of this central index.

a. All requests received by USIB Agencies from the Select +~
Committees.

b.. All other communications from Select Committees on subject uw
of interest to more than one agency.

ce. Reports and responses by other non-~intelligence elements of the
Executive Branch (if desired by those elements).

da. Identification of document responses provided. to-the requests _
and listing of subjects covered,

e. Prepared statements and transcripts of testimony made to.
Select Committees. | ot : -

-£. Selective material released or‘denied under the Freedom of 7
Information legislation which relates to subjects of interest to the 7
Select Committees; :

Ng 55073 Docld: 32969530 Page..19



Under this concept, all USIB Agencies would have a redereaie
responsibility to keep the central index current. Procedures will be
developed. All agencies would retain responsibility for the physical
possession and accessibility of their documents. The third agency rule
will apply in providing documents to the Select Committees.

Gc. " PROTECTION AND HANDLING OF MATERIALS Beet

1. -Itis suggested that in general there are four levels of security
applied to documents supplied to the Committees.
a. The bulk of historical data, organizational directives, budgets,
7 cash flow, command and control procedures, etc, should be made available °
‘> “=~ >> to the~Gommittees on request and transmitted by the agencies concerned °
directly to the Select Committees. This material will be under the control
of the Select Committées. It should be properly classified as appropriate
to assure downgrading under the Freedom of Information Act is consistent
with the judgment of the originating agency. The agencies will inform the
central registry of the IC Staff of such transmissions and provide a
description of the materials. The record file will be maintained by the
originating agency so that it may be retrieved if necessary for use by
‘authorized persons. F
_——

b. A second level of material will involve more sensitive data where
sanitization or compartmented arrangements may be desired. Agencies will
be responsible for these determinations. The IC Staff and the USIB Security
Committee will develop general guidelines for application of sanitization

‘procedures. Emphasis will be placed on protecting sources and methods
while providing meaningful response and documentation to the Select
Committees. The record copy of all such material will be available in the ©
originating agencies. The existence of the original file and its, saniti

ton Bnd location will be recorded with the registry. Ke

id by the agencies conc

c. Athird type of material will be made available to Select
Committee members or staff at the originating agency or if desirable at
a central point to be determined. (Facilities for a central reading room
can be established by the IC Staff, if désired. ) This material would be
provided in the presence of an authorized representative of the originating

agency. These "fondling" files may have specific limiations placed upon
them by the agencies concerned. Where such search limitations are
determined, they should be consistent with the agreements contained in the
DCI letter to Senator Ghurch or with ground rules agreed among responsible
agéncies or with the-Select Committees. The Ad Hoc Coordinating Group
provides one forum for such determinations where interagency discussions
are useful. . oe 7

ee A fourth type of material for numerous.reasons will not be aoe aan
available to Select Committee Staff in its raw form, e.g., memoranda to

-or’ from the President, especially sensitive matters where Executive Branch’

. prerogatives are involved. This material can be used to prepare briefs or
provide briefings to Select Cornmittee Staff or members bur specific
documentations normally will not be provided. If such briefs or briefings

‘do not satisfy the Select Committees, negotiations will be undertaken with
the Committees. The DCI should be kept advised‘in all such instances.
Normally, if after negotiations there is provision of raw. data, such data
Will be hand-carried to the Committees and read by the Committee or

byt memorandum of the originating agency to the DCI and recorded in the
IC registry along with the ground rules negotiated with the committees
and the agencies in their negotiations. These ground rules will normally

be an agenda item on the Ad Hoé Coordinating Group agenda.

2. Testimony given in informal interview with Select Committee Staff
will be recorded normally in a memorandum of record and filed in the agency
concerned. Employees not wishing to report such testimony are free from
@oing so. Notification will be given to the IC central index of the existence
of the file, its location and access rules. - To the degree possible, the
registry will cross-reference all materials provided the Committees and will .
prepare current reports on such materials. :

D. LEGAL SUPPORT AND QUALITY CONTROLS

1. The Intelligence Community Staff has several lawyers who will be
assigned to provide support to legal matters relating to this inquiry. The
leader of this group will be expected to have regular consultation with the

HW 55073) DocId:32989530 Page 21 : ane



General Counsels of all USIB Agencies and the Department of Justice,

the NSC, the OMB, and other Executive Branch elements involved in the
inquiry. Since the inquiry can résult in the introduction of legislation,
the; IC Staff lawyers will also provide to the DCI appropriate legal briefs
for his use. The recording of these briefs will also be made by the,
central index. The lawyers will also assist the DCI and USIB in ensuring
that the Select Committees' procedures are developed in consideration

of the legal and constitutional position of the USIB agencies and employees
thereof.

cee 2. We can anticipate the Select Committees will have 40-50 staff

| NW 55073 Docld:32989530° Page 22 — os

- personnel involved in the inquiries and that they will normally proceed

directly to the agencies concerned within their functional areas of interest.
Cross agency activity coordination and substantive comparisons will occur

within the Select Committees’ staffs.. It is in the interest of the USIB |W‘: ..

Agencies to assure equally good coordination between and among the
members and Executive Branch elements as appropriate in the material

and testimony provided and that a general quality control of the product

is exercised. The Ad Hoc Coordinating Group provides the forum for keeping
USIB Agencies informed on responses provided in the course of the inquiry
and avoiding surprise. Further, the IC Staff will establish a small quality -
control and evaluative function and be alert to the indicators available as

the investigations proceed of potential actions or further inquiries that could
derive from materials or testimony provided by the various agencies.

3. There will be a range of "skeletons" and allegations which may
surface in the course of the inquiry. USIB Agencies will seek to assure that
all the facts are found and addressed so as to be responsive to the Select
Committee inquiry and in consideration of the Administration.

E. ALLEGATIONS AND PUBLICITY

1. The nature of the investigation will undoubtedly continue to afford
considerable public discourse. Many press allegations will cause further ”
A system to chec of such allegations should be.

midnitor press allegations and discuss them with the agencies involved
as appropriate.

2. Senator Church intends to provide the press with commentary on
selective testimony or facts pertaining to the inguiry. He has advised that
he will clear with the Director these releases to avoid inadvertent disclosure
harmful to U.S, intelligence agencies. Review of such releases will be
undertaken by the IC Staff in concert with appropriate agencies.

3. In preparing statements or testimony to be given in open or closed
hearings, senior intelligence officials should-avail themselves of all
prévious related testimony or material furnished by other sources.

4, The DCI, through his IC Staff, will assure regular consultation with -
Executive Branch agencies on press matters and take steps to foster good
communication between USIB entities and political officials.

Notification of all inquiries from press officials to intelligence
agencies concemed should be provided to the IC Staff and a record of these

inquiries maintained in the central registry.

This memorandum is responsive to a request by the
Director, that is, "It appears we are gearing ourselves to
quick responses--why can't we get an agreement as to a
reasonable response time?"

Memorandum W.0O. Cregar to Mr. W.R. Wannall, dated
3/21/75, captioned as above, described in considerable detail
problems concerned with coordinating responses to the Select
Committees of Congress. One of the significant problems is
the very short deadlines we anticipate receiving from the
Select Committees.

Responsive to the Director's question, should we
get unreasonable deadlines from the Select Committees
requiring extensive file reviews, our legislative liaison
will personally contact Senator Church or Congressman Nedzi,
pointing out 2, hen, he problems attendant to the short
deadline and fgdiennbe P extension in order that we may
be completely responsive to their requests.

. This morning, in accordance with the request of the President
conveyed to me personally by him last Wednesday in New York City, I called
at the White House at 9:15 and was with the President until 10:15.

: . He. was Cesirous of discussing the ques n of the subversive
activities in the United States, particularly Fascism and Commitiisu. He
had previously received the memorandum which I had prepared covering ny

conversation with General Smedley Butler and the effort of Father Coughlin
‘to hava GeneralySutler head an expedition to Mexico. I informed the P>esidert

concerning certain recent developments in the Commmist activitics in the

country, particularly the efforts of the Bridges organization in Sen Fran-

cisco and their progressive control of the shipping on the Pacific Coast,
the Gulf Coast and their'recent expansion to shipping operations on the

September 30, 1936, they are endeavoring to have it temporarily ‘extended
umtil April 1, 1937, in order to conform to the same date that the United

_ ‘Mine Workers' contract expires, which organization is headed by John L.
Lewis. I told-bim that the Bridges organization was practicully controlled

by Communists and that the Commmists had now decided to make very definite

" plans to get control of the Lewis organization.

I called his attention to the activities of the Newspaper Guild

: headed by Heywood Broun, which has strong Commumistic leanings, and which ~

has been responsible for putting out of operation the Seattle Post Intei-"
ligencer. I told him that my information was that the Communists had plarnec
to get control of these three groups and by doing so they would be able at
any time to paralyze the’ country in that they could stop all shipping in

. and out through the Bridges organization; stop the operation of industry

through the Mining Union of Lewis; and stop publication of any newspapers
of tae country *arough the Newspaper Guild. Lo

I also related to him the activities which have recently oc-

‘curred within Governmental service inspired by Commmists, particuiarly

in some of the Departments and in the National Labor Relations Board.

i

I likewise informed him that I had received information to the
effect that the Commmist Internationale in Moscow has recently issued in-
structions for all Communists in the United States to vote for President
Roosevelt for veelection and against Governor Landon because of the fact
that Governor Landon is opposed to class warfare.

The President stated that he had been considerably concerned
about the movements of the Communists and of Fascism in the United States
and that while the Secret Service of the Treasury Department had assured
him that they had informants in every Communist group, he believed that
if that was true it was solely for the’ purpose of getting any information -
upon plots upon his life, whereas what he was interested in was obtaining
a broad picture of the genaral movement and its activities as may affect the
economic and political life of tne comiry as a whole. I told him that there
is at the present time no governmental organization which is getting eny
so-called "general intelligence information" upon this subject. He inquired
what suggestions 1 mgnt otrer relative to this matter. I told nim vaai
the appropriation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation contains a provi-
sion that it might investigate any matters referred to it by the Depsrtment
of State and that if the State Department should ask for us to conduct such
an lavestization we could to so under oy: present awynority in the t=
priation already granted. He stated that he is reluctant to have a form
request come through the State Department because of the many leaks therein, }
“but that what he would do would be to put a hand’ E :

tomorrow afternoon, and asked me to call at the White House at 1:45 p.m. i
to see him, the President, and the Secretary of State, at which time the
matter could be further discussed and an oral request could be made of ne

by the Secretary of State for investigation so as to avoid any possibility

of any leak.

He suggested that I endeavor to coordinate any investigation
_ along similar lines which might be made by the Military or Naval Intelligence
Services. He stated that the Secret Service was not being brought in on this
investigation as they should confine themselves strictly to the matter of
protecting his life and the survey which he desired to have made was on a
much broader field.

o

Today, in line with the request of the President, I called at tne
White House at 1:45 p.m., and present at the conference were the President,
the Secretary of State and wyself., The President related to the Secretary of
State his concern relative to Commthhist activities in this country, as well as

}Fascist activities. He stated that he was very desirous of having a survey

made of these conditions and informed the Secretary of State that this survey
could be made by the Department of Justice if the Secretary of State requested
the Department to conduct the inquiry, as under the Appropriation Act this
Bureau would have authority to make such investigation if asked to do so by
the Secretary of State. The President pointed out that both of these move-
ments were international in scope and that Communism particularly was directed
from Moscow, and that there had been certain indications that Oumansky, et-
tached to the Russian Soviet Embassy, was a leading figure in some of the
activities in this country, so consequently, it was a matter which fell witain
the scope of foreign affairs over which the State Department would have a right
to request an inquiry to be made. 7

matter to be handled quite confidentially and that it would be sufficient that

_the President, the Secretery of State and I should be the ones aware of this

request.

The Secretary of State asked that the investigation be made and then
made several suggestions ~ one, relative to the making of a protest, either
formally or informally, to the Russian Government relative to its interference
with affairs in this country. Discussion wes also had as to the infor

mation
obtained indicating that the Third Internationale had indicated preference for
Roosevelt as against Landon. It was the opinion of the President that some
statement should be made along this line by the Attorney General at an early
date. The President asked that I speak to the Attorney General, upon his re-
turn to the city, about this matter, and he suggested to the Secretary of

tate that he talk over the technique to a followed in this particular aspect,
with the Att torney General.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

The FBI - CIA 1966 Understanding:

Mr. Clarke advised that the Rockefeller Commission
requested a copy of the FBI - CIA Understanding of 1966 and
inquired whether one could be made available to the Commission,
I advised Mr. Clarke that we had made the 1966 Understanding
available to Congressional committees and I saw no reason why
a copy of the Understanding could not be furnished to the
Rockefeller Commission but I would have to defer to Deputy AG
Silberman (also in attendance). Mr. Silberman said by all means
we would have to respond to the Rockefeller Commission and he
authorized Clarke to furnish a copy of the Understanding to
the Rockefeller Commission.

Clearances for Staff Members of the SSC:

Attached hereto is a copy of a letter to the Staff
Director of the SSC from Mr. Clarke outlining procedures for
the certification of clearances granted to SSC staff members,
As an enclosure to this attachment is a suggested format which
the SSC could use in certifying that staff members who have
received a security ifvestigation by the FBI meet the require-
ments of Executive Order 10450 for access to classified informa-
tion up to and including "Top Secret." A second enclosure to
Clarke's letter to Miller contains a copy of Director of Central
Intelligence Directive (DCID) 1/14 which sets up the Uniform
Personnel Security Standards and Practices Governing Access to
Sensitive Compartmented Information, Clearances for access to
compartmented information are the responsibility of CIA and such
clearances will be issued to select members of the SSC on a
“need-to-know" basis.

Staff Members on Whom Substantial Derogatory Information is
Developed:

Mr. Clarke asked if I could describe for the Group
what procedures had been worked out with Senator Church when
information was developed of a significant derogatory nature
regarding potential staff employees. I advised the Group that
upon such a determination a Bureau official would bring the

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

written results of the investigation personally to the
attention of Senator Church or his Staff Director. Follow-

ing that a copy of this investigation would be made available
to Mr. Colby as the Director of Central Intelligence and that
Senator Church or the Staff Director would welcome any comments
from Mr. Colby as to the security ramifications attendant to
the employment of this person. Mr. Clarke agreed this was a
very desirable procedure and the Group fully endorsed this
arrangement.

Organization of the SSC:

Attached is Mr, Clarke's understanding of how the
SSC will be organized, It is noted it will be broken down into
fom Task Forces, each with a Task Force Director, a lawyer or
lawyers assigned, each with several researchers. As noted from
this enclosure, Task Force three concerns domestic activities
including the FBI and those parts of the CIA that relate to
domestic matters. Army counterintelligence activities may also
come under the cognizance of this Task Force. Staffing for Task
Force number three is still in. process and no Task Force Director
has yet been appointed,

CIA Secrecy Agreement and Employee Bulletin:

Attached hereto is a letter to Senator Church from
Mr. Colby designed to relieve current CIA employees from any
obligation of secrecy, It is noted all CIA employees sign a
Secrecy Agreement as a prerequisite to employment. Also attached
is a copy of an Employee Bulletin, dated 3/12/75, advising CIA
employees as to the procedures he should follow if he is selected
to be interviewed by a member of the SSC or its staff. It is to
be noted that both the Employee Bulletin and Colby's letter to
Senator Church were reviewed by the White House and the Department
of Justice.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

CIA Requirements Received from the SSC:

Attached herewith is a letter from Senator Church
to Mr. Colby enclosing the initial request for CIA documents
for transmittal to the SSC. According to Mr. Clarke, it is
his understanding that similar requests if not already received
are being prepared by the SSC for other members of the Group.

Executive Session:

At the conclusion of the formal meeting, Mr. Clarke
asked for an executive meeting to include the following persons:
Deputy AG Laurence Silberman, Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter;
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; Mr. Chamberlain,
Inspector General, CIA; Mr. Thomas Latimer, Department of Defense
and myself,

According to Mr. Clarke the purpose of this meeting
was to develop strategy as to how the Group would respond to
the anticipated requests from the SSC. Both Mr. Buchen of
the White House and Mr. Silberman,acting in his capacity as the
President's Counsel for Congressional Inquiries, insisted that
all requests as well as the responses to all such requests be
coordinated through the above Group. Much discussion was had as
to how this could be accomplished. No definitive decision was
arrived at. However, it was agreed that the CIA would prepare
@ paper outlining how they would respond to the questions that
they had already received, defining the level of response, the
area of coordination and identification of sensitive problems,
It was not quite clear to the Group as to exactly what form CIA's
paper would take. It was proposed by Mr. Buchen and agreed that
the same Executive Group would meet at CIA Headquarters on 3/19/75
to review the paper developed by CIA.

In view of the various legal questions involved and
jbecause of the direct involvement of Congressional committees,
‘the question of the Bureau's representation was discussed with
Mr, Adams, It was agreed that in addition to Mr. Cregar, the
Bureau would be represented by Assistant Director Mintz. This
proposal was discussed with Mr. Clarke and he readily agreed that
certainly Mr. Mintz' presence would be a valuable asset to the Group.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

As a result, Mr. Mintz and Mr. Cregar will attend the meeting
of the Group on Wednesday, 3/19/75, at CIA Headquarters, at
10:30 a.m.

Senator Towers had requested the Bureau to conduct
a counteraudio sweep of his personal office inasmuch as he
anticipated having sensitive conversations in his office: con-
cerning the business of the SSC. Mr. Cregar was asked to raise
the question of a counteraudio sweep during the executive session
to get an expression from the Group as to whether counteraudio
sweeps should be done. Both Mr. Silberman and Mr. Buchen felt
it was desirable to conduct such sweeps and strongly recommended
that they be done. No commitment was made as to who would do
the sweeps at the time. However, after consultation with Assistant
Directors Wannall and White, Mr. Adams and Mr. Callahan, it was
agreed that the Bureau should do the sweeps inasmuch as it was
a domestic matter. Mr. White indicated that he did have the
personnel and the equipment to conduct such sweeps. As a result
of that decision Mr. Clarke was telephonically advised that the
Bureau would conduct counteraudio sweeps of the personal offices
of both the Senate and House Select Committees providing such
was in accord with the desires of both Committees. Our Legisla-
tive Liaison is currently contacting both Senator Church and
Congressman Nedzi to confirm that both Committees desire this
counteraudio check, It is to be noted that these sweeps will not
include the outer offices of the Senators or Congressmen and will
not include the offices of the employees of both staffs.

March 12, 1975

Mr. William E. Colby

Director of Central Intelligence
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, D.C. 20505

Dear Mr. Colby:

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee To Study Governihental
Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, I want to thank
your for your letter of March 11, and the copy of the Employee Bulletin
you have issued to a11 CIA employees, As we jointly recognize, in
order for the Committee to carry out a thorough inquiry, in accordance
with the mandate contained in S. Res. 21, the Agency's full cooperation
will be necessary. Your recognition that our mandate authorizes all,
past and present, agency employees to cooperate fully, and without
impediment due to secrecy agreements, will serve to facilitate our
expeditious collection of material relative to that mandate.

I particularly appreciate your statement recognizing our security
precautions. AS you know, your staff was very helpful to the Committee's
staff in designing those preeautions.

The Staff Director and the Chief Coummsel will; under the direction
of the Committee, notify Mr. John Clarke of the members of the Committee
who have been designated to carry out studies, inquiries and investigations
required to meet the tasks specified in S. Res. 21.

It is the Committee's understanding that the members of the Committee
and designated staff will have access to any and all information which
the Committee determines is necessary for its inquiry. We recognize,
however, that the Committee inquiry may touch on sensitive areas, such
as the identity of CIA personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations
whose disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. In the event
that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive areas, which matters
we have already discussed in our meeting of February 27, we should discuss
jointly, and as you suggest quickly, what procedures might be followed
should the Committee decide it requires more information in these specific
areas.

Mr. William G. Miller

Staff Director

Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities

United States Senate

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Bill:

Following up on our brief discussion Tuesday on the clearances of
Committee Staff, I thought it might be helpful to outline a procedure
which you may consider reasonable to use.

As I understand your current ground rules, you are submitting your
staff applicants to the FBI for full field security investigation and on report
from the Bureau, under the authority of Senate Resolution 21, the Chairman .
and/or the Committee will take action to grant or deny clearance.

The next step requires a notification to the Director of Central
Intelligence of the Chairman's decision and certification of the clearances
granted. I've attached a suggested format for this which you could use.
On receipt of the certification we will advise the USIB security elements
of the people so certified.

I also promised to go over with you the range of compartmented
clearances that exist and 1 am prepared to do that when we next get
together. You will recall these are the clearances for which you will
want to determine the 'need-to-know" for selected members of your
staff. We need to establish agreed procedures here as well. Access to
this information requires that an individual meet security standards set
forth in DCID 1/14, a copy of which is attached.

I would like to suggest that you appoint a member of your staff - say,
Ben Marshall - as a focal point for handling compartmented information
access approvals and assign him the responsibility of insuring that these
security standards are met by persons selected to participate in this
(Sensitive area.

The CIA operates a Compartmented Information Branch as a service
of common concern to the intelligence community which records the names
of all individuals in the Government with access to compartmented information.
Your personnel would be similarly recorded which would considerably ease
the access certifications to all organizations for the duration of your inquiry.

As indicated, I am prepared to discuss this with you at any time.

Sincerely,

Task Force One - Foreign Intelligence

This will deal with the CIA as a line Agency and with the institution of
the Director of Central Intelligence in his responsibility under NSCID #1. ~
USIB intelligence entities, i.e., State, Treasury, AEC and the military ~

‘ establishments collecting, processing or producing foreign intelligence oa
will be reviewed in this context as well. CIA covert action is-also covered here.

They plan to begin! with basic papers being prepared on USIB agencies -
their missions, functions, organizations and general contribution so as to
provide the Committee with a "sound understanding on the role, nature,
performance and-structure of intelligence looking toward legislation.which
would address national intelligence needs, and provide adequate oversight
of national and defense intelligence entities and their relationships in .-
foreign policy iia William Bator is designated the Task Force
Director.

Task Fo¥ce Two - Military Intelligence

This Task Force will deal with the organizational entities within the
Department of Defense collecting, processing, or producing intelligence
including the DIA, the Services Agencies, and the National Security Agency, ©
the NRO, and other collection entities such as AEDS, Attaches, etc. The
interrelationships between Task Force One and Task Force Two according
to the Staff Director will be accommodated by regular communication among
the Select Committee staff and be addressed by the Committee in the broader,
context of considering possible legislation for alternative structures. The
staffing for this Task Force is still in process and no Task Force Director
has yet been appointed.

The Honorable Frank Church

Chairman

Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities

United States Senate

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This letter will confirm and reduce to writing some
of the matters agreed upon at our recent meeting.

At the outset, I should like to express my deep
personal appreciation for the candor and helpfulness of
you and Senator Tower in that meeting and for your
sensitivity to the respective responsibilities under our
Constitutional framework of the Select Committee and the
Central Intelligence Agency in the area of your review.
For my part, I should like to renew again, for myself and
the CIA, my promise of cooperation with respect to the
important work of the Select Committee. In my judgment,

a spirit of good faith and cooperative effort is not only
necessary to enable your Committee to discharge its
responsibilities fully and expeditiously, but is indeed in
the best interests of the intelligence community as well.

I am convinced that a responsible and thorough review of
U.S. intelligence activities will serve to vindicate the
CIA and enhance the public's understanding of the important
contribution that the intelligence efforts of this nation
can make toward the goal of preserving and strengthening
our democracy.

Ga-(/E 3957-7 -

a

I am particularly appreciative of your recognition
that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence
activities must receive special consideration and treatment
by the Select Committee in the course of your work. As we
discussed, such matters as the identities of our sensitive
sources, the material provided to us by cooperating foreign
intelligence services, the details of technical devices and
systems and of operational methods, the identities of certain
of our employees who could be targets of kidnapping or
assassination, the identities of American citizens and
organizations who have cooperated with U.S. intelligence, and
some additional materials the public disclosure of which would
create serious foreign policy or national security problems,
should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed from
the risk of exposure. We should also work together to protect
certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,
might impair the privacy rights of individuals. Where these
kinds of considerations are present, I anticipate that appro-
priate understandings can be arrived at to avoid the risk of
exposing such matters and at the same time to satisfy the
Select Committee's need for a full understanding of our
activities.

As I stated to you, employees of the Central Intelligence
Agency will be available to the Select Committee for staff
interviews and for testimony. As we have discussed, this
might require, in some circumstances, special arrangements to
protect the identity of particular employees whose physical
safety or future career might be placed in jeopardy by exposure.
I anticipate that suitable safeguards can be established to
avoid such dangers. I assume the Committee will make its own
arrangements with respect to ex-employees as to whom I no
longer have the authority to direct their cooperation. However,
I am available for whatever assistance I can provide in this
regard.

As you are aware, all employees of the Central Intelligence
Agency are required to sign a secrecy agreement when they enter
on duty. This is a condition of employment, and it requires
that they keep forever secret all classified information gained
during the course of their employment. The secrecy agreement
further requires that they may not disclose classified informa-
tion, either orally or by publication, without prior authoriza-
tion from the Director of Central Intelligence. Under the
secrecy agreement, an employee's obligations with respect to
the protection of classified information continue after his
employment with the CIA has been terminated.

HW 55073) DocId:32989530 Page 65



It is my desire that the secrecy agreements signed hy

our employees shall not impair the necessary work of the
Select Committee. To accomplish this, and in recognition
of the security protection contemplated by the Select
Committee, I have determined that disclosure of otherwise q
protected information to the Select Committee or its designated

<a staff members will constitute an authorized provision of infor-

mation within the meaning of the secrecy agreements. This

letter may be used to indicate such authorization for any

Agency employee or ex-employee to furnish information to

the Select Committee or appropriate staff members on matters

which would otherwise be covered by their secrecy agreement,

but which are not among the particularly sensitive matters

such as mentioned above. With respect to those particularly

sensitive matters, different procedures are obviously neces-

sary. Accordingly, where any matter included in these sensi~

tive categories would be involved in responding to the Com~

mittee, the employee should express his concern and, if

possible, propose a way of responding to the Committee witnout

exposing such sensitive details. If the Committee believes

that a disclosure of those aspects is nevertheless necessary,

the matter will be discussed between the Committee and the

Agency. I am prepared to consult with the Committee at any

time to avoid difficulties in this area and quickly determine

together the appropriate course of action to be taken.

With the good faith evident in our discussions on these
Matters, I believe that these arrangements will enable me to
discharge my responsibilities to protect intelligence sources
and methods from unauthorized disclosure, while at the same
time to provide the Select Committee with all the information
it needs to accomplish its task.

As we have agreed, it is in the national interest as well
as that of the Select Committee and the U.S. intelligence
community to ensure that your review proceed as smoothly and
as expeditiously as possible. Toward that end, I have in-
structed all CIA personnel to respond in a spirit of coopera-
tion.

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby
Director

Senate Select Committee To Review

U.S. Intelligence Activities

Senate Resolution 21 established a Select Committee of the
Senate to review U.S. intelligence activities. The Resolution calls
for a comprehensive review of the total U.S. intelligence effort
and is not restricted to the recent charges and allegations against
CIA alone. Consequently, it is likely to be far-ranging in its impact.

It is in all of our interests to see that the Select Committee
receives full understanding of our activities and their contribution
to the country as expeditiously as possible. I have every confidence
that the inquiry will be responsible, and constructive, and will pro-
duce new understanding of, and improvements in, the American
intelligence system.

It is with this conviction that I have pledged my personal coop-
eration and that of the CIA. I have advised Senators Church and Tower,
the Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman, that employees of the
CIA will be available to the Select Committee for Staff interviews and
for testimony. We are working with the Committee Staff to design
procedures to facilitate their work in examining topics of concern.

Attached to this bulletin is a letter which I have sent to Senator
Church. To facilitate the necessary work of the Committee and in
recognition of the security protection contemplated by the Committee,
Ihave determined that disclosure of otherwise protected information
to the Select Committee or its designated Staff members will constitute
authorized provision of information within the meaning of the Secrecy
Agreements signed by each CIA employee, subject to the special proce-
dures and limitations set forth in the letter regarding particularly
sensitive matters. Senator Church has agreed that reference to sensi-
tive data in any Committee report will be subject to consultation between
the Committee and the Agency.



NW 55073 DocId:32989530 Page 68

) .

The’ dooperative spirit of our relationship with the Committee
and its.Staff must at the same time take account of the rights of
Agency employees. The Committee Staff has agreed to advise
employees of their Constitutional rights at the beginning of any
interview or other appearance. me

When a current Agency employee is selected to be interviewed sea
by the Seléct Committee Staff, the Staff Director or Chief Counsel
will normally notify Mr. John M. Clarke, who is my principal
liaison with the Committee and its Staff. Mr. Clarke, in turn, will
notify the employee. The purpose of this is in no way to inhibit the
work of the Committee. It is intended to allow time for the employee
to gain general legal guidance if he wants it, and to obtain security
guidance from an appropriate senior officer.

My own belief is that after a careful review of all U.S. intelli-
gence activities, the Committee will address needed legislative
changes and will reaffirm their confidence in the importance and
contribution of U.S. intelligence programs.

REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION

TO: The Director of Central Intelligence and the Central Intelligence
Agency

FROM: The Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
. Respect to Intelligence Activities

Guidelines

1. tthe attached request 1s not intended to cell for a general file search
of the Agency. Rather it is intended to call for various significant documents
available in the upper levels of the Agency. Without foreclosing any further
file review that may seem appropriate to agency personnel familiar with agency
files, we would suggest the following offices (current: and past files) as Likely
sources for initial review:

(1) The U.S. Intelligence Board staff end 108
(44) Offices of the Director and the Deputy Director/CtA
(144) oftices of the General Counsel and Legislative Counsel/CIA
(iv) Offices of the Comptroller, Inspector General, Historical Studies, and
FinancefCIn sy:

2. The requests are addressed to the Director, ‘both in ‘nis capacity as
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and as Director of Central Intelligence
‘and Chief Executive of the United States Intelligence Board... ..-

3. Rather. then waiting until ell materials are evaluate, 4t would be helpful
if any particular group is produced when ready.

4, As previously discussed, please advise if there are categories of material
where it would be eppropriate for Committee staff members to review called for .
material on the Agency premises in order to cull out the most pertinent materials.

5. The request covers documents in the covered offices wherever originated
(including other departments or agencies). If any document refered to is believed
by the Agency to be in the possession only of another agency or department, advice
to that effect plus an indication that the Agency would not object to its being
made available to the Committee, would facilitate an expeditious inquiry.

Director Sec’y

On 2-19-75 Inspector Bowers talked with William Miller,
Staff Director of captioned Committee. Miller was asked if the Committee
had established a possible timetable concerning hearings. He stated they

are "months" away from formal hearings but that they expect to begin taking
testimony in closed sessions to "build a record" in about two weeks.
tapenade teehee eit |= Asel orntseacalch dad beeeeoaieiadicien ath aed heii ese
Miller said these sessions will be conducted by a Member of the
Committee but will basically involve questioning of various agency officials,
mot at the Director level, to provide basic information about the administrative
tructure, legal basis, objectives and mission, and budget of the various

agencies in which the Committee will have an interest. Miller was requested

give us specific notification as far in advance as possible concerning such
testimony sessions so that we would have sufficient time to prepare the necessary
material. Miller said this would be done.

7 Miller stated he would doubt that the Director would be needed
for any testimony for some time unless the Director wishes to be involved in
the early stages of providing basic information. t

|

It seems apparent that the Committee still is uncertain of its
course of action. Miller commented that the Committee will probably foll6w
much the same procedure as used in the impeachment hearings where extensive
testimony was taken in closed sessions and used by the Members and staff to
prepare for the later public hearings. It seems apparent that John Doar and his
staff who worked on the impeachment hearings will play a major role in the
Select Committee operations. Doar and a number of his former impeachment st: i?

members already are working with the Select Commiépesr ous, 2 : / 2 3. g ~ Os

To date, we have received PF ests from the Select Committ
for investigations of potential staff people in connection with the éle: dP Hiede
people by CIA following certification by the Committee. These investigations.are,
being handled by the Special Investigative Division on a two-week deadline basisayy

Reference McDermott to Jenkins memorandum of 1-31-75
recommending contact with Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho) concerning the
procedure for clearing staff personnel for captioned Committee.

Contact was made with the Senator's office on the morning of
2-6-75 to arrange an appointment. The Senator's secretary advised that his
schedule was so crowded that it would be impossible for him to discuss this
matter for several days. She said he requested that we discuss this situation with
William Miller, who the Senator intends to have head the Select Committee staff.

Miller was contacted on the morning of 2-6-75 by Inspector
Bowers, accompanied by Inspector Hotis. It was explained to him that the FBI
has no authority to issue clearances as such but that in conference with Central
Intelligence Agency officials it had been agreed that the FBI will investigate
prospective staff personnel, furnish results of the investigation to Senator Church.
as the Select Committee Chairman, and CIA will issue actual clearances based ‘¢ -’
on certification from Church. Miller agreed to this procedure. He was furnished [
a small supply of SF 86, Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position forms.
It was pointed out to him these forms should be filled out in complete detail and
furnished to us along with a current set of fingerprints. It was suggested the
applicants for these positi: ingerprinted by the Capitol Police Departye nt.

Miller stated they would need results of these investigatiouis as
soon as possible and after some discussion he agreed that a two week deadline
would be reasonable. It was suggested to him that in cases involving clerical-
type personnel that perhaps a longer deadline might be in order, and he said he
would keep this in mind. It was pointed out to Miller that results of the investigations

i ished to Senator.Church personally. He also was advised that

representatives of various intelligence agencies currently are drawing up proposed
guidelines to suggest to the Committee for use in determining whether or not an

applicant qualifies for security clearance as well as proposed guidelines to

deal with the maintenance of classified material received by the Committee. He
was told someone will be in touch with Senator Church regarding this in the near
future.

Miller stated that the Committee is going to set up offices in the
auditorium of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the same space used by the
Senate Watergate Committee. This space currently is being altered to meet
Committee requirements.

Miller stated that the Committee probably_will bring on board as staff
personnel most of the "security team” used by the House Judiciary Committée
during the impeachment hearings. He said this group has a proven track record
‘with respect to leaks of information since all leaks resulting from the impeachment
proceedings have been traced to Members following hearings rather than staff
personnel. This is the group headed by former Assistant Attorney General John
Doar, and Miller indicated Doar will play a major rele on the Senate Select
Committee staff.

Miller will furnish Bowers the completed SF 86 forms and
fingerprint cards on proposed staff personnel as soon as possible and these will

be furnished directly to Assistant Director Cleveland for handling. This matter
already has been discussed with Mr. Cleveland.

We have received the enclosed letter dated 1-29-75 from Senator

many members of the staff will not have current security clearances. He stated

Dear Mr. Kelle; he

The Senate, on January 27, Pails a Select Committee to Study |
Governmental Operations With Respect to All Intelligence Activities.
I am confident that the Federal Bureau of Investigation will make
every effort to assist the Select Committee in its work, and I look |
forward to working together with you in completing this important task.

In order to carry out the necessary tasks mandated by the vote
of the Senate, it will be necessary for Senators and designated staff
to have access to the most sensitive classified material. The Select f
Committee is now in the process of bringing together a staff to assist ¥
in carrying out its work. In this regard, it is likely that many members
of the staff who will be hired will not have current security clearances.

On behalf of the Select Committee, I would be most grateful to {
you if you could expedite, as a priority matter, clearances on designated

staff so that the work of the committee can proceed as expeditiously

Director Sec'y —

This reports information received telephonically
from Mr. Robert Gambino, Office of Security, CIA, on the Y v4
morning of 3/1/75.

According to Mr. Gambi icer employed
by CIA's Office of Security, has been
called to testify before the Rockefeller Commission on 3/3/75,

The purpose of this testimony is to discuss CIA's recruitment
of approximately 10 dissidents. The dissidents were ‘to be
infiltrated into extremist and revolutionary groups active in
the Washington, D. C., area in 1967 in order that CIA could
obtain firsthand knowledge as to whether aJFK Act 6 (1) (A)remist
or revolutionary groups were planning any physical damage
or attack on CIA installations throughout the Washington, D. C.,
area. ie
In preparation for this testimony CIA was reviewing l
all records in their Office of Security. In this connecti
they came across a note from CIA Security Officer Paul Gaynor
4 reflecting a conversation he had with myself, During that time
I had liaison responsibilities with CIA's Office of Security.
The note, signed by Paul Gaynor, read as follows: "Discussed with
Williad-O7-Crégar ; FBI, 4/4-6/67. Says go ahead ter conferring
: With Mr > William Sullivan, Assistant Director, FBI. ‘they néver
qo héard of this matter.'" Copies of this note are being furnished
sf Yo the Rockeféiler. Commission ‘contemporaneous with ‘Kuh's testimony.

see I have reviewed all possible Bureau records in an
. 7 effort to locate any memoranda that might have been prepared.

I have found no such memoranda and am inclined hat

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Although I have no specific recollection of the
conversation with Mr. Gaynor, I do have some recollection
that such a conversation did take place with him as well as
with Mr. Osborn, the Director of Security, CIA. This is
somewhat reinforced by the fact that I can recall CIA and
specifically Mr. Osborn was concerned about the security of
CIA's installations, There was considerable campus unrest
during this period of time. I can recall CIA recruiters
were attacked and beaten, As a matter of fact, I am almost
sure that CIA's recruiters were forced off campus and did
potential employees' interviews in Federal buildings.
Recognizing that both Osborn,as the Director of Security, and
CIA generally were very security conscious, I can understand
and believe it was probably likely that the Office of Security,
CIA, began to plan the security and physical protection of
all their offices throughout the U. 8. The fact is that
approximately one and one-half years after my reported con-
versation with Mr. Gaynor one of CIA's offices in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, was bombed, resulting in the now famous Keith !
decision, In the interim Martin Luther King was assassinated
4/4/68 and parts of the District were burned; Resurrection City
existed during May and June, 1968. All of these events remind
one of the situation that existed at that time and helps me at
least put into perspective why CIA's Office of Security was
concerned about the security of their installations.

Although I cannot recall the specific conversation
with Mr. Gaynor, I did periodically speak to him during my
eight-year liaison assignment. Had I received such a request
as reported on Mr. Gaynor's note, I would have discussed it with
the Assistant Director at that time. It is likely that
Mr. Sullivan who was then the Assistant Director would have
reacted as reported in Gaynor's quotation, I say this because
if the facts are true, no operational activity to collect
intelligence was envisioned. CIA merely proposed to place assets
in a position to know if any violent activity was planned against
CIA establishments and the Bureau was merely interposing no
objections to such activity on the part of CIA.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

I have attempted to reconstruct the events in
my own mind as well as to view other activities that
transpired during the approximately eight years of my
liaison assignment. In all honesty I cannot recall any
case wherein I was requested or instructed to make an
arrangement with CIA without making a specific record of
it in Bureau files.

For information and record purposes.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the

Group) held on 2/27/75 at CIA Headquarters. |

The Group is chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate
Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence, and is made
up of representatives of agencies and departments having
membership on the U.S. Intelligence Board. Its purpose is
to serve as a coordinating mechanism for future testimony
before various Congressional committees.

At the meeting of the Group on 2/27/75 several
items of interest were discussed, which items are set forth,—
hereinafter. ‘ |

Mr. Colby, in his role as Director of Central rica
Intelligence, and Mr. Clarke met with Senator Frank Church
on the morning of 2/27/75, Church advised that it is not
his intention to harass the intelligence community and he
hopes to reaffirm to both the Congress and the people of the
United States that there is a valid and critical need for
intelligence, Church is concerned that no inadvertent dis-
closures result from these hear ipgel ich could prejudice
sensitive intelligence community thi nc He assured
Mr, Colby that he would continue to cons, im on }
gonsitive matters that come before the Comfttes to/eeee -3/
such inadvertencies, Senator Church was appreciative of
the security guidelines furnished to him for the handling
of sensitive information and documents and assured Mr, Colby, = et
that the Senate Select Committee (SSC) would abide by these
guidelines, With regard to the Secrecy Agreement, which

his staff personnel complete, it is now acceptable to the
Senator. However, he does want to have the Chief CounséI“of
the SSC review the Secrecy Agreement and will probably propose
certain changes in its wording. (A Secrecy Agreenent was
developed by a subcommittee of the Group in concert with the
Justice Department.) '

Memorandum to Mr. W.R, Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Senator Church stated that it was the Committee's
intention to investigate all agencies' participation in "covert
action" with primary emphasis on CIA activities overseas.
(Roughly interpreted, this could involve the Bureau's COINTEL
Program.) The SSC hopes to avoid any confrontation with any
members of the intelligence community over the release of
sensitive documents or testimony and it is Senator Church's
intention for himand Senator John G. Tower to consult with
both the President and the Vice President to resolve this
matter. In this regard, Mr, Clarke advised members of the
Group that Deputy Attorney General Laurence H, Silberman has
been designated by the President to act-as his eounsel in~-—
deating-with~both--the--Senate~and~the-House select” committees.
Tt-is Mr. Ciarids opinion that Mr. Silberman will act in this
capacity only as long as he remains Deputy Attorney General,

It is the feeling of Senator Church at this time that
all staff employees of the SSC will be afforded "Q" clearances.
(issued by the successor to the Atomic Energy Commission.)
However, there is some question as to whether this in fact will
be true and Clarke hopes to get further clarification on this
point.

Mr. Colby advised Senator Church that CIA requires
all employees to sign a CIA secrecy agreement, It is
Mr, Colby's intention, as he did in the case of the Rockefeller
Commission, to issue an agency notice to all employees releasing
them from their obligation under the secrecy agreement in the
event an employee is called before the SSC, Additionally,
Mr. Colby intends to write a letter to the SSC advising it that
he has so relieved CIA employees from this obligation, (Attached
is a draft copy of an Agency notice circulated within CIA. Also
attached is a copy of the letter Mr. Colby forwarded to the
Honorable Nelson A, Rockefeller advising the Rockefeller Commission
that he was relieving Agency employees from any obligation under
the secrecy agreement.)

Inasmuch as the Bureau requires all employees to
complete a secrecy agreement, the Intelligence Division believes
that the Legal Counsel Division should review what action, if
any, the Bureau should take in anticipation of FBI personnel
being called to testify,

With regard to deleting the names of Agents and
confidential sources from documents furnished to the SSC,
Senator Church agreed that this would be acceptable providing
he or members of his staff could consult with officials of the
submitting agency if it was deemed necessary that the names of
Agents or sources had to be revealed,

-2- CONTINUED - OVER

NW 55073 DoclId:32989530 Page 98



Memorandum to Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

During the Colby/Church meeting, Church advised
that he anticipates asking all agencies and departments of
the intelligence community for the following three items
as their initial request: 1) Organizational charts, broken
down to a branch level, going back as far as 1947; 2) Copies
of all budgets since 1947; and 3) Documents reflecting all
cash flows since 1947.

With regard to items 2 and 3, Mr. Clarke indicated
that he will seek clarification with regard to budget and cash
flow submission and will hopefully have additional information
for members of the Group in the near future as to exactly what
the SSC desires.

During the course of the meeting of the Group,
Mr. Clarke advised that the Bureau should consider advising
Mr. Colby of any "bad apples" that are uncovered during the
Bureau's investigation of staff personnel, This was not
intended to try to eliminate a candidate as a staff employee
where there is some derogatory information but if the Bureau
develops very substantial information indicating the subject
is a definite security risk, it is conceivable that Mr. Colby
could at least discuss that individual's possible employment
with Senator Church to prevent the Committee from hiring
anyone that could later prove embarrassing to the SSC.

Prior to the adjournment of the meeting of the
Group, Mr. Clarke queried all members as to what provisions
they have mde for handling the onslaught of paper and
requests he anticipates all agencies will receive from the
ssc, As an example, CIA has had to Xerox over 15,000 pages
of CIA documents in the last ten days in response to requests
from the Rockefeller Commission. Clarke feels strongly that
each agency should develop a task force within their ranks
supplemented by stenographic personnel to prepare themselves
for what he believes will be very extensive requests from the
SSC with relatively short deadlines.

Dear Mr. Vice President:

As you are aware, all employees of the Central Intelligence
Agency are required to sign secrecy agreements when they enter on
duty. This is a condition 6f employment, and it requires that they
keep forever secret all classified information gained during the
course of their employment. The secrecy agreement further re-~
quires that they may not disclose classified information in inter-
views or by publication without prior authorization from the Director
of Central Intelligence. There is a provision in the secrecy agree-
ment that the conditions and obligations with respect to the protection”
of classified information by the agreement continue after employment
with the Agency has been terminated,

As I have stated to the Commission, I will make available any

f employee of this Agency to the Commission for staff interview and
for testimony before the Commission. This letter will serve as

' authorization for any such employees or ex-employees to furnish
information as requested by the Commission or its staff on matters
that may be classified. As has been discussed with the Commission,

: there are certain sensitive items which should receive special han-

| : dling. Such items include names of sources, specific details of

’ technical devices and systems maintained in compartmented channels
by the Agency, names of employees, names of persons who may be
targets of kidnapping or assassination by foreign intelligence organi-
zations, names of organizations cooperating with the Agency, and
detailed information which would pinpoint any of the above. Some
information might also conflict with a subject's right of privacy.

There is no purpose here to impede in any way the Commission's
investigation. Ibelieve, however, in most cases these specific
identifying names and details are not necessary for an understanding

_ of our activities. Where the Commission or the staff believes that

specific identification is necessary to the purpose of the testimony
or the staff interrogation, the matter will be discussed between the
Commission and the Agency, and I will be prepared to consult with

- you and the Commission to determine the course of action to be taken.

Where in the judgment of the employee a specific identification is
especially sensitive as outlined in this paragraph, an identity number
will be assigned pending resolution of the matter between the Com-
mission and the Agency, and in the meantime the identity will _ be
eeecs by the employee.

I appreciate the cooperation of the Commission and of Agency
employees in this regard., Iam still responsible under the statute
and as a professional for the protection of intelligence sources and
methods from unauthorized disclosure. In many situations the inad-
vertent disclosure of a name or identification could have serious
repercussions, including placing lives in jeopardy, and I cannot in
good conscience put such information at risk. .

This arrangement of course does not affect the Commission's.
procedures for advising prospective witnesses of their rights, secur-
ing waivers, nor the employee's or ex-employee's right not to answer
certain questions if they are concerned that the answers might terid
to incriminate them.

This memorandum recommends that we keep Mr. Colby
pprised, as the Director of Central Intelligence, through the

id_Hoc : Coordinating. Group on Congressional Inquiry of any Gly
an proposed or completed FBI testimony before congressional con
4 mittees when such FBI testimony impacts on other members of
the Intelligence Community, could result in other members of Ae a

the Intelligence Community being called to testify, or any
questions are asked of the FBI which are of proprietary interest
to another agency or department of the Intelligence Community.

% The Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Inquiry,

xe chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate Deputy to the Director of

7 Central Intelligence, is made up of representatives of agencies
and departments having membership on the United States Intelli-
gencé"Board (USIB). Its purpose is to serve as a coordinating
mechanism for future testimony before congressional hearings. “)

At a meeting of the USIB on 2/26/75, Chairman Colb

eee commented on the effective manner in which the Ad Hoc Group

| was functioning. However, he noted that it is imperative all

He hoped that all members will be made aware of what other members
are testifying to before a congressional committee as well as the
identity of that congressional committee. Mr. Colby noted that
it is highly likely that members of the Intelligence Community
will be called before various congressional committees other

Memo for Mr. Wannall

or inadvertency. As an example of this coordination, Mr. Colby
has furnished the Bureau and other members of the Intelligence
Community the statement he plans to make as the lead-off witness
before the Senate Select Committee (SSC). This statement has
been reviewed by the Intelligence Division and a memorandum

has been prepared which notes that there is nothing objectionable
from the Bureau's standpoint in Colby's proposed statement.

A second point Colby made at the USIB meeting was his
desire that all members understand that no agency representative
should discuss with a congressional committee information or
techniques which are of proprietary interest to another agency
without prior consultation. This is certainly a valid request
and we should concur. CAs an example, the FBI would not want
the National Security Agency to discuss with a congressional
committee FBI support of National Security Agency's TELEX effort
without first clearing with us. Likewise, the Bureau representa-
tive should not discuss National Security Agency's exploitation
of teletype traffic furnished to them by the FBI without prior

(6) coordination with NSA.) Recently a congressional committee asked
CIA for copies of any written agreements between FBI and CIA.
CIA felt they had no alternative but to provide the committee
with copies of thexRR ~ CIA, Understanding da 2/7/66. However,
before doing so CIA“did” obtain FBI approval, ~~~ "~~~ ~

ACTION:

If approved, through the Chairman of the Ad Hoc
Coordinating Group on Congressional Inquiry, representatives
of the Intelligence Division will keep Mr. Colby and the
Intelligence Community advised of any FBI testimony before
congressional committees wherein such testimony could impact
on other members of the Intelligence Community, could result
in other members of the Intelligence Community being called to

. testify, or where questions are asked which are of proprietary
interest to another’ member of the Community.

with a request to determine the make of typewriter employed in
the preparation of the memoranda and the date of introduction -
of the type styles employed. The purpose of this investigation
was to ascertain whether or not the type styles on the typewriters
used to write the memoranda were in use on the dates appearing
on the memoranda.

' «=» It was determined that the "Memorandum For Mr. Tamm

on an IBM typewriter equipped with a pica style of type which
has been in use since 1930. The typewriting comprising the

RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

Attached is a copy of the paper Colby provided to the White
House responsive to this request. It does encompass recom—
mendations of member agencies of the Group including the FBI,

At a subsequent meeting Mr. Colby had with unidentified
persons at the White House, the above list was t Colby

committee and face the possikility of a contempt citation,
(B) have the President refuse\to authorize the release of such
information, presumably through the exercise of Executive Privilege,
or (C) the President could call the majority and minority. leaders
of the congressional committéé to the White House, furnish to them
the answer to the question with the added caveat that they were

the only persons being informed of the answers and, therefore,
would be personally accountable for any leak of information.
Representatives of the White House were not very enthusiastic to
the options put forth by Mr. Colby and indicated that they would

be calling a meeting at the White House of senior officials of

the Department of Defense, Justice Department, CIA and the FBI

to review what position the Intelligence Community should take

in responding to a request for extremely sensitive and highly
classified information,

(3) Members of the Group were allowed to read an
internal memorandum from Mr, David W. Belin, Executive Director
of the Commission on CIA Activities Within the U. S. (The Rockefeller
Commission), to Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President.
This memorandum reports the results of a conversation between
Mr. Beldin and Mr. William Miller, Chief of Staff for the SSC.
The memorandum revealed that Miller believes that within two weeks
his staff will be in three-quarters gear. He plans to have a total
staff of about 40, 10 to 12 of whom will be lawyers. The initial
work of the staff will concentrate on a review of documents,
interviews, and what Miller called "depositions." Miller does not
plan to have any hearings of the SSC for several months and believes
the September deadline could not be met, rather that the investiga-
tion would take at least the rest of the year.

Memorandum for Mr, Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

Belyin's memorandum also noted that the thrust of
the SSC's investigation will include the whole range of
intelligence gathering agencies; will delve into the basic
matters of policy, including whether or not there is a need
for all of the agencies; what the results are; related public
policy matters, as well as rights of privacy.

Miller also advised Bellin that the SSC would operate
out of a room referred to as "the auditorium," which Miller
thought gave the best security. He said there would be rigid
standards imposed to seal off any leaks. These standards would
include having everything .in a central filing area with a specific
check-out system permitted to particular people so that if leaks
occurred the source of such leaks could be readily ascertained.
Xeroxing would be severely limited. In response to a question
from Bellin to Miller as to why the Senate and House did not
create a joint Senate/House committee as opposed to individual
Senate and House Select Committees, Miller advised that it was too
difficult to arrange because of matters of protocol,

It is noted that although a House Select Committee
is being formed with basically the same charter as the SSC, no
chairman of the House Select Committee has been designated and
the Group estimates that it will be a month before the House
Select Committee can get started.

furnished Miller with copies of both these items. Mr. Clark
stated that Miller was generally receptive to the proposed
guidelines and felt that they would be acceptable subject
to the approval of Senator Church. Mr. Miller _was decidedly
cool concerning the idea of staff_members ning a secrecy

Mr. Clark stated that he raised two specific questions
which Mr. Colby considers most important with regard to any _
presentation made to the Select Committee. He advised Miller. :
that the Intelligence Community would desire_to not identify
specific dgents or the details of sensitive operations which
might reveat ‘the identities of ‘Sensitive sources. Mr. Miller“
was agreeable to this and foresaw no problem with the Select
Committee accepting this proposal. Secondly, Mr. Clark
advised Mr. Miller that Mr. Colby, speaking for the Intelli-
gence Community, was opposed to having any dealings with staff
members of the various Senators and Representatives other
than those assigned to work directly under Mr. Miller as part
of the Select Committee Staff. Mr. Miller stated that this
was also acceptable to him and he assured Mr. Clark that all

During the conversation with Mr. Clark he advised
further that it is not the intention of Mr. Colby to use
as any part of the CIA's defense for alleged domestic
activities the allegation that such activities were under-
taken because the FBI had failed or was unwilling to carry
out its responsibilities in’ the domestic area. Mr. Clark
noted that he is aware that there have been references to
such a claim in the newspapers but he assured SA Schwartz
that Mr. Colby does not support this position in any way.
Mr. Clark volunteered to arrange a personal meeting between
Mr. Colby and an appropriate FBI official to discuss this
point, if the Bureau so desired.

Re: Destruction of Files and Records
Files and Communications Division

Identification Division has purge-type projects in both the criminal and
civil fingerprint files involving the destruction of certain fingerprint cards and
related name index cards, primarily duplicate-type cards on persons considered ,”
inactive because of age, =

Insofar as destruction of material by Files and Communications Division
is concerned, files, index cards, and related material over 25 years old maintained
{ at FBI Headquarters pertaining to unfounded allegations of subversive activities,
membership in subversive organizations, subversive sympathies and tendencies on
the part of individuals and organizations are approved for destruction by NARS when
investigations revealed allegations predicated upon rumor, nebulous complaints and
nonspecific allegations from which no prosecutive action occurred, Archival
authority has been obtained to destroy FBI Headquarters files in connection with
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicles cases, Selective Service Act
cases, Destruction of Aircraft or Motor Vehicles cases (provided no prosecution
results from the inquiries conducted and the case had been closed ten years);

_ and Archival authority has been obtained for destruction of
files at FBI Headquarters in unknown subject cases in which there was no criminal
prosecution (no time limit set regarding the destruction of unknown subject cases).

In addition to the above authority for the outright destruction of FBI
Headquarters records, Archival authority has also been obtained to microfilm any
closed criminal file: : He "after the case has been
closed for ten or more years. Thereafter, the paper records may be destroyed,
We currently have on hand 38, 601 index cards to be destroyed which pertain to
paper record material which has been destroyed previously under NARS regulations
and authority.

In addition, personnel files concerning employees who have been separated
more than one year are reviewed and temporary records contained therein which no
longer serve a useful purpose are purged and only those permanent records as
described in the Federal Personnel Manual are retained in the official personnel
folder.

Also files, index cards and related material, over 15 years old, maintained
at FBI Headquarters relating to laboratory examinations requested by various local,

Memo Hauer to LaPrade
Re: Destruction of Files and Records.
Files and Communications Division

state and Federal law enforcement organizations in cases other than FBI cases
wherein positive identification was not effected are also purged. These files
no longer possess sufficient reference or evidentiary value to merit retention,

Administrative and noninvestigative records maintained in the various
field offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are purged also, This material
is retained in the field offices until necessary action has been taken or it has served
its purpose.

RECOMMENDATION:

That Office of Legal Counsel prepare an appropriate reply to Senators
Mansfield and Scott to determine if their request not to destroy records and
documents was intended to include the destruction programs enumerated above.

THE ROLE OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

Counterintelligence is an integral part of our
national defense. By definition and by its very nature
counterintelligence is a defensive posture to the extent
that it reacts primarily to intelligence initiatives of
hostile intelligence services, As any good defense,
however, it cannot be static or passive. It is based
upon knowledge of this country's adversaries; it seeks
out and engages hostile agents and the intelligence
services that employ them, The national counterintelli-
gence defense, in other words, requires both. sound preven-
tive measures and an energetic and sustained counterattack,

* The purpose of defensive and aggressive counter-
intelligence is to ensure that adversaries who do not want
to risk open confrontation cannot attain the same objectives
through stealth. In more concrete terms, the purpose of
counterintelligence is to identify and EAnnkdabineteiana spies
aud their masters who serve our opponenis, :

Spycatching, by itself, is not enough, because
spies are replaceable, American counterintelligence must
also know who sent the spies and who supported and directed
their work in this country and in friendly nations, An@
beyond identifying these agent handlers--the officers of
the KGB and other such clandestine communist organizations—-
our counterintelligence must know how these people are moti-
vated, recruited, trained, structured, rewarded, and
punished. We need to know how they communicate with each
other--from New York or Washington, for example, to Moscow
or Prague, In short, we need to know everything we can
find out about them, as individuals and as organizations,
And finally, what we know must be shared appropriately with
other services equally concerned,

This need is even more acute today than in the
1950s and 1960s, We know from hard experience that the
clandestine communist services always increase the range
and the intensity of their operations during periods of
Western relaxation, when the openness and multiplicity of
exchanges provide favorable conditions and opportunities
for launching intelligence operations against our country,

SEGRET

The growth in communist-bloc intelligence
representation over the past several years, not only in
the United States but also throughout the rest of the
world, is statistically and operationally demonstrable,

For convenient reference there is attached to this paper

a fact sheet documenting this growth based on information
recorded by the CIA and FBI. In considering the number

of communist~bloc nationals posted to official establish-
ments outside their countries, it is important to recognize
that a substantial proportion of these are intelligence
officers, These officers have a primary mission to conduct
intelligence operations and official duties involved in
their cover positions, if required at all, are secondary
and serve mainly to legitimize their cover, In the Soviet
case, it is an estimate accepted by the United States
intelligence community that at least 40 per cent of the
officials are intelligence officers, Indeed, some defector
sources have estimated that 70 per cent to 80 per cent of
Soviet officials have some intelligence connection,
although this _figure includes officials _who act only in a

The most effective way to achieve the counter-
intelligence purpose is to recruit personnel from hostile
secret services, It is also the hardest of counterintelli-
gence tasks, a goal usually requiring years of close study
and meticulous planning, Even if the effort succeeds, ‘we

, cannot accept at face value what the penetration source
tells us, His reports must be most carefully crosschecked
against everything known-from all other sources, Otherwise
we may be duped by an adversary who uses "our" agent to”
tell us what he wants us to hear,

If there is‘no penetration of the adversary, or
none.at the level of seniority, all the other sources
(hostile agents whom we have detected and "doubled," inter-
cepted communications, defectors, etc.) become all the more
important, :

If counterintelligence is to identify and then
contain or control secret action directed against the
_ United States, it must be closely coordinated, The adver-
sary services do not run uncoordinated, haphazard operations

Sul 55073 DeécId:32989530 Page i53



against us, All their major programs of espionage, counter-
espionage, subversion, sabotage, deception, and disinforma~:
tion are intertwined, For example, a computer program
designed to keep track of CIA personnel at home and abroad
was planned in the Soviet Union, is maintained in
Czechoslovakia, and draws upon information from East
Germany, Hungary, and elsewhere, Another example: informa-
tion from multiple defector sources indicates.that the .
Cuban security service, the DGI, since 1968-69, has agreed
to operate against the United States and American intelli-
gence in areas where the Soviets are at an operational
disadvantage,

“ A second reason why United States counterintelli-
gence must be coordinated is the need for effective liaison
with counterintelligence services abroad, No one Western
service can cope by itself with the worldwide, centrally
directed, attack of the Soviets, the bloc (including the
Cubans), and the whole array of Communist Party auxiliaries,
A counterintelligence defense which stops at a border is
=o no defense at ail,

The work within our borders is equally essential.
to our safety, Because the United States continues to be-
the main site of hostile clandestine operations, it is
also the main site of American counterintelligence,

Both forms of counterintelligence--the security
, Of our own operations and the penetration of operations
. against us-~have to be sustained if the Director of Central
‘Intelligence is to be able to protect United States intelli-
gence methods and sources, as required by law,

as Counterintelligence has three values which flow
@ from its functions, The value of its security function is
that it prevents our adversaries from gaining information
that the United States Government does not want to make
public, Counterintelligence cannot perform this security
: role by rote and routines, And it cannot depend entirely
me upon guards, safes, and other passive measures, It must be
active to prevent the subversion of those people to whom

the United States Government. has entrusted its classified
information, Some of these persons are members in American
intelligence and counterintelligence organizations, :

It must also prevent leakage of sensitive
United States information from foreign services to whom
American secrets are necessarily confided as a matter of
common concer but which in turn have been penetrated by
enemy agents.

The value of what might be called an anticipatory
defense is not always evident because when it succeeds,
nothing happens, It is like preventive medicine, Its
value becomes dramatically clear only when it fails,

. The second value of counterintelligence is that
it provides information about hostile clandestine intentions
and capabilities, This information is the more valuable if
our adversaries do not know that we have it,

Finally, the third vaiue-of counterintelligence is
the large amount of straight intelligence obtained as a by
product by counterintelligence agents in the normal course
of their business, q

1gome specific and subsequently publicized examples of
Soviet success in the recruitment of American officials, in
most cases exposed and frustrated by the FBI, are: Nelson
Drummond (1962), Jack Dunlap (1963), William Whelan (1963),
Robert Johnson (1965), Herbert Boeckenhaupt (1966), and
Ulysis Harris (1967)..

2rhere may be cited here some of the completed counter-
intelligence cases which resulted in the identification and
suppression of high-level Soviet penetrations of Western
intelligence services and which were directly attributable
to CIA counterintelligence work: George Blake (UK - 1961),
Heinz Felfe (West Germany - 1961), Harold Adrian Russell
("Kim") Philby (UK = 1963), George Paques (France ~ 1964),
Giorgio Rinaldi Ghislieri (Italy, Spain - 1967), Yuriy
Loginov (South Africa - 1967), Nahit Imre (Turkey - 1968),
and Francis Roussilhe (France - 1969),

All United States governmental components have
some individual internal responsibility. for the security
of personnel, records, and physical facilities, Aside
from these basic security functions, the overall counter-
intelligence role in the United States Government is shared
by several specific intelligence agencies. The conduct of
counterintelligence overseas is one of CIA's original
functions flowing from the National Security Act of 1947,
as amended, and specifically spelled out and developed in
a series of National Security Council Intelligence Directives,
The FBI has the general responsibility for conduct of
counterintelligence operations within the United States
based on statutory responsibilities (enforcement of espionage,
sabotage, neutrality, registration acts, and related matters)
as well as a series of Presidential Directives and Attorney
General orders,

a

Success of United States counterintelligence is
proportionate to the extent to which it exists as an
integrated, unified concept with fullest coordination among
the separate agencies, It did not exist as such until :
World War II; and only small progress was made after that
war, despite the National Security Act of 1947, An
integrated system'first began to take shape in 1958, when
the National Security Council moved directly into the
problem, Intelligence and counterintelligence directives
which established the basic: ground rules were formulated

» and placed in effect, .As a result the United States has a
i set of counterintelligence concepts and precepts that _
organize our experience and hold us together, Throughout
the recent years interagency coordination and cooperation
have become a working reality, becoming more and more
- effective as the level of coordination continues to rise,

The effectiveness of counterintelligence also’
requires recognition of its separateness as a function, In
CIA and elsewhere, before the mid-1950s, counterintelligence
was often identified only with security and the ad hoc
exchange of limited amounts of information in liaison, It
was sometimes regarded as an adjunct to other specialities,

usually espionage, This subordination degraded the function
to its lowest level, to sueh necessary but elementary work
as nametracing and operational bookkeeping, But these

are only the elementary building blocks of the masonry of
counterintelligence, If it is restricted to nothing more
than that, American counterintelligence will inevitably
degenerate to parochialism and departmentalism, It will
not be responsive to a central and vital philosophy, It
will tend to yield the initiative to’ the adversary and to
the writing of damage reports after ‘we have been hurt
instead of seeking the adversary out and engaging him
before he can hurt us.

In summary, the value of counterintelligence as
an integral part of national defense requires a continuity
of doctrine, an organization of experience, and must be
sustained by a full-time, experienced cadre of specialists
with continuing emphasis on interagency understanding and
coordination,



FACT SHEET

COMMUNIST-BLOC INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATION

There are presently 667 intelligence and security
services operating throughout the world,

The 13 countries comprising the Soviet Union and
other communist states, including Cuba, operate 52 services
of domestic and foreign intelligence and security, Some
23 of these work outside their own frontiers, The principal
service in action throughout the world against the
United States and Americans--which our highest grade
documentary sources confirm are termed "The Main Enemy"
(Glavny Vrag)--is the Soviet State Security Service (KGB),
together.with Soviet military eaehieetreaeead the GRU, headed

by a senior KGB officer,

Soviet intelligence representation in the Free
‘World has been massively increasing for at least the past
ié years, as the following data show:

the Soviet Union and the Soviet intelligence services also

sections of and individuals in such parties--for purposes
of espionage and subversion abroad, During the period
1969-73, Soviet funding of non=bloc communist parties showed
actual and estimated annual costs to be almost $17 million,
But we do not have the quality of sources that would guarantee
this as anything but a minimal figure.

The scope of the clandestine attack upon the
United States is suggested by the number of identifiable
recruitment approaches made to Americans by Soviet, bloc,

82 per year, or better than one recruitment attempt per

now are those recruitment approaches that have been
successful and where there has been no volunteering of

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE

instances of failure or error that may have occurred in the past
be understood in context. He states we cannot operate effectively
without more precise provisions in the law to protect our secrets, (s)

Referring on page 5 specifically to the FBI, he notes that
intelligence collection on a worldwide basis contributes to our
internal security. The efforts of foreign nations to penetrate our
society and to manipulate our citizens are well documented. There
are several hundred foreign members of the KGB and intelligence
operatives in this country seeking information about the United
States and its plans and their efforts must be met by an intensive
counterintelligence effort, He states "Within the United States,
this is the function of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Abroad, it is CIA's responsibility to identify the foreign agent
before he arrives in America or to learn of the plans of foreign
groups to try to subvert our institutions. To this traditional
danger has been added a new threat of international terrorism.
CIA's foreign and the FBI's domestic intelligence activities have
collaborated to frustrate several plans to bring to America and its
citizens the kind of hijacking and indiscriminate terrorist bombings
that characterize too many areas of the world." (S)

Beginning at page 7, Mr. Colby undeatakes to explain the
processes of collecting intelligence and on page 10 briefly goes
into the roles of the various intelligence components and the
legislative bases for their activities, For example, he states
the intelligence roles of the other members of the Intelligence
Community in part stem from the 1947 Act and in part from separate
legislation, such as that charging the FBI with responsibility for
internal security, which I consider a correct statement. (S

On page 11, he notes that all intelligence elements operate
within legal authority and are given further direction by the
National Security Council, but (page 13) "each of us in the Intelli-
gence Community takes full personal responsibility for the actions
recommend: or taken in conformance with such general guidance and
policy." (S

He explains the role of the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board (PFIAB) whose "members are an impressive group of
responsible Americans who report their independent views of the
accomplishments and weaknesses of the Intelligence Community direetly
to the President." G)

Following this, he notes that in addition to responding to

Intelligence Community functions through a series of committees
and boards, Mr. Colby states that the work of such committees and
boards is limited to foreign intelligence,"as internal security
falls solely within the jurisdiction of the FBI. The FBI participates
in the Intelligence Community effort, however, so that any contribu-
tions that foreign intelligence might make to internal security can
be properly haidled." 5)

On page 17, Mr. Colby expresses confidence that the American
people not only support but insist upon an effective intelligence
apparatus to protect their security and intelligence. Thereafter,
referring to Congress, on page 17, he states "Just tell us in the
intelligence business what the Nation wants and does not want, and
we will do our best to satisfy it. But also give us a way openly
to change these rules when the Nation expects them to be changed."
He then calls upon Congress to organize itself to protect the
necessary secrecy of our intelligence operations while exercising
its responsibility for oversight. (6

A review of Mr. Colby's proposed statement has revealed
no information which I feel would be objectionable from the Bureau's
standpoint.

“Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee
This Committee's inquiry and its conclusions and recom-
: mendations can open a new era in American intelligence and
even in the intelligence profession worldwide. Historically,
the intelligence activities of a state have been considered
an essential function, but one conducted outside normal Gov-
ernment processes. Indeed, one foreign official recently
expressed some surprise to me that our intelligence rests
upon legislation enacted by the Congress and is subject to
oversight and annual appropriation by the Congress. He com-
mented that he nad aiways considered it a watter private _
the Executive. This Committee's charter demonstrates the
contrary in America. :
America has made many innovations in the intelligence
_ process, and I believe we have brought ours to the highest
peak of efficiency of any intelligence service in the world.
Our Government's policies can now be based on factual in-
formation and demonstrable analysis rather than on hunches,
circumstantial evidence, and overly qualified judgments
that alone were available a €ew Years ago.
With the assistancé of my Intelligence Community col-
leagues, I hope to give this Committee the broadest possible

look at these intelligence efforts of the United States.

I will also offer ideas for improvements that could help us
do our job”better.

It is important that our intelligence activities be
viewed in proper perspective and that the few instances of
failure or error that may have occurred in the past be
understood in context. ,

We will welcome clear statements of the authority and
mission assigned to American intelligence. I believe the
public, including those engaged in the intelligence profession,
are entitled to and are prepared to accept clarifications
and new definitions. The Congress and the American people
do not expect intelligence to ‘be carried on in the shadows
of euphemism and ambiguity. Nor can we operate effectively
without more precise provisions in the law to protect our
secrets. I believe our nation is ready to accept the nec-
essity of reasonable secrecy in our intelligence operations
in the same way it accepts the need for secrecy in ‘diplomatic
negotiations, in development of war plans, or in protecting

‘ newspaper sources. He
: I, The Importance of Intelligence

Mr. Chairman, American intelligence helps protect our
country, it helps maintain peace in the world, and it helps
our Government make better decisions affecting the welfare

of every one of our citizens. It is not only responsible

:
7 55073 DocId:32989530 Page 167



® e

for warning us of imminent attack by a hostile power, these
days it must also look into the future and warn of the research
and development of new weapons systems which, unless countered
or negotiated away, would affect the security of our citizens
ten years hence. 7 | 7
Perhaps the most dramatic example of the contribution of
intelligence to our security occurred in 1962 in the Cuban
Missile Crisis. But this story began long before in the
secret development of the U-2 aircraft to give-us access to
areas where we had always been blinded. Its flight over
Cuba on October 14, 1962, provided the first certain evidence
of the deployment of offensive missiles there, but intelligence
during that crisis involved far more than the U-2. Through
the entire apparatus of intelligence, a close watch was main-

tained over all the ways in which our national security might

‘have been jeopardized, and it was precisely this centralized

analysis of thousands of individual bits of information that
provided our Government with reasoned assessments and
estimates during the critical days of October 1962. These

assessments drew on all types of technical, diplomatic, and

military intelligence, and they were substantially assisted

by the contribution made by at. least one foreign agent who

paid for his commitment with his life.

DocId:32989530 Page 168



e .

Mr. Chairman, the Intelligence Community has not been idle
since the development of the U~2, and the improvements that
have been made have added a new dimension to the importance
of intelligence today--its contribution to the maintenance
of peace in the world. ;

As I believe is well known, the breakthrough in the Strategic
Arms Limitations negotiations followed the development of our
ability to monitor whether or not the other side is complying
with the agreements made. To do so with respect to closed and
suspicious societies, intelligence has had to invest hundreds
of millions of dollars and heavy doses of imagination and
technical genius.

We have not yet convinced all the nations that might
pose a threat to us that our system of openness is the best

for them as well as for us, so we must depend upon our intel-

ligence to give us the means with which to negotiate with

them and, at least, to limit, if not eliminate, the risks we
both run in today's world.

The peace-keeping role of intelligence goes beyond strategic
arms. There are a number of, situations in which our knowledge
of some local situation, around the world was better than that
of the participants. By bringing this knowledge to both sides,
or to ‘the one about to make a mistaken military move, intel-

ligence has several times assisted in defusing a potential

i HW 55073  DocId:32989530 Page 169 |


. HW 55073
LL

erisis and thus disproving our own predictions. This is a

contribution of which we are proud, for our purpose is not
merely to record facts pertaining to foreign situations
but to help maintain security and peace as well.

Intelligence likewise contributes to our internal secu-
rity. The efforts of foreign nations to penetrate our society
and to manipulate our citizens are well documented. There
are several hundred foreign members of the KGB and intelligence
operatives in this country seeking information about the
United States and its plans, and their efforts must be met by
&. Within the Unit
States, this is the function of the Federal Bureau of Invest-

igation. Abroad, it is CIA's responsibility to identify the

foreign agent before he arrives in America or to learn of

the plans of foreign groups to try to subvert our institutions.

To this traditional danger has been added a new threat
of international terrorism. CIA's foreign and the FBI's domestic
intelligence activities have collaborated to frustrate several
plans to bring to America and its citizens the kind of hijack-
ing and indiscriminate teriSrist bombings that characterize
too many areas of the world, Intelligence has also contributed
to the identification of international narcotics traffickers,
reducing the threat this pernicious activity poses to the

health of our citizens.

-5-

DocId:32989530 Page 170


Major political and economic decisions are regularly made
by our Government and by our Congress with assistance from our
intelligence. These decisions range from the appropriate level
of our defense budget to economic and monetary policy. In the
past several years the Intelligence Community--CIA, and parts
of State, and Treasury in particular-~has paid considerable
attention to international economics and related political
issues. The interdependence of the world with respect to energy,
food, raw. materials, and service industries is-increasing at
avery rapid rate. The accompanying shifts in economic power
and control can require future adjustments of grave importance
to our country. American intelligence keeps watch on such
foreign activities. Stated another way, it is becoming as
important to our national security to watch the machinations
of foreign cartel arrangements as to follow Soviet or Chinese
missile development. Intelligence is critical to our coun-

.
try's economic negotiations and we are contributing materially.

Mr. Chairman, I indicated at the outset the importance
of this Committee's getting a full appreciation for the con-

i tribution intelligence is making to our country. But foremost

in this process is the Intelligence Community's reputation for

objectivity in our intelligence assessments. We do not claim

that intelligence analysis provides a scientific procedure for °

reaching decisions. We do feel it provides an essential

~6- :
; ‘
u 232989530 Page 171



|
' HW 55073 DocId:32989530 Page 172

e e

“mechanism for giving visibility to the issues for the policy-

maker. Our job is to provide an independent and objective
analysis based upon a wide range of confidential sources and
technical inputs. The organization of the Intelligence Com-

munity is designed to provide this independence and objectivity.

II. The American Intelligence Process
Mx. Chairman, I would like to cover briefly the American
intelligence process, as I believe it is grossly misunderstood
by many quarters who associate it almost exclusively with the

spectacular images of James Bond, Mata Hari, or even Maxwell

th
fa

-lectual.exercise that encompasses the following steps:
1. The collection and assembly of raw informa-
tion from all sources available to the U.S. Govern-
ment, ranging from overt news dispatches to data
from the most secret technical devices or agents;

2. The assessment of the validity of the raw
information;

3. The analysis of the~information and the
development of objective conclusions and judg-
ments; and a

4 The presentation of the findings to policy

makers in a clear, succinct, and timely fashion.

-7-



e e _

The collection process involves acquiring open informa~
tion wherever this is possible. This information largely comes
from abroad but also here in the United States from knowledge-
able citizens and Government officers whose missions are well
understood and accepted in international life, such as Foreign
Service Officers, Defense, Treasury, and even Commercial and
Agricultural Attaches. To this is added the information col-
lected by technical means. Today these give us access to
areas never before seen. Electronic marvels identify details
we never hoped to know, and computers select and store masses
of detail never before manageable. These ways to collect are
supplemented by clandestine collection for those matters and
in those societies where open or technical collection cannot
provide the secret war plans, the research idea before it is
visible, or a perception of authoritarian political dynamics.

After the material is collected, it must be processed
or analyzed. Again the electronic and computer worlds have
added new dimensions to our potential to extract valuable
information from hitherto incomprehensible indicators, al-
though, alas, the computer“has also increased the incompre-

hensibility of some of the systems we try to identify.

HW 55073 DocId:32989530 Page 173 7 i


NW 55073

DocId:32989530 Page 174

The analytical process is the smallest of our categories
of expenditure, but upon the integrity, the objectivity, and
the expertise of this body of men and women rests the real
fruit of the whole process~-reasoned assessments of develop-
ments abroad today and in the future.

An essential element of the process is the presentation
of intelligence to ‘those who make the decisions for our nation.
In our society this is not restricted to the Executive but also
includes the Congress and the public. Asa consequence, intel-
ligence has endeavored to bring its product to the Congress and
even to the public through unclassified publications where
possible, through classified testimony in executive session that
is later reviewed so we can release all information that does not

reveal our sources and methods, and through informal discussion

with journalists and the academic community where conclusions

can be debated but sources omitted. ee

In addition, the Department of Defense has regularly made
available the results of the intelligence process, the best
example perhaps being the way we followed in the news media
the development and testing-of the generation of Soviet missiles

now being deployed. When such material is consciously released,

it can be done in a form that Allows the Congress and the public



to benefit from the conclusions and assessments involved but
still eoeaore the sources and methods by which we reach them.
Unfortunately, their revelation by individuals without author-
ization can result in the exposure of the source or technique
by which we learn the information. - .

Mr. Chairman, the National Security Act of 1947'was the
foundation stone for this American intelligence process. At
that time, intelligence was deemed by our country to be a mat-
ter which should be protected from public exposure. Thus,
the specifics of the intelligence process and its authorities
were deliberately expressed in general language and left by
that statute to be specified in classified directives by the
National Security Council. The CIA Act of 1949 further rec-
ognized the importance of this secrecy to intelligence and
specifically exempted the CIA from the publication of the
“organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries,
‘or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency. ;

The intelligence roles of the other members of the

Intelligence Community in part stem from the 1947 Act and

in part from separate legis ation, such as that charging the

FBI with responsibility for internal security, the AEC, now

ERDA; with its security ‘authorities, and other laws such as

Public Law 86-36, which provides the National Security

Agency the authority to function without disclosing

-10-

HW 55073

bd —

information that would endanger its cryptologic functions. All

intelligence elements operate within legal authority. All are

given further direction by the National Security Council.

Those Acts, however, were not the end of Congress' role
with respect to intelligence. Intelligence operates on an-
nual appropriations, it xeports to a variety of Congressional
committees, and the.Director and Deputy Director of Central
Intelligence are appointed with the advice and consent of the
Senate after heaxings which, in the cases of General Walters
and me, ineludea open sessions.

Congress long ago made special arrangements to handle
oversight and appropriations for intelligence. The consistent
position of the Executive Branch in this regard has been that
it would respond to any way in which the Congress organized
itself to conduct this oversight and appropriations process:
To this, as indicated earlier, I add my own concern that this
process be conducted in a manner that preserves the secrecy
upon which intelligence must rest.

In tune with the times, we have in more recent years,
and not just in my Directorship, become increasingly re-
sponsive to Congzess both in executive session and in open
session. For example, in 1974, I appeared. before thirteen

committees or subcommittees on twenty-five occasions. Mi
-ll-

. These were supplemented by informal responses or briefings to
interested members on a frequent basis. The result has been
7 greater exposure of the substance of our intelligence process
to assist Congress in its decisionmaking, as well-as a few.
untoward exposures of our sources ana methods. I hope that
this Committee sets out clearer arrangements with both houses
so that we can make available the substance of our intelligence
to assist in your decisionmaking while protecting the intel-
ligence sources and methods. ne
The Executive Branch directs and supervises the intel-
ligence apparatus to insure that onr intelligence agencies
work together for the common goal without duplication or
bureaucratic conflict. At the head of the structure is, of
course, the National Security Council, pursuant to statute.
The Council itself has issued general directives to the Intelli-
gence Community, and the subcommittees established under the
Council give more frequent guidance and direction to our effort.
Certain subcommittees focus on current crises and call for in-
telligence coverage thereof, certain work on longer term problems
that require intelligence dnalysis, and certain review the
work of the Intelligence Community in specified fields. I -

will not get into the bureaucratic detail necessary to clarify

this at this session, although I certainly expect to do so in

-12-

_ the future. I would like, however, to state my belief that

the Intelligence Community receives appropriate general guid-
ance and direction from the National Security Council and its
committees. However, the Intelligence Community itself is
vesponsible for recommending actions needed or for recommend-
ing the best way to accomplish the general goals set out by
policy leaders. Thus, general policy direction stems from
the National Security Council, but each of us in the Intelli-
gence Community takes full personal responsibility for the
actions recommended or taken in conformance with such general
guidance and policy.

An independent review of the effectiveness of our intel-

ligence effort is conducted by the President's Foreign Intel-

ligence Advisory Board. This Board over the years has had

an important role in stimulating and supporting improvements

in our intelligence machinery. Its members are an impressive

group of responsible Americans who report their independent
views of the accomplishments and the weaknesses of the Intel-
ligence Community directly to the President.

Also in the Executive. Branch, the Office of Management
and Budget conducts through a compartmented unit the same type
of budget review of the work of the Intelligence Community as

it does of any department.

-13-

DocId:32989530 Page 178



eo ®

The Intelligence Community is also subject to intensive
audit, both internally within the departments and agencies
involved, ‘and to the extent feasible by the General Accounting
Office, Even in those areas exempted by law from GAO review,

our internal procedures follow the same standards and practices

of audit and accounting that apply to the other components of the

Government. :

Lastly, consistent with the policy outlined in Section
102(e) of the National Security Act of 1947, the Director of
Central Intelligence has been charged by the President with

the Tntélligence Communiiy.

He has been directed to review all expenditures for foreign
intelligence within the Government and make an annual recom-
mendation to the President as to the appropriate level thereof.
This charge requires him to insure that the intelligence ac-—
tivities of the various departments and agencies give us the
best intelligence product at the least cost.

The Intelligence Community functions through a series of
committees and boards that bring the different agencies to-
gether. TI have submitted an annex to this presentation out~
lining these relationships. The work of these committees and
boards is limited to foreign intelligence, as internal secu-

rity falls solely within the jurisdiction of the FBI. The FBI

participates in the Intelligence Community effort, however,
so that any’ contributions that foreign intelligence might
Make to internal security can be properly handled. “Twill
not take your time here to describe all of these bureaucratic
arrangements, but I would like to stress the scope and com-
plexity of the Community so that its individual elements can
be understood.

The collection of raw information consumes the highest
percentage of the resources devoted to intelligence. Large
sums are required for the complex technical systems I mentioned
earlier. In addition, the very substantial increases in mili-
tary and civilian personnel costs over recent years have put
a large burden on our intelligence budget despite reductions in
personnel, In conformity with the Senate's vote on June 4th,

1974, I do not propose to discuss these figures publicly, but

“r do believe that you will be impressed with the way the In-
telligence Community has increased its productivity over the
years and also reduced its size and focused its effort in
order to adjust to inflation.

III. The Needs’ of Intelligence

Mr. Chairman, in recognition of the fundamental purpose
of this Select Committee, I indicated early in my statement
that I wanted to outline for you some of the ways in which our

. -15-

DocId:32989530 Page 180

i
i

+, Intelligence Community might be improved so as to open a new

HW 55073

era in American intelligence. In this context, I believe this
Committee may want to focus particularly on the role and pro-
cedures of intelligence in the future as well as in the past.
First, Mr. chairman, I believe it essential to clarify

for the Congress and the people of America, as well as the
personnel in our Trite1ligence Community, the authorities, the
limitations, and the mission of American intelligence. When
President Eisenhower assumed full responsibility for sending

a U-2 over the Soviet Union, and President Kennedy for the Bay

of Pigs, they repudiated in the name of the American people

the old concept of intelligence being disowned. I am confident

that our people not only support but insist upon an effective
intelligence apparatus to protect their security and welfare.

I believe, however, that they want the role of intelligence

clearly spelled ‘out, they want controls adequate to pre~

vent abuse, and they also want necessary secrecy protected.

In my confirmation hearing, I suggested the word "foreign"
be inserted each time the word "intelligence" appears in the
charter of the CIA, to make..crystal clear its proper function
and to end any possible “gray area" in its authority. Legisla-
tion was introduced in the last Congress that would do this
and would also clarify the proper role of the Agency within

the United States. I welcome such clarification of our authority
~16-

® ®

and any limitation on our activities desired by the people
of this country. Just tell us in the intelligence business
what the nation wants and does not want, and we will do our
best to satisfy it. But also give us a way openly to change
these rules when the nation expects them to be changed.

With respect to oversight of our activities, Mr. Chairman,
I have described the current procedures. I believe they are
sufficient on the Executive side, and I reiterate that the
organization of the Congress to pee out its responsibilities
is not a matter for my determination or recommendation. I do
honestly request and trust, however, that the Congress will
organize itself to protect the necessary secrecy of our
intelligence operations while exercising its responsibilities
“for oversight.

Lastly, I most earnestly request of the Congress some
improvement in our ability to protect the secrets necegsary
to effective intelligence operations. The spectacle that we
are presenting to the world of being unable to prevent ex-
employees from revealing their knowledge of intimate relations

with individuals and friendly intelligence services who put

their trust in us is raising a substantial question as to
our ability to obtain information from such sources in the

future. The revelation of our activities from a series of

leaks of supposedly secret testimony makes it impossible to

-17-

7 oe : A r ®

contemplate the initiation of sensitive operations today
"under procedures that require their exposure to a large num-
ber of reviewing bodies. The issue of whether we should
again adopt Secretary Stimson's view that “gentlemen do not
read each other's mail" (and that we live in a world of.
gentlemen) should be faced squarely and openly by the Con-
gress and not through irresponsible individual exposures.

: IV. Cooperation with the Committee

Mr. Chaixman, I assure you, as I did on the telephone
when you were named, of my most sincere intention to cooperate
with you and this Committee in its work. I look forward to
your; as well itt our, contribution of ideas to the shaping of
‘the new era that American intelligence san have if we do our
work well. By my presence here I indicate my intention to be
as open and public as I can be during your proceedings. There
will be, however, many matters which, I am sure you will agree,
can only be handled effectively in executive session. For this
purpose, your staffs have been given appropriate clearances by
the committee, and I urge that you take steps to insure not
only that they will abide by the Committee's cules but also that
you have the legal ability similar to the one we use for our

employees to require any later exposure of. such matters to occur

only after you have had a chance to review whether they may

improperly reveal sensitive information.

There are some matters, Mr. Chairman, which I am required
under the’ statute and as a professional to protect against any
chance of exposure. The names of our agents, the names of many
patriotic Americans who have worked with us, and the specifics

of a number of our costly and delicate technical systems are
so important, Mr. Chairman, that I believe an additional level
of secrecy is necessary to protect them. The lives of
individuals are at stake, and we cannot put them to risk.
there are. also cases where the reputations and-future prospects
of a number of patriotic Americans who have helped or con-
tributed to our intelligence process could be jeopardized if
their associations are revealed openly and then twisted in
the press through misunderstanding or by hostile opponents.
American intelligence cannot hope to have any future if it
repudiates the understanding of confidentiality upon which
" cooperation was extended to it. There are also a range of
specific methods for gathering information which needs to be
secret. Hundreds of millions of dollars in complex technical
equipment _ be made worthless if the access it provides to
foreign secrets is exposed... fae
An exposure is a one~time sensation, and American in-

telligence today is suffering internally and abroad from a

series of exposures and sensational exaggerations which have

HW 55073 DocId:32989530 Page 184



NW 55073

raised questions among many of our foreign individual and of-
ficial sources, and also among our personnel. Whether the
Intelligence Community can continue its contribution to our
nation's security and welfare and the maintenance of peace ‘in
the world will depend on our ability to conduct this review
without further exposures. Thus, I do not propose to provide
these details, but if oné becomes of particular importance

to the work of the Committee, I will certainly consult with
you and the ranking minority member to determine the best
course of action. I stress this, “Mr. Chairman, as we have

but one chance to avoid unwarranted disclosures which can ruin

-the lives or the futures of people and institutions which

put their trust in our nation through its intelligence
service. I believe that you and the Committee will want to
fulfill that trust, and that this Committee's inquiry can be
comprehensive and searching without violating it.

Mr. Chairman, I have not discussed the newspaper al-
legations that led to this Committee's formation. I have
reported fully on this to the President, to the president's
Commission, and to the Senate Appropriations and Armed
Services Committees. : I am submitting for the record of this
Committee my remarks there and am, of course, prepared to

expand on them. I believe it only appropriate here to deny

-20-

flatly, as I have already, that CIA conducted a “massive
illegal domestic intelligence operation."

I have also submitted for the record a number of annexes
to this statement, mostly in classified form, in order to set
out for the use of the Committee and its staff some further
detail about our intelligence apparatus and its work. I am,
of course, available for further questioning here today and
to cover classfied questions in Executive Session when this
may prove to be necessary. I hope that out of -the Committee's
work will come a better public understanding of the role
and functioning of American intelligence today and that the
Committee's recommendations for improvements in our authority,
procedures, and protection may indeed be looked back on in the
future as the initiation of a new era in American intelligence.

We in American intelligence are proud ‘to be of service
“to our country, and we firmly believe that the personnel of

American intelligence, and my predecessors in this post, have

served their country well over the years. We are equally con-

vinced that our intelligence profession will serve the country

well in the new era of American intelligence being launched by

this Committee.
Thank you.

Tolestighe Re. —

Senate Judiciary Committee, advised Inspector John B. Hotis

that the creation in the Senate of a Select Committee on Intelligence
Operations raises serious questions about the future of the FBI

Oversight Subcommittee. The Select Committee will make a final

revort to the Senate in September, together with recommendations

as to any new legislation that might be necessary. It is possible that
anew committee dealing solely with the intelligence community may

be created or that recommendations will be made that there be stronger ,

oversight by the parent committee. weg

Hart said that he is troubled over the mounting pressures in

[tne Congress to reduce the power and effectiveness of the Bureau.

the "right wing Republicans," he said, are attempting to capitalize on
the controversy, magne thereby to take some of the criticism away
from former Presidén Nixon. - +

He said that ores of the younger Senators hi: A
take over the oversight responsibilities on the grounds that Senators
Eastland and McClellan have been overly protective of the Bureau.
8 Ik is important, therefore, that the Oversight Subcommittee show some
a immediate activity. As soon as the confirmation hearings on Attorney

‘Of this ereat kepublic, But In recent
Weeks and in Tecent nionEHS there have
been charges and counter charges spelled
out on the front page of every newspaper:
in, this country. The matter has been
discussed over, television and radio. The
people of Americ, are.contused. They are
asking themselves, “What is actually
happening to these organizations which
are essential for the security and the sur-
vival of our great Nation?’\.....

In order,to, clear tho air, In order to
cleanse whatever abuses there have been,
in the.past, so that we can put these

can recite, onca and for’ sll; the proper
parameters within which they can func-
tion, J am afraid we will do irreparable
harm to the security and the survival of
the country unless we do this.

Tt was for that reason, Mr. President,
that Z introduced this resolution hefore

been influenced in making their judg-
ments, and these influences, I am afraid;
have come from on high, may times right
out of the Oval Room of the White
House, and sometimes from some under-
Jings at the. White House.

‘We had the instance before our com-
mittee where Ehriichman calied up the
Deputy Director of the CIA and instruct-
ed him to give disguise paraphernalia to
Mr. Hunt. The question 1s, Under whose
authority? Who was Ebrlichman?. Was it
within the purview of the statute? Was it
in conformity with the charter that es-
tablished the CIA?

‘These are questions thet have to be
resolved, because we want the CIA to
be responsive to ‘the Président of the
United States directly, and not indirect-
ly. We want him to be responsible to the
Congress that is responsible, in turn, to
tho people of this country. It is for that

+Yeason’ that this investigation is being

conducted and this resolution is before
this body.

Zt was atgued by the distinguished
Senator from Mississippi that this falls
within the purview and the jurisdiction
of his own Armed Services Committee.

jurisdiction, we also have the Foreign

I want.to find out from the author of

range of Central Intelligence Agency
activities: such as the paramilitary

T expected ‘that such resolution
would be introdyced, and Xam very, glad
that it has been introduced, ond particu-
Jarly because my friend, the Senator
fom Rhode Island, seems to be heading

Up.

Now, the point that Z am. trying to
get to is, serving on the Armed Services
Committee, there are many times-——

Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, may we
have order so that those who wish to
can sive attention to the debate?

‘The VICE PRESIDENT. Order.

Mr. GOLDWATER. There are many _
times, Mr. President, when we are con-
fronted with testimony that we do not
want to-+hear, It is of such a highly classt-
fled nature, do not think, frankly, any-
one outside of the intelligence commu-
nity should hear it,

Now, 1t is my hope and prayer that
during the conrse of this investigation,
first that @ proper committee be selected.
‘We do not want to have anyone running
for President on this committee, or any
other office. We want to have people who
_ going to he objective and hew to the,

e-

Mt. PASTORE. That is correct.

Mr. GOLDWATER. Now intelligence
4s not something that we gather on
Americans, It is something we gather on
an enemy. Intelligence is & worldwide
operation nnd, I must say, ‘we have al-
ready lost from the CIA probably the
world’s finest intelligence officer, because
he was not going to put up with what he
thought he would be subjected to in
questioning on the CTA.

*ASTORE. Will the Senator from
Arizona admit that part of that has al-
ready been accomplished by the stories
that have appeared?

Mr. GOLDWATER. I am sorry about
what happened,

Mr. PASTORE. Absolutely.

Mr. GOLDWATER, What I want to
sea prevented is a further diminution of
the infelligence forces we have had, 7

I never worked too closely with intelli-
gence but I have worked close enough
to know, though, people in these jobs
and in this field are very difficult to come
hy, they are very sensitive to exposure,
and ore very sensitive to having their
records and discussions brought out in
the press. ~

So I would hone, when the majority
leader and minority leader get together
to select this committee, that they select
a committee that will weigh alt of the
facts and be particularly careful about
what is allowed to leak, because the Wa-
tergate leaked like an old sieve, and we
sure do not want that to happen in an
area as sensitive as intelligence.

might say that we have gone through
@ lot of criticism or we have suffered
through a lot of criticism in this country
in the last several years, criticism of the
military. Who is responsible for the mili-
tary to go to Vietnam? It was not the
Pentagon; it was the President of tho
United States who was the only man who _
could do it.

Who is responsible for the CIA, FBI,
and DIA and others getting into fields
I have a feeling they did not want to
get into? ‘The President of the United
States. Now should we go that high?

‘BACKGROUND:

By letter dated 6/20/69 Tom Charles Huston, Staff
Assistant to the President, addressed a letter to the Director, FBI,
stating that the President had directed that a report on foreign
communist support of revolutionary protest movements in the
United States be prepared for his study. According to the

Huston leather, the President specifically requested that the

report draw upon all the sources available to the intelligence
community, that it be as detailed as possible, and

that the word "support" should be liberally construed

to include all activities by foreign communists designed to
encourage or assist revolutionary protest movements. in the

United States. The letter stated that on the basis of

earlier reports submitted to the President on a more limited
aspect of the problem, it was apparent “present" intelligence
collection capabilities in the area were inadequate. Huston
stated the President wanted to know what resources were currently
i targeted toward monitoring foreign communist’ support of
revolutionary youth activities in the United States, how
effective they were, what gaps existed in our (U.S.) intelligence

because of either inadequate resources or low priority of

attention and what steps could be taken, if the President

directed, .to provide the maximum possible coverage of these
activities.

The request was also sent to CIA, NSA and DIA
sceking contributions relating to this same problem.
Pursuant to the request, the FBI and CIA submitted available
information on the matter. These responses were handled
unilaterally and without coordination between CIA and FBI.

*

on 6/5/70 Director Hoover met with President Nixon
at which meeting the President appointed him as chairman of a
special intelligence committee to coordinate a more effective

intelligence-gathering function.

He also instructed that
the FBI, Central Intelligence Agency (Cia), National Secusiiy
Agency (NSA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) were to

coordinate their efforts to insure that comprehensive informa-

tion would be obtained for the President's use which would

provide him with a worldwide picture of the efforts of new left
and subversive groups in directing dissident activities in

the United States. Present at this meeting were CIA Director

Assistant to the President H. R. Haldeman; Assistant to the
President for Domestic Affairs John D. Ehrlichman and Robert 4H.
Finch, Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare.

An initial meeting of the Interagency Committee on
Intelligence (AD HOC) was held in Mr. Hoover's office on
6/8/70. this meeting was attended by Mr. Helms, Vice: Admiral
Gaylex, General Bennett and Mr. Huston, Mr. Hoover
emphasized the President's keen interest in the problem of
intelligence collection and outlined the general objectives to
which the Committee was to address itself. He instructed
that a working subcommittce be established, composed of
representatives of all ine member agencies which subcommittee
was to be headcd by FBI Assistant Director William C. Sullivan.

The first meoting of the working subcommittee was
held on 6/9/70. At this meeting Mr. Huston presented

“the subcommittee with an outline which he stated the President

desired the subcommittee to follow in preparing its report.

The outline addressed itself mainly to the purpose, procedures
and objectives of the subcommittee's review. The following
from the outline is quoted:

“PURPOSE: ;

(A) @ and assess the existing internal

threat.

(B) To evaluate the collection procedures and
techniques presently employed and to assess
their effectiveness.

(Cc) To identify gaps in our present collection efforts
‘and recommend steps to close these gaps.

OBJECTIVES:

(A)

(B)

(c)

To review current proéedures for inter-
community coordination and cooperation and
to recommend steps to improve these procedures.

To evaluate the timeliness of current intelligence
data and to recommend procedures to increase
both its timeliness and usefulness.

To assess the priorities presently attached
to domestic intelligence collection efforts and
to recommend new priorities where appropriate.

Although the sub-committee will be officially
constituted within the “framework of USIB, it
will in fact be an independent, ad hoc, intex-
agency working group with a limited mandate.

Operational details will be the responsibility
of the chairman. However, the scope and
direction of the review will be determined by
the White House member.

The sub-committee will submit its reports to the
White House and not to USIB. Report will be
due by July 1, 1970.

To insure that the President has all the options
available for consideration, the WH member may
direct detailed interrogatories to individual
agencies in order to ascertain facts relevant
to policy evaluation by the President.
Information resulting from such interrogatories
will, if the contributing agency requests, be
treated on a confidential basis and not be
considered by the sub-committtee as a whole.

Maximum coordination and cooperation within the
intelligence community. The sub-committee

may wish to consider the creation of a permanent
Domestic Intelligence Operations Board, or

some other appropriate mechanism to insure
community~wide evaluation of intelligence data.

Higher priority by all intelligence agencies
on internal security collection efforts.

Maximum use of all special investigative
techniques, including increased agent and
informant penetration by both the FBI and CIA.

A copy of the "Special Report" was delivered to Mr. Huston at
the White House on 6/26/70. The "Special Report" was divided
into three main sections: Part One, a summarized estimate of
the internal security threat; Part Two, a summary of various
operational’ limitations on certain intelligence collection
techniques with cited advantages of maintaining such restrictions
as well as the advantages of relaxing them; and Part Three,
an evaluation of interagency cooperation with suggested
measures to improve the coordination of domestic intelligence
collection.
During the first week of July, 1970, Huston sent
the "Special Report" to H. R. Haldeman with a memorandum
entitled “Operational Restraints on Intelligence Collection.”
In his memorandum Huston recommended that_the President,
from among the options discussed by the "Special Report,"
select; in most areas discussed, the options relaxing the
restraints on intelligence collection.>
On 7/14/70 Haldeman sent a memorandum to Huston
stating the President had approved Huston's recommendations
for relaxing restraints on intelligence collection and
requested a formal decision memorandum be prepared.®

the "Special Report" and had made cexgain decisions with
respect to issues raised therein. The President's decisions
called for a relaxation of certain existing restraints on
intelligence coverage including the following: NSCID-6 was
to be interpreted [to permit NSA to program for coverage the
communications of United States citizens using international
facilities; hie intelligence community was directed to intensify
electronic surveillance coverage of individuals and groups in
the United States who pose a threat to the internal security;
restrictions on legal mail coverage were to be removed and
restrictions on covert mail coverage relaxed to permit its use
on select targets of priority intelligence; restraints on the
use of surreptitious entry wexe to be removed on certain high-
priority targets; the coverage of wiolence-prone campus and

student-related groups was to be increased; [era coverage of

American students traveling or living abroad was to be increase
the restrictions on the use of military undercover agents

were to be retained; each member agency was to submit a
detailed estimate of manpower and monetary needs required to
implement the decisions; and a committee consisting of the
directors of representative agencies or appropriate alternates
was to be constituted effective 8/1/70 to provide

evaluation of domestic intelligence, prepare periodic

domestic intelligence estimates, carry out other objectives
specified in the Report and perform such other duties as

the President should from time to time assign. The Director

of the FBI was appointed to serve as*chairman of this, committee.
An attachment to the memorandum from Mr. Huston captioned
"Organization and Operations of the Interagency Group
on Domestic Intelligence and Internal Security (IAG) " set forth
specific composition, operations and duties of this new committee .®
On receipt of the letter from Mr. Huston the Director,
FBI, addressed a letter to the Attorney General dated 7/27/70
pointing out FBI objections to certaim of the decisions reported
in the Huston letter. Mr. Hoover objected to relaxation of
electronic surveillance policy, the implementation of covert mail
coverage, the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious
entry of embassies to obtain cryptographic materials, the removal
of controls and restrictions relating to the coverage of
violence-prone campus and student-related groups and the
establishment of a permanent Interagency Committee on Domestic
Intelligence. The Director stated that in the "Special Report"
he had pointed out his opposition to these aspects of the
Report and requested of the Attorney General a prompt
expression of his views concerning the matter. He noted that
no action to implement the instructions contained in Mr. Huston's
letter would be taken pending a reply from the Attorney General.
No further action to implement the Huston letter
subsequent to the 7/27/70 letter to the Attorney General was
instituted by the intelligence community. There is no indication

that the Attorney General ever responded to this communication.

JINTELLIGENCY: EVA LUATION COMMITTEE

Introduction,

Since its existence was first revealed publicly during
the height of the Senate Watergate Committee investigation in
1973, the Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC) has been the
object of suspicion and misunderstanding. Unfortunately
associated by some politicians and representatives of the
media with such things as political spying, illegal electronic
surveillance and surreptitious entry, it was nothing more than
an effort by the Exccutive Branch to better coordinate and

disseminate int received by various in-

telligence and investigative agoneide in the Federal Government.
While the fact of its existence was kept secret, which may have
contributed to the misunderstanding of its purpose and function,
the IEC was not an operational entity. That is, it did not
conduct its own investigations as did the FBI and other agencies.
Nor did it engage in surreptitious entries, wiretapping or

other similar activity. It merely received data collected

by the agencies represented on the Committee and put this
information into one comprehensive report or estimate for
dissemination to interested ‘agencies and individuals within the

Executive Branch. The Committee was staffed by career personnel



ites 8

z e
and it existed for approximately 18 months.

Origin
In November, (1970, then Attorney General John Mitchell

met with John Ehrlichman, Assistant to the President for

Domestic Affairs; Richard Kleindienst, Deputy Attorney General;

Aéministration (LERA) > Robert Mardian, Assistant Attorney

General, Internal Security Division; and a consultant from

the State of Washington, former State Judge Morell Sharp, to

discuss the need for an inter-departmental unit capable of

obtaining and evaluating intelligence infoxmation from all the

resources of the Federal Pane relating to the membership,
| Fi status and activities of militant terrorist groups operating
within the United States. The meeting took place on November 10,
i : 1970 in Mr. Mitchell's office and, according to a memorandum
dated ovenee 12, prepared by Mr. Mardian, past attempts to
elicit such cooperation from interested departments and
agencies of the Executive Branch had been unsuccessful. It
: was decided that Judge Sharp, John Dean, then Counsel to the
President, and Mr. Mardian were to contact the heads of
various agencies and explain the wishes of the President’’and

seek their advice and’ cooperation. (See Attachment 1). —°

January 11 at 9:00 a.m. (Sea Attachment 2).

Judge Sharp sttended three meetings of the IEC during

its initial stages develo: mt. He did not attend the

cing on January 25, 1971, at which time
Mr. Mardian explained his absence by stating there had been

several inquiries by the former Judge's acquaintances

in Congress which caused the Attorney General and the white
e

House to be concerned that it would be difficult to maintain
appropriate security regarding he Committee's work with
Judge sharp as its head. Mardian stated that ata meeting at
the White House on January 21, it was decided that Judge
Sharp would be removed from the Goes and assigned other
consultanc duties with the Justice Department.
Subsequent memoranda revealed that certain individuals
were designated by their respective agencies as’ representatives
on the Intelligence Evaluation Committee, and ‘by February 10,
1971 a document outlining the authority, mission, membership,
staff, procedures and functions and office space and facilities

Aaeeel nal
was drafted and presented to each of the member-representatives.

Functions and Purpose 7

According to the February 10, memorandum, the purpose of
the Intelligence Evaluation Committee was to provide intelli-
“gence éstimates to the respective Government departments and
“agencies on a need-to-know basis, in order to effectively
evaluate and anticipate problems for appropriate response to
civil disorders. In carrying out this mission, the Committee
was to have access to all pertinent intelligence in the

possession of the United States Government. The membership



i

ee eee

was to consist of representatives From the Department of’
&
Defense, Department of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, and National
Security Agency and “when necessary, representatives of other
departments and agencies designated by the Comnittee." 1/

The Committee was to be supported by a permanent staff
consisting of representatives from member departments and.
agencies and headed by an Executive Director appointed by ‘the
Committee. ‘The staff was to perform certain functions which
‘included: (1) when requested by the Committee, agency repreé~
sentatives would furnish to the staff all pertinent information
relevant to the stated request of the Committee; (2) prepare
estimates; (3) report information“gaps; (4) recommend subjects
for intelligence estimates; (5) prepare relevant studies and
tase cael (6) provide for the secrecy of the information
received and the protection of all sources of the infomation.
The Department of Justice provided necessary office space,
supplies and incidental administrative support. (See

Attachment 3).

d/ In his xeport of January 15, 1975 to the Senate Appropri-
ations Committee, Director of Central Intelligence William
E. Colby stated that the State Department was represented
on the IEC. It was not. However, at some time after its
formation, the Treasury Department appointed a representative
to the Committee.



~6- o

Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mr.
Mardian to provide staff support, but on May 17, 1971, the
Attorney General requested that the FBI provide two agents
and one secretary for the permanent working staff of Inc:

Mz. Hoover acceded to this request.
Meetings and Reports i :

John Doherty of the Department of Justice ene named a
the First Executive Director of the Intelligence Evaluation
Committee and with the approval of the Assistant Reeoeaae
General, Internal Security Division, James McGrath, a staft
attorney, was assigned as his assistant. Subsequently, Bernard
Wells, a former Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation replaced Mr. Doherty, who retired from government service,
as Executive Director in Septenber, 1971. Weekly meetings were
held with representatives of the various agencies and procedures
for agency contribution to IEC estimates or reports were
adopted. (See Attachment 4).

The first estimate a report prepared and disseminated
by the IEC was designated E~1 dated February 18, 1971 entitled
“april-~May Demonstrations" dealing with the potential for
violence during the anti-war demonstrations in Washington and
other parts of the country planned for April-May 1971. During

the period February 18, 1971 to April 30, 1973, the Committee

DoclId:32989530 Page 219



F 2am. at rteatremensetan Adin tact Rditemenannastuta anfeadlante

enue, Joo
e

produced and disseminated 31 estimates or reports dealing swith
such subjects as anti-war demonstrations, potential for vio-
lence in major cities, black power organizations, Arab
terrorist groups, prison riots, and related topics. There is
attached a complete list of all of the estimates or reports
produced and disseminated by the IEC during its existence.
(See Attachment 5). The estimates were disseminated to the

Counsel to the President; Director, Central Intelligence;

Director, National Security Agency; Director, Secret Service;

Vieeclur, Fader
Law Enforcement, Treasury Department; the Assistant Attorney
a 7

General, Internal Security Division, Department of Justice;
and the Defense Intelligence Agency. No estimates were
produced after Hue 30, 1973. A communication to all .
interested agencies dated June il, 1973 pointed out that
inasmuch as the end of the war in Vietnam had resulted in the
termination of demonstrations which carried a potential for
violence, there was no longer any useful function to be served
by the IEC and that, effective immediately, the IEC would no
longer be in existence. i|

During July, 1971, Mr. Mardian, at a meeting of the
IEC, stated that President Nixon had requested a report regard-

ing the handling of classified information, which was prompted

HW 55073 DocId:32989530 Page 220

e
by the Pentagon Papers case. Shortly thereafter, the IEC,

staff was advised that White House Staff Member Gordon Liddy
had been appointed to work with the Itc regarding its study of
the handling of classified information and by November, 1971
the IEC completed and disseminated a special report entitlea

“The Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information."

Relationship of the IEC to the "Huston Plan"

In dune 1970, , J. Edgar Hoover met with President Nixon, |
at which time Mr. Hoover was appointed Chairman of a special
committee to coordinate more effectively the intelligence-
gathering efforts of the FBI, CIA, WSA, and DIA. The head
of each of these agencies was présent at a dune 5, 1970 meet-
ing with the President, which included White House Staff
Assistant Tom C. Huston. Subsequently, a working subcommittee
headed by Assistant Director William C. Sullivan of the FBI
was formed, and at held a series of meetings beginning June 9,
1970. A final meeting held in late ‘gune 1970, a "Special
Report” was filed and approved by the head of each member
agency.

The "Special Report", which was submitted by Mr. Hoover

to the President, was divided into three sections: a summary

of the internal security threat; summarized limitations on

certain intelligence collection techniques; and, a brief
evaluation of interagency cooperation, with suggested a
to iortve the coordination of domestic intelligence collec-
tion. Mr. Hoover objected to certain options for relaxation
of restraints on intelligence gathering. Although president
Wixon at first approved the relaxation of certain restraints,
this approval was rescinded about five days later.

Inquiries by Various Conmittees of

Congress and Other Entities Into
the Operations of the TEC

Since its disclosure, the TEC las been tha target of
a number of investigations and inguicies, none of which has
revealed any illegality or impropriety. The Senate Select _
Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (Senate Water-
gate Committee) interviewed former IBC personnel in 1973, and
a member of the Committee staff was offered access to all IEC
reports and documents. The final report of the Watergate
Committee published in dune 1974 makes no reference to any
improper or illegal activity by the IEC, but devoted a section
to the Huston Plan. (See Attachment 6).

The House gudiciary Committee Investigating the rImpeach-
ment of Richard Nixon (Rodino Committee) did not see fit to

conduct any investigation of the Igc, and one may conclude that

.[NH_55073_ DocId:32989530 Page 222



and, to date, has reported no finding of impropriety or

activities or assignments." See, Hearings Before the Select

AW 55073 DocId:32989530 Page 223

it developed no information which would require scrutiny. | The

- 10 ~
o

Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights (Ervin Committee),
after submitting voluminous questionnaires to the Department of
Justice beginning in August, 1973 regarding the activities of
the former Internal Security Division, was given complete
information and access to all documents relating to the IEC
illegality.

The Watergate Special Prosecution Force has been given

complete access tc the decuments and records of the ©

and it has conducted interviews of former Committee repre-
oe

sentatives and staff with no report to the Attorney General
of any improper conduct. Moreover, the IEC will continue to_
be a target of Penta by the recently formed Select committee
to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence
Activities (Church Committee) -

In his testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee,
former Counsel to the President, John Dean, testified that

"I am unaware of the IEC ever having engaged in any illicit

States Senate, 93rd Cong., Ist Sess., at 916 (1973).

We then discussed how best to approach a solution to the problem
and it was unanimously agreed as follows:

That on or before January 6, 1971, the cperative agencies
represented would furnish to me under appropriate security
measures: (1) organizational targets and (2) intelli-

SECRET

PROCEDURES FOR THE AGENCIES CONTRIBUTION TO IEC ESTIMATES

bBo The INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC) has been
charged with the responsibility of providing intelligence
estimates to designated Government departments by effectively
evaluating and anticipating problems of civil disorder.

To evaluate a potential problem it will be necessary for

IEC to request each assisting agency to prepare an

; intelligence analysis. The analysis, in the form of

| evaluated contributions, will be forwarded to the Executive
Director of IEC. These contributions, pursuant to requirements
set forth by IEC, will become the basis for the IEC's
intelligence estimate of potential problems of civil disoraer.

2. The IEC does not desire to receive a voluminous collecticn
of intelligence data from the member agencies. The .
contribution should be an evaluation cf the particular
situation based on the data which that agency has in its
possession. The IEC Staff may issue GUIDELINES, to assist the
five agencies in the preparation of their intelligence con-~
tribution. Additionally, such GUIDELINES will be of
assistance to IEC in identifying intelligence "gaps" and

the basis for making supplemental requests to the individual
agency for further intelligence informetion.

3, The following format will be generally used by the IEC
evaluation staff in the preparation of intelligence estimates.
It would be of great assistance if the participating agencies
would follow the same format when submitting the completed |

: contribution.

i. THE HUSTON PLAN

‘The earliest evidence tlut this concept of presidential power existed
is found in a LETU top secret document entitled “Operational Restraints i
on Intelii fence Collecrion,” #* and the varicus memorandums from ‘
Tom Charles-Huston to FL R. Halder man which were first revealed by
John Dian In preparation for his testimony before the Select Cor-
peite Dew laced these papers, some of which bore the highest se-
y cla tion, in the custody of Chief Judge John Sirica of the
u Sree Court for the D) trict of eae 2 Was, fs

iso pursuant to ii
States v. Sohn ‘Doe, et al., Misc. No. 77-75, May 14, 1073.)

The committee, with the aid of various intelligence agencies, re-
viewed these Gozuments, W] hile the committee sealed s a few items there-
in, which could inv olve national security considerations, it concluded.
that these papers, for the most part, deale primarily with domestic
affairs and were unrelated to national security matters.* The papers,
as sanitized | committee, were entere.. into the committee’s record
during Dean’s testimony.?

These papers and the President's own statement of May 92 22, 1978, FEE
disclose that the President approved the use of illegal wiret»pping, il- 7
legal break-ins and illegal mail covers for domestic intellizence pur-
poses, The President 8 fully advised of the illegality of these intel-
ligence-gathering techniques prior to approving them. In the top secret
document entitled perational Restraints on Tatellizence Collection,
the recommendation for surreptitious entries (bre ins) contained
the following statement under the heading “Rationale”:

Use of this technique is Clearly iNegal. It amounts to
burglary. It is also Reky risky and could result in great em- -
barrassment if exposed. However, it is also the most é fraitfal

obtained in any other fashion.*?

On July 14, 1970, Haldeman sent a top secret memorandum to
Huston, notify: ing him of the President's approval of the use of buz-
glaries, illegal w: Fretaps 2 and illegal mail covers for domestic intelli-
gence. In the memorandum, Haldeman stated :

The recommendations you have proposed as a result of the
review, have been approved by the President. He does not,

the chairman of a group
of the Federal intelligence agencies formed to
study the peobloms of intelligence-gathering and coopér
the various intelligence agencies. In his public statement of Ma

vi 1973, President Nixon stated:

' After reconsideration, however, prompted by the opposi-
tion of Director [loover, the agencies were notified 3 days
later, on July 28, that the ‘approval } had been rescinded.

Haldeman’s testimony is to the same effect.2* Dean, however, testified
that he was not aware of any recision of approval for the plan * and
. there apparently is no written record of a recision on July 28 or any
other date. There is, however, clear evidence that, after receipt of the
decision memorandum of July 15, 1970, Mr. Hoover did present strong
objections concerning the plan to Attorney Generel Mitchell 2°
Tuston was coneetned that Hoover's objections would interfere with
the plan’s implementation, On August 5, 1970, 8 days after the Presi-
dent states he ordered recision, Huston sent Haldeman a lengthy tep
secret memorandum on the subject, “Domestic Intelligence,” which
strongly attacked Hoover's objectiéns and nade a number of recom-
mendations concerning a forthcoming meeting regarding the plan

the fact that the plan was still quite alive, but imperiled by Hoover, is
the following language in this memorandun:

“At some point, Hoover has to be told who is President. He
has become totally unreasonable and his conduct is detri-
mental to ow domestic intelligence operations... It is
important to remember that the entire intellizence community
knows that the President made a positive decision to go ahead
and Hoover has now succeeded in forcing a review. If he

merits, was a first-rate, objective job. 7

It should be noted that this memorandum indicates that the NSA,
DIA, CIA and the military services basically supported the Huston
recommendations. :

Two days later, on August 7, 1970, Huston sent a brief, confidential
memorandum to Taldeman urcins ¢ Haldeman &moet

_ Later, on September 18, 1970 (almost 2 saonths after the President

glaims the plan was rescinded), Dean sent a top secret memorandum

to the Attorney General suggesting certain procedures to “commence

our domestic intelligence operation os quickly as possible.” [emphasis

against him.

added] This memorandum specifically called for the éreation of an
Inter-Agency Domestic Intelligence Unit which had been an iniegral
part of the Huston plan, Dean's memorandum to the Attorney General
observed that Hoover was strongly opposed to the creation of such a
unit and that it was important “io bring the FBI fully on board.”
Far from indicating that the President's approval of Huston’s recom-
mendation to remove restraints on ileal intelligence-gathering had
been withdrawn, Dean, in his memorandum, suggested to the Attorney
eneral : i ‘

Thelieve we agreed that it would’be inappropriate to have
any blanket removal of restrictions: rather, the most appro-

SENSTUDY 175 is the code word for a new control file for all communications
relating to the Senate Select Committee (SSC) to conduct investigation and ao ee

conventional operations with respect to intelligence activities.

Pursuant to recommendation in ace W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall
dated 1/27/75 regarding the SSC, I attendd ‘i a meeting of the Ad Hoc Security Group
of the U. S. Intelligence Board (USIB) Security Committee at CIA Headquarters on
2/5/15. Security representatives‘from DIA, NSA and CIA were present at this meet-
ing which was concerned with proposals to protect the integrity of classified documents
which will necessarily be provided the SSC during its investigation. Results are set
forth below. ‘

possibility that each agency could provide such service. It might be necessary,
however, to provide escort service in the event outside transcribers are utilized.
This would entail security of carbons, waste and notes and return of the transcribed
testimony to the Committee upon completion. it was also suggested that a security
officer be appointed by the SSC who would be a central contact for representatives

of agencies falling within the purview of the SSC investigation. Attached material
was reviewed by Legal Counsel Division by Inspector J. E. Herington who concurred
with the exception of item number 4 of the proposed guidelines dealing with counter-
me.a.sures of inspections to preclude, ". . . surreptitious use of transmitters and/or
unauthorized recording devices similar to the device located in the Rayburn House
Office Building on 12 February 1973.'' He noted this wording could be construed

as placing a limitation on what type of device could be prohibited and suggested
revising the above phraseology by placing a period after "recording devices" and
then stating, "It is noted such a device was located inthe..."

OBSERVATIONS:

At this time it is unknown if the above-mentioned material will be accepted
by the SSC or whether the committee will draw up its own procedures. In any
event, the material to be presented will at least serve as a means of calling the
Senators' attention to the many faceted program involved in the protection of
classified information. It is felt concurrence with the attached material with the
suggested observation of the Legal Counsel Division be accepted is to our best
interest.

ACTION:

It is recommended Section Chief W. O. Cregar offer the revision referred
to above at the meeting on 2/7/75 and be authorized to offer FBI concurrence with

that in some instances testimony be "off-the-record" and

that certain testimony be heard only by members and in

some cases only by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

(b) Witnesses be afforded an opportunity to review

and comment on and/or correct the record of their testimony

prior to any publication of it. ,

community. to decline to testify concerning matters within

the proprietary purview of another community member.

_2. It would also be desirable if the DCI could secure agreement

with the Chairmen of the Select Committees that those agencies

Mee ting of 1/24/75," recommended that Section Chief Wiliam /o.

FBI to coordinate matters dealing with the ‘Senate Select
Committee (SSC). The maridate of the SSC iS~to examine the
extent of overt and covert intelligence activities in the U.S.
and abroad...

On the morning of 1/27/75 Mr. John Clarke, Deputy
Director of the Intelligence Community Staff, advised that
Mr. Colby believes it is necessary for security representatives
of FBI, CIA and National Security Agency (NSA), to meétin
order to develop recommendations for the SSC as to how documents
and testimony furnished to the SSC will be protected against
unauthorized disclosure, In this regard, Mr. Donald E. Moore,

OBSERVATIONS: RECLiL

According to the Senate resoluti%a fa.d f PR,
relating to the investigation and study of A aa
tions with respect to intelligence activities, the SSC is going

to involve all agencies of the Intelligence Community. In
anticipation that Bureau representatives will be called to testify
and asked to supply some extremely sensitive documents regarding
our investigative activity in the U. S., it is believed essential
that we have an input into how such documents and testimony are
going to be handled by staff personnel of the Committee. Unless
we participate in developing security standards, we may find that
sensitive documents and testimony that we are called to provide
to the Committee cannot be adequately protected from public

extent of overt and covert intelligence activities in the \

U. S. and abroad. Colby advised that the SSC would involve rl
all member agencies and departments of the intelligence S
community and for that reason he believed the members of the

intelligence community should stay in close communication.

As a result of the above, Colby has selected
Mr, John Clarke, Deputy Director of the Intelligence Community
Staff, to act as a coordinator for the intelligence community
to insure close coordination, He requested that all agencies
and departments represented on USIB designate one individual
in their agency as Clark?’s point of contact.to insyire the
close coordination Colby feels will be necessary during future
appearances before the SSC. The Intelligence Division believes
this is a desirable procedure and recommends that Section Chief
William 0, Cregar who is the Bureau's alternate member on USIB
be designated as the Bureau representative to maintain liaison ‘

with Mr. Clarke, +1 6.

In addition, Colby advised that in his opening

for the intelligence community. He proposes to show the value
and importance intelligence has played in the past as well as
the future;:he expects to outline for the SSC how the intelli-
gence business is run and organized, In addition, he proposes
in his opening statement to make an appeal for legislation to

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE
BOARD (USIB)
MEETING OF 1/24/75

Colby advised that any examples member agencies
or departments could provide CIA wherein the acquisition of
intelligence proved useful to the development of U. S.
policies or programs would certainly be appreciated. Colby
stated that in this regard Mr. John Clarke as the over-all
coordinator would be in touch with the designated representa-
tives of USIB departments or agencies to further clarify this
point,

With regard to the BRC chaired by Vice President
Rockefeller, Colby advised that CIA has already obtained an
agreement from that Commission that any documents furnished
to the Commission by CIA would have the names of CIA employees
and/or CIA sources deleted from the document. The purpose of
this deletion was to avoid such names from appearing in press
releases. Colby also hopes to obtain the same agreement from
the SSC.

The Intelligence Division believes that the Bureau
should also attempt to obtain such an agreement from the
BRC and the SSC if at some time FBI representatives are called
to testify or are called to produce FBI documents. This matter
has been discussed with the Office of Legal Counsel and it
coneurs in this recommendation,

ACTION:

(1) If approved, Section Chief William 0. Cregar's
name will be provided to Mr, Clarke as his point of contact
within the FBI.

ee

(2) Should Bureau representatives be called to testify
before the BRC or the SSC an agreement be obtained to delete any
names of FBI employees and/or sources with the understanding that
the identities could be made available to either the Commission or
Committee if either felt such names were absolutely necessary.

This memorandum recommends that Mr. Colby, in
his role as the Director of Central Intelligence, be furnished
two write-ups for inclusion as annexes in a briefing book he ¢y~%
plans to provide the Select Committee of the Senate (SCS) on a
the occasion of his appearance as the lead-off witness before
this Committee. The write-ups are: (1) the role of counter-
ayer eenee and (2) the origin and disposition of the "Huston
Plan."

A previous memorandum was approved that Section Chief
William 0. Cregar be designated as the point of contact within
the FBI to coordinate matters dealing with future testimony -
before the SCS. Mr. John Clarke, Associate Deputy to the
Director of Central Intelligence, has been designated as the
coordinator for the Intelligence Community. The points of
tact under Mr. Clarke's auspices have been given the tithe
d Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional Inquiry.

On 1/31/75 Clarke held a second meeting of this Group
wherein he reiterated that it was Mr. Colby's intention to make
Ja very ‘strong plea for the Intelligence Community as the lead-
off witness, In addition, Mr. Colby plans to provide to the
SCS a series of annexes, some of which will be classified, which
will address some of the issues to be looked into by the SCS.
Those issues have been generally identified in Senate Resolution
Number 21, dated 1/21/75. Representatives at Mr. Clarke's
meeting were asked to prepare certain of these annexes. The
FBI was requested to prepare the annex on the role of counter-
intelligence as well as the aeetit the origin and disposition

of the "Huston Plan.” bal A 3 I3--b

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE
62-116395

With regard to the origin and disposition of the "Huston Plan,"
we anticipate having an initial paper ready for discussion
with representatives of the National Security Agency (NSA),

CIA and the Department of Justice by Wednesday, 2/5/75. This
coordination is necessary inasmuch as both CIA and NSA were
actively involved in the development of the Plan. The
Department's participation is necessary inasmuch as the Intel-
ligence Evaluation Committee (IEC), chaired by the Department,
evolved from one of the recommendations set out in the "Huston
Plan.” Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Deputy Attorney General,
is a member of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional
Inquiry and is preparing an input to the "Huston Plan" annex,
which input will describe the origin, function and disposition
of the IEC.

Prior to releasing these two annexes for Mr. Colby's
use, they will be submitted to the Director for his approval,

Vith regard to legislation proposed by the PBI,

-: a letter was sent to the Office of Legislative Affairs,

z Department sf Justice, on August 29, 1974, strongly
recommending that consideration be given to a legislative
proposal that would authorize the Governnent to conduct

court-approved electronic surveillances in domestic security
cases. This recommendation was based on the Supreme Court
decision which held that electronic surveillances conducted
solely within the discretion of the Executive violated the
warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment and our opinion
that the current standards imposed by Title III of the

Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1970 would be

v ineffective techniques in domestic intelligence investigations. --

& sponsor of the bill it has a particular interest in its

colored with the offerts of their services to prevent

by hostile intelligence against the afercmontioned defector
who was residing in the United States. The PBI determined
that tho hostile service had recruited two individuals
duving visits by them to thely foreign houeland and agsisned
then to locate and photograph the defector. The innipraats
confessed their assiganonts against the defoetor and a stem
warning was issued by the Departnent of State to the offending
nation that such incidents would not be tolerated in the Zaturo.(S)

” SENATE SELECT COMMETTED,
TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND STUDY OF
GOVERNENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Inasmuch as the captioned Committee, to be referred
to hereinafter as the SEC, will, of necessity, be concerned
ain part with highly censitive information relating to
national security, this Bureau suggests that agreement of
the SSC be sought for the adoption of the following security
measures and procedures, both in the interests of national
security aid of protection of privacy of individuals:

fn the resolution establishing the SSC it was
established that no employee of the SEC or person performing
tasks for the SSC on a contractual basis should be given
access to classified material unless appropriately cleared for
aceess to such material by the SSC. It was indicated that
the type of clearance would be commensurate with the type
of information to be nade available te such persons under
gonditions agreed upon by the SSC. In this regard it would
be desirable for the SSC to stipulate that ao staff nenber
who is to be given access to any raterial, testimony, or
ainforratien received or generated by the committee other than
that which is, in essence, public informtion be granted such
aceess without prior receipt of a security clearance based on
a full field investigation. Consideration might also be given
by the SSC to assuring itself that its members are appropriately
cleared to receive ail material to which they may have access.

The SSC should adopt rules to insure that the
secrecy of any sensitive information received or goneraicd
by it be preserved and that these rules be made known to the
—dundividuals and agencies who will be called upon to present
testimony or materiois.,

TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND STUDY OF

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.

There have been public charges that the FBI has
operated for 50 years without oversight or any external
controls. This is not accurate. In the Congress, several
bodies have had jurisdiction over matters affecting FRI
prograus and activities. These include the Appropriations
Committees of both Houses, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee
on Constitutional Rights and on Administrative Practice and
Procedure, a special Senate Foreign Relations Subconnittee
on Surveillances, the Mouse Judiciary Comittee, the former
House Committee on Internal Security, the Government Operations
Committees of both the House and Senate and the Senate Sub=
committee on FRI Oversight.

During 1972 the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board, with the full cooperation of the FBI, con»
ducted detailed and extensive examination of the FEI's activities
as a nmenber of the United States intelligence community.

The Voreign Relations Authorization Act of 1972
eveated a Commission on the Organization of the Governnent for
the Conduct of Foreign Policy, That committee madé inquiries
of nenkers of the intelligence community regarding the role
of intelligence as it affects the conduct of our foreign policy.
In its research the committee looked into certain pertinent
FBI activities and had contact with PBI representatives both
in the United States and abroad.

By direction of Chairnan Peter Rodino and the House
of Representatives' Judiciary Committee, the General Accounting
O2fice (GAO) is currently reviewing the domestic intelligence
operations of the TBI, concentrating on policies, prograns,
procedures and case management.

On 1/21/75 the U. S. Senate reported Senate
Resolution 21 to establish captioned committee. The a
Committee will look into operations of members of the
U. S. intelligence community including the FBI. The Committe
is being chaired by Senator Frank Church of Idaho. We have
already received and responded to requests from the Ad Hoc
Coordinating Group for Congressional Inquiry for information
to be used by Mr. William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence,
in preparing for his anticipated initial appearance before the
committee, The Ad Hoc Group is composed of representatives of
U. S. Intelligence Board member agencies and departments to
deal with "SENSTUDY 75."

For administrative convenience, as well as economy,
it is suggested that copies of all communications and material
dealing with the activities of the committee be placed in a
new control file, 62~-116395, and that the code word "SENSTUDY 75"
be adopted as a brief title for internal communications
relating to this matter, FBIHQ indices contain no references
to that code word.

This is to confirm a conversation ketweon you and] Deputy
, Associate Director Adams on January 23, 1975, wherein you authorized
the FSI to honor name check requests on staff employees received
from the Select Senate Committee to Investigate Intelligence Agencies,
You were advised that we presontly have a request in this connection
from Senator Howard H. Baker, Jv., for name checks on four a

staff exaployees.
Senator Baker had also indicated to the FSI that he had no
idea as to who would have the responsibility of conducting the background
J investigations which must be conducted, and this is to contirm your
approval that wo contact Director William &. Colby of the Central
1 intelligences Agency regarding their desires in this matter since they
| normally handle backsround cheeks of staff employees of committees
receiving sensitive information concerning Central intelligence Agency
and the FBE normally handles such background investigations on staff
employees of committees receiving sensitive FEI information, Following
discussions with Mir. Colby, contact will be had with the Chairman of the
L Select Senate Committees. in order to ascertain which agency should conduct
the required nae ; Anvestigations,
