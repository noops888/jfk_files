SUBJECT : Meeting with HSCA on Mexican Interviews

Nites, daddy Hawkins a

and Cornwell at 0730 saturday morning.

purpose was to discuss activity in Mexico City planned by

HSCA.

2. As usual, it is difficult to plan how to approach

questions as limited information

Is provided by the ASCA

people.

They had told us of their interest in ten persons

in Mexico City.

A quick check of Agency records had broken

them out into separate groups and in the discussion with

the HSCA representatives, one of these groups was subject

to yet further distinctions.

3. The first group consisted of the following:

a.

Calvillo - An unwitting co-optee, it

had been agreed previously that Calvillo would not

be asked

about the activity he engaged in that,

unknown

to him, was at CIA initiative.

b.

A former contract agent

of CIA.

He IS a tormer employee--as distinguished

from "agent" in the full sense of the word--and

could be interviewed as a former employee.

c. Two men by the names of Palomares and

Flores, neither of whom has had an operational

association with the Agency.

The second group is more complex, consisting of

persons in whom the HSCA would be interested because of

their private activities without reference to Agency

connections, which all of them had. HSCA has spoken

other persons in Mexico City, and had independent informa-

tion about them of interest to their investigation; they

(HSCA) felt they could simply approach them directly with-

out reference to any Agency association. They are as

follows:

a.

The two who worked for CIA, LIONION and

pperated photographic surveillance

Posts. It was agreed

that arrangements would be

made whereby they could be interviewed by an

electronic means, in adjoining but separated

rooms.

One of them may not be available as he

may be in Spain.

b. Two persons who reside in Mexico City,

who formerlv were emplovees in the Cuban Embassy,

These would be

IntervIewed as nolA nad done with other former

employees of the Cuban Embassy, to ascertain

what, it anything, came to their attention about

Cuban

attitudes towards and reaction to the

assassination of President Kennedy, etc.

It

so happens, both were penetrations of the Cuban

Embassy.

Again, HSCA people took the position

they would

not mention any possible Agency

connection or activity.

They declined to have

these persons interviewed under the same arrange-

ments that would be

used with

two support agents,

whose only interest is that they worked

for CIA.

(believedito be citizens,

Mrs. June Cobb Sharp

in Mexico City)

and a Mr. Wichtrich.

Both are private citizens who are reported to have

on of e cerest

information of interest to the HSCA, in their

private capacity. HSCA proposes to interview

these persons just as they did the two penetration

agents, without any mention of CIA.

5.

In essence, we have an anomaly, whereby we have

arranged to have support agents (whose only interest to

HSCA is their work for the Agency) interviewed by tele-

phonic equipment

Two agents whose nature is ordinarily

even

more sensitive (penetration agents)

are being

interviewed directly

because they worked in a hostile

diplomatic installation (and not because

they worked for

CIA) with no reference to be made to their association

with CIA (HSCA declining to include them in the arrangement

for the first two agents above). And two U.S. citizens whose

work with CIA is of no interest to HSCA (although the reasons

for interviewing them were not

revealed to us) will be inter-

without reference to their CIA connection. In the

eyes of HSCA, while they recognize a proprietary relation-

ship on the part of CIA with the two support agents (operated

photographic surveillance posts), they do not recognize such

as HSCA would have inter-

viewed them anyway for unrelated reasons (i.e., unrelated

to CIA connections).

While HSCA has had to postpone their trip until

around 7 August (the Mexican Government requested a delay),

the basic problem remains.

There is more time to get

some feel for what is involved, but in essence, it is the

position of HSCA that since they would have interviewed

the four persons without reference to a CIA connection)

they will

do so anyway, but have solemnly undertaken to

not raise any question

about ClA connections or activities.
