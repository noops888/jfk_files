PCI DOMINICK S, BUCCERI advised SA

JOSEPE M. NYERS that he had been in the Surfside Six Club,

Fort Worth, Texas, recently and observed R. D.

MATTHEWS, who

he understands is a hoodlu from Dallas, along with a former

prizo fighter from Dallas named TONY GENERO and a group of other

people whom he did not recognize

Informant stated at one time

during the evening, MATTHEWS got a telephone call and informant

overheard MATTHEWS stating to the operator

that the area code was

405 (Oklahoma City) and when he got his party he stated that all

was arranged and for the other party to "not sweat it"

tO One ANTHONY SALVATORE JACINE, IBI NO. 507 453 A, who has been

around Dallas recently going under the name of TONY GENERO

(phonetic) and has been seen by local police officers hanging

out at the Skyknight Club on Maple Street, Dallas, with MATTHEWS

and also one ALAN PAUL MARTINO. Separate Anti-Racketeering cases

have been opened on JACENE and MARTINO to determine their back
