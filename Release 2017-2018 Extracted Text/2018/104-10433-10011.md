OSWALD VS FoR CO

u z S report constitutes the first piece of substantive
formation about Lee Harvey Oswald's sojourn in Mexico City to
appear since the assassination of President Kennedy. We under-
stand the reluctance of the unidentified source to become
involved, but the fact-remains that this information cannot con~
tinue to be withheld or concealed. d

It is requested that you confer with Mr. Ruyle to deter-

His desire to stay out of trouble seems likelier to be
gratified through cooperation with U. S. authorities than it
would be if we were forced to turn the matter over to the Mexican
authorities,

It is also requested that you determine whether the
ttached information has been made available to LNERGO and, if
it has not, to request that this step be taken.

The information needed is the identity of the source, an
approximate date for the two days spent with Oswald, the identities
of all others in contact with Oswald at that tine, . and a detailed .
account of what happened.

Although the Werren Commission obtained no facts pointing

| fo ‘homosexuality on Oswald's part, this allegation has been made

It is therefore necessary to bear

this possibility in mind when interviewing the source and others
who spent time with Oswald in Mexico City. It is our hope that
the facts obtained through these interviews will help to. confirm
that several of Garrison's allegations about involvement of anti-

Official~Informal
CONFIDENTIAL

Weoley D. Boles, Esquire
Chief, Mexican Political Affairs, Office of Mexican Affairs
Dopartmont of State, Washington, D. C, 20520

Doar Wos: .

The missing Lee Harvey Oswald airgram reforred to in your letter of ,

April 4, is Tampico's A~43, which I drafted on March 16, It ought
to have reached you before April 1h. :

I had originally debated with myself whether to send anything at all,
considering my "informant" did not seem to offer anything new, How

ever, in viow of tho admittedly "eloctrifying quality" of the subject s
I finally decided to record the matter,

Because of your letter, I invited my friend to lunch today, We went” >”
over the ground in somewhat moro detail, as set; forth below, but he

did not claim he was making world-shaking revelations, and I do not
believe he was,

He said he and a group of fellow students met Oswald one afternoon
(he does not recall the date) when they came out of the Cineclus,
which I understood to be at the Egcuela de Filosofia (I am not familiar
with the University of Mexico), Ile described Oswald as Mraro" and
Braet

TAOONTRHEL "introvertide", a person who obviously had complexes and
problems,

Oswald was wit the group during the remainder of the afternoon and
evening and all the following day, They paid for his meals during thie
tine. (It was of interest to me my informant said that, in addition to
recormizing Oswald's photograph following the assassination of Prosidont
Kennedy, he easily recalled Oswald's name because both "Harvey" and
NQswald" connoted rabbit to him, something I hed not thought of.)

Oswald ovidently had gone to the university to look for pro-Castro students -
who might help bin persuade the Cuban Exbassy to grant hima vieq. He
spoke little Spanish, but indicated he as from California, as woll as
that he had been a menber of a proGrstro group in New Orleans (no

mention of Texas). He also pave thei to understand police agencies
in the United States had harrasscd him ("lo Hostilizagan"). He
showed an interest in painting and paintings.

My friend reports the Cuban Embassy turned Oswald down from the outset,
apparently in the first place because they had no “previous” on hin
and in the second place because they suspected he was a U.S. agent.

Oswald was deeply upset over being rejected by the Cubans. My
informant used the word “lloraba", but I inferred not literally. The
group Suw no more of Oswald after the second day.

I am not trying to be coy about my "informant's" name. I should
‘nevertheless like to protect him to the extent possible. He claims ,.,;
not to have discussed his acquaintance with Oswald with anyone except
me, I tako this with a grain of salt, but he does seem genuinely
fearful of losing his job if he is tied publicly to this matter.

He also scems fearful of trouble with his former pro-Castro student
| friends if they get the impression he "ratted" on anyone. 1 gather
| they are not altogether “former",. considering he says some of thom

still visit him here from time to time.

| Incidentally, he claims to have visited Cuba, to be well acquainted
with Raul Roa and, to a lesser degree, with Castro. He claims further |
to have been friendly with one Maria Teresa Proenza, who I understood [|
| him to say defected from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and may now
be in Miami. :

One item he "revealed" during our first evening particularly intrigued ‘
me. (He seemed subsequently, and probably with justification, especial ny.
fearful of the unpleasant consequences which might derive from any
publicity regarding it). He asserted he was the student who personally’
climbed XXXXKXXXXXXKX the Miguel Aleman statue on the UAH campus with ;
the dynamite--I believe he said dynamite--when it was mutilated some
years ago.

I am aware wy friend my have fabricated everything he told me. My =< |
personal evaluation is that he has been truthful.

Sincerely, Sa

Benjamin J. Ruyle’,

2, The Mexican information reviewed covered thfee
areas: APB
Sylvia DURAN Tirado. A Mexican female
‘employe:

y the Cuban Embassy in Mexico who provided! “ey
assistance to OSWALD in his attempts to obtain a Cub
visa, Information regarding DURAN appears in the Warren
Report, however, it is not attributed to the Agency.
The Government of Mexico (GOM) did arrest and interrogate
DURAN re her connection with OSWALD, and a copy of the
GOM deposition appears in the Report. The deposition was
turned over to the Commission by the GOM via State Department.
Since knowledge of DURAN's contact with OSWALD originally

ame to both the GOM's and Agency's attention via the

i teltap, all mention of Agency knowledge or

ion in DURAN's arrest and subsequent interrogation
“irked for non-release,

has been m

b. Photo of unidentified man(taken in front of)
he Soviet EmbaS eo. This photo was taken by
tation Nexico photo Surveillance of the Sovict Embassy
‘during the month of October 1963. When news cf the
arrest of OSWALD as Kennedy's assassin became known,
he Station immediately forwarded copies of the photo
to the FBI in the mistaken assumption that the photo

was of OSWALD taken while he was in Mexico that fall
It was later determined that. the photo not of

and in faet-had been taken after -he hind: departed México,

(OSWALD was in Mexico from 26 September thru. 3 October 1963.)

Even thowrh the photo was not of OSWALD it had been shown

to OSWALD's wife and mother, with the background partially

ALD



€raqpped in an eftort to disguise the place where the

‘photo had been taken. The photo became somewhat of an
issue when the Warren Commission decided it belonged 7
in the Report as part of the exhibits since it had been ,
shown to the OSWALDs. The Agency finally allowed the
picture to appear in the report with the background
completely blocked out and with the agreement that no
mention would be made about where it had been taken.
As far as can be determined, the Agency has never
admitted publicly that the photo was taken in Mexico,
even though there has been a great deal of speculation
to that effect by several authors and journalists. As
a matter of fact, one of the lawyers who worked with the
commission later leaked information(to ab
the photo, but erroneously sa ad been taken i,
£ in Mexico by CI,
T Seation, only
saying it was taken somewhere outside the U.S. All
mention of the photo has therefore been marked to be
withheld, because of sensitive sources and methods
involved.

c. Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte. ALVARADO, a -
Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S, Embassy in
Mexico, claiming to have knowledge re Kennedy's assasination.
Was Tearne: a Was an agent for the Nicaraguan,
Intelligence Service (NIS), however his story re the
ssassination was separate from his work for the NIS): After
ing a polygraph, 1 was
determined that ALVARADO had been fabricating a story claiming
he had seen OSWALD receive money from a Cuban official at
the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. The ALVARADO story appears
in the Warren Report but it does not rev. hi, In
jorder to continue to protec DO and the Nicaraguan
government from possible embarrassment all mention of
ALVARADO has been marked for non-release.

‘A list and copies of douments from the OSWALD file
ave been forwarded to your office for review by other(LAD
branches and possibly other Divisions. The documents are marked
according to which volume they belong in the 201 file (there
are 57 yolumes plus many bulky atachments.)

3, During the review, it was necessary several times to
refer to the Warren Report and the exhibits to ascertain
exactly what was already known about the Mexican aspect of the
case, It is doubtful that the other branches will find this
necessary, but in case they do, the Warren Report is held

in the Library.
