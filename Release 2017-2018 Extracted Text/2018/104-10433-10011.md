This report constitutes

the first piece of substantive

normation about Lee Harvey Oswald's sojourn in Mexico City to

appear since the assassination of President Kennedy We under

stand the reluctance of the unidentified source to become

Involved, but the tact remains that this intormation cannot con

tinue to

be withheld or concealed.

3. It is requested that you conter with Mr. Ruyle to deter-

the identity of the source and the best way

His desire to stay out of trouble seems likelier to be

gratitled through cooperation with U.

authorities than it

would be if we

were forced to turn the matter over to the Mexican

attached information

has been made available to uNErGO and, if

it has not, to request that this step be taken..

5. The information needed is the identity of the source,

approximate date for the two days spent with Oswald,

the identities

of all others in contact with Oswald at that time, and a detailed

account of what happened.

Although the Warren Commission obtained no facts poloting

o homosaxuality on Oswald's part,

this allegation has been made

by elements of the press covering District Attorney Jim Garrison's

It is therefore

necessary to bear

this possibility in mind when interviewing the source and others

who spent time with Oswald In Mexico City.

It is our hope that

the facts obtained through these interviews will help to confirm

that several of Garrison's allegations about involvement of anti-

Castro Cubans, WOFACT, etc., are false.

I finally decided to record the matter.

Because of your lotter, I invited my friend to lunch today. We went

over the ground in somewhat more detail, as set forth below, but he

did not claim he was making world-shaking revelations, and I do not

bollove he was.

He said he and a group of fellow students met Oswald one afternoon

(ho does not recall the date) when they came out of the Cineclub,

which I undorotood to be at the Escuela de Filosoila (I am not familiar

with the University of Mexico).

llo described Oswald as "raro" and

Exa "Introvertido", a person who obviously had complexes and

problems.

Oswald was wity the group during the remainder of the afternoon and

evening and all the following day. They paid for his meals during this

(It was of interest to me my informant said that, in addition to

rocognizing Oswald's photograph following tho assassination of Prosidont

Kennody, ho oasily rocalled Oswald'g name because both "Harvey" and

"Oswald" connotod rabbit to him, something I had not thought of.)

He claims

I take this with a grain

He also seems learful of trouble with his former pro-Castro student

I gather

they are not altogether "former",. considering he says some of them

still visit him here from time to time.

Incidentally, he claims to have visited Cuba, to be well acquainted

with Raul Roa

He claims further

to have been friendly with one Maria Teresa Proenza, who I understood

him to say defected from the Cuban Embassy 1n Mexico City and may now

be in Miami.

One item he "revealed" during our first evening particularly intrigued

me. (He seemed subsequently, and probably with justification, especially

The Government of Mexico (GOM) did arrest and interrogate

DURAN re her connection with OSWALD,

and a copy of the

GOM deposition appears in the Report.

The deposition was

turned over to the Commission by the GOM via State Department.

Since knowledge of DURAN's contact with OSWALD originally

came to both the GOM's and Agency's attention via.the

(bilateral)teltap, all mention of Agency knowledge or

has been marked for non-release.

cropped in an

eftort to disguise the place

where

the

photo had been taken. The photo became somewhat of an

issue when the Warren Commission decided it belonged

in the Report as part of the exhibits since it had been

shown to the OSWALDs.

The Agency finally allowed the

picture to appear in

the report with the background

completely blocked out and with the agreement

that no

mention would be made about where it had been taken.

As far as can be determined, the Agency has never

admitted publicly that the photo was taken in Mexico,

even though there has been a great deal of speculation

to that effect by several authors and journalists.

As

a matter of fact, one of the lawyers who worked with the

the Agency has not revealed the

actual location, only

saying it was taken somewhere outside the U.s.

All

mention of the photo has therefore been marked to

withheld, because of sensitive sources and methods

involved.

C.

Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte.

ALVARADO, a

Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S. Embassy in

claiming to have knowledge re Kennedy's assasination

It was learned that ALVARADO was an agent for the Nicaraguan)

Intelligence Service (NIS), however his story re the

assassination was separate

from his work for the NIS. After

Zengthy Interrogation,

thcluding

a polygraph,

IT was

determined that ALVARADO had been fabricating

a story claiming

he had seen OSWALD receive

money from a Cuban

official at

the Cuban Enbassy in Mexico.

The ALVARADO story appears

in the Warren Report but it does not reveal his identity.

order to continue to protect ALVARADO and the Nicaraguan

government from possible embarrassment all mention of

ALVARADO has been marked for non-release.

25 A list and copies of douments from the OSWALD file

have been forwarded to your office for review by other (LA)

branches and possibly other Divisions.

The documents

according to which volume they belong

the 201 file (there

are 57 volumes plus many bulky atachments.)

During the review, it was necessary several times to

refer to the Warren Report and the exhibits to ascertain

exactly what was already known about the Mexican aspect of the

case. It is doubtful that the other branches will find this

necessary, but in case they do, the Warren Report is held

in the Library.
