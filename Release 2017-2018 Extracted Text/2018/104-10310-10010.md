MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Special Group (5412) Meeting, Situation Reom at the
White House, 29 August 1963, 1430

1. In attendance were Mr. McGeorge Bundy, Mr. Gilpatric,
Mz. Alexis Johnsen, Mr. Tom Parrott and, for appropriate items,
Colonel Steakley of JRC and Mr. Bruce Cheever of CIA.

2. The moathly reconnaissance forecasts for both NRO and
DOD were approved in teto, although Secretary Johnson withheld
replenishing the Laos bank (since we still have a credit of one)
until he had been briefed by Lundabl ase to just how effective this
photography was. He appears to have some doubt that we are getting
anything that's worthwhile. :

3. On the problem of negotiations for an Indian base it was
the consensus that we should not approach Sarit at the present time
for use of Takhli unless there were overriding intelligence require-
mente approved by USIB at the next mesting. Gilpatric showed me
8 memorandum from General Carroll urging that we get the photos
and after the meeting I noted a somewhat less enthusiastic urging
frem Sheldon. While the Special Group did not seem to be enthusi-
astic about making the fights, they agreed to withhold judgment
pending a USIB reaction from the meeting next Thureday. Please
have it placed on the agenda for discussion.

4. There was some discussion on the support of autonomous
anti-Castro groupe and some concern as to what reactions we
might expect fram Castro. Mr. Bundy asked that thie item be held
over for the meeting next week at which time he would want to
ebtain Mr. McCone's views since Mr. McCone had etated that he
wanted to take another look at the matter. The Group (particularly
Johnsen) did net seem te be enthusiastic about using a British-owned
istand without telling the Britdeh. There were warm remarke made
about Mr. Pawley's capabilities although Bundy expressed some


apy

concern that since Pawley had bean such & staunch supporter of
the Agency and of any Governmental activities regardlese of
party lines, he might not be the proper man to use a8 & cutout.
Please see that this item is placed on next week's Special Group
($412) agenda and that Mr. McCGene has formulated his views.

5. Financial support for the Institute for Political Education
in San Jose, Costa Rica, wae approved without comment.

6 The minutes of the 15 August meeting were approved and
I informed them that the sidewinder migsile for the defenaive
armament fer GROSBEAK aircraft had already been compremiced
eo there wae no problem there,

mi)
7. The only discussion on the covert action program in (taly)

for FY '64 wae Mr. Bundy's comment that for the first time the

President had not questioned the magnitude of the expenditures.

8. Mr. Cheever reported on the two approved sabotage
operations and Johnsen questioned whether the leaving behind of
equipment might be a form ef subversion. Gheever assured him
that lote of people leave behind equipment, particularly when they
are getting shot at and he did not think there was a security problem
here.

9. The Group agreed that the Agency should prepare a memo
or & report as te what reactions ac to type, magnitude, and timing
we might expect from Castro as these sabotage operations continue.
There was some thought thet he might make seme covert moves to
embarrass ug in Guantanamo, perhaps in cemection with our water
gupply. Please have such a memorandum prepared.

16. The meeting broke up in geod order.
