RE: ARRB Additional Information Request No,CIA-2
Dear John: .

As you know, the ARRB Board at its May 19, 1995 meeting concluded that it required
additional specific information before it could review the CLA records under discussion
at this meeting. Based upon my discussions with you and with Barry Harrelson, 1
understand that the Historical Review Group can respond only to questions that draw
upon information already on hand, and that any questions requiring further research
will go to the components for a response.

Since I understand from you and Barry that it will be faster if we divide those of our
questions directed to the Historical Review Group from those directed to the
components, we are submitting two separate lists for CLA’s response. List 1, which we
are submitting to the Historical Review Group, asks basic questions about documents,
including the Mexico chronology, which HRG has not previously addressed. List 2
asks for the answers to questions about names, pseudonyms, and crypts that go beyond
what we understand is HRG’s current available information.

Since the ARRB Board will consider these documents at its June 7, 1995 meeting, we
hope to have this information by then. Thank you for your continued cooperation, and
we look forward to your response. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn
for any clarification regarding these requests.

Sincerely yours,

S24 (i @

Re: Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for
Additional Information and Records :

Dear Barry: *
Iam writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of
Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the
CIA.
We discussed the following formal requests:
CIA-1 (Organization materials)
CIA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board
staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board
and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to
do nothing further at this time.
CIA-2-5 Complete -
CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)
CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could
be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the
records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.
CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CLA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will
compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

Boaro Memaens: John R. Tunheim, Chair + Henry F. Graff « Kermit L. Hall « William L. Joyce * Anna K. Nelson
Executive Dinecror: David G. Marwell

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then
determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that
should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the “Blakey
version” as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the
documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the
staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.
CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and
will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests
where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make
histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review
histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not
discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,
within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to
make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further
discussions.
Cram’s multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram’s
history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board
staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board
staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)
CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)
The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as
they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on
recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make
records available within two weeks.

CIA-11 (Duran’s original statement)


13-00000

Mr. Barry Harrelson
October 7, 1996
Page 3

CIA has been unable to identify to date Duran’s original statement. CIA
will make some further attempts to locate it.
CIA-12 (MWAVE materials)
CIA will begin to make materials available on a rolling basis.
With respect to the informal requests, it is our understanding that:

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Spas Raikin. The Review Board staff will
discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is locating a.cable number IN 24738 (7 July 62), which is identified in record
number 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630 (Box 34, F 22), p. 2.

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Marilyn D. Murrett. The Review Board
staff will discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is continuing to search for HTLINGUAL records, particularly those
identified in Church Committee index that was provided to CIA by Review
Board staff. CIA is prepared to provide oral briefing on HTLINGUAL.

Please let me know if you have any supplements or corrections. We would very much
like to ensure that these matters are handled expeditiously.

As always, thanks for your cooperation and assistance.
