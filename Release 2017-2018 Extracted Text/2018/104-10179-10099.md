His brothor was taken prisoner and kept in a room in the

police station.- In this room short arms revolvers and pistols

were left

at his reach. The wife of the brother and Mr. Jose

Currais frlend of both Manuel and the brother went to see Manuel

Ray to tell him that his brother was set up io make him commit

suicide. - He was told by both that the emotional condition of

his brother was very bad because he Manuel had refused to talk

or visit him. - Although both persons in more than once visited

him in the hours that preceded the death of his brother Manuel

Ray said ho would not visit his brother because he was Secretar

ry of Public Works and if his brother was not guilty he would

be judge and freed.

After his brother committed suicide, during the burial

ceremony Ray's father made a speech claiming that his son was

free from any guilt and the Cabinet membere were to blame for

bie son's death. - The wilter can not anure Ray's brother ald

anything wrong but beleives

o most probably what happened was due

to the disorganization that exiated in at those moments.

Nanuel Ray, even thoughy a normal person would have resig-

ned his governmert post due to all this evento not only maintat-

ned himself on the job, but was one of the most enthusiastic com

llaborators of Castro.

Aftor Ray was ousted from his Cabinet Job and assigned

to a job of less importance he kept visiting Fidel Castro and

accompanying him, occupying a prominent position, in all his

public appearances. - He expressed to friends that even though he

was not on a prominent position he thought the revolution was

doing good to Cuba and had his whole support and should be sup

ported by everybody.

dox Party, which has been

Not Idealism as some may bellevo

Ray has been described by many as an ambitious nan

who will sacrifice anything OR ANYBODY for these ambitions.

Mr. Adolfo Arenas has said that the people who wor

ked with him durina the resintance against Batista say these

two instances show he will sacrifice people to obtain hie a

bitions.-

He planned an assault on a gun shop in Havana in the

month of April 1958 knowing:

Ist. - That it was impossible to do because it was at

a time the auto traffic was at its peak..

2nd. - There were not enough guns at the shop worth

while stealing.

3rd.- Even though they would have been successful

their ultimate goal the attack on the Cabañia fortress would

only bring death to the attackers.

Yet he sent those people to their death to have more

martyrs but did not go himself.

Wher he was thrown out of the Cabinet post he Inven

He maintained himself close to Fidel Castro until he saw Cas-

tro would not pass through a Cabinet session for approval the

publicly and in private conversations his approval of Castro'o

policies.

Although there is no proof of him ever belonging to

the Communist Party it is believed that he will deal and be-
