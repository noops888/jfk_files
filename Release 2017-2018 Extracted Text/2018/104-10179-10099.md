Ray has been described by many as an ambitious ni
who will sacrifice anything oR aNyBopy for these ambitions

Mr. Adolfo Arenas hae said that the people who wor-
ked with him during the resiatance against Batista say these
two instances show he will sacrifice people to obtain h

bitions.-

He planned an assault on a gun shop in Havana in

month of April 1958 knowing:
lst.- That it was impossible to do because it was at

a time the auto traffic was at its peak.-

2nd,- There were not enough guns at the shop worth

while stealing.-
3rd.- Even though they would have been successful =.

their ultimate goal the attack on the Cabafia fortress would

only bring death to the attackers.~

Yet he sent those people to their death to have moré

martyrs but did not go himself.-

publicly and in private conversations his approval of Cast:

policies.-
Although there is no progt sf him ever belongi ig
the Communist Party it is believed that he will deal and bo-

Considers him a fanatic that will pursue an idéa without

regard to tho welfare of his family, even though unimportant.
" unpractical and bad manager to the extreme that he has

failed in three business enterprises he tried to develop.-

he perpibes in, he says although he has no knowledge of communist
connection he follows the same principles as Fidel Castro and be-~
leives the measures taken by Castro are good.~

Unmerciful, a det fect he showed when he was Secretary of
Public Works he through out hundreds of employees without due cause,
he destroyed every successful contractor that existed to that mo~
