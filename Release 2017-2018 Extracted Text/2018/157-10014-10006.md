Senator llart of Colorado. Gentlemer, let's go ahead and

be sworn and get under way if you don't mind.

Do you swear the testimony you're about to give will be

the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help

you God?

Mr. Angleton. I do.

Mi. Milor. I do.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Thank you very much.

Mr. Angleton at least has been before us before, and

routinely we remind all witnesses that they preserve all of

their constitutional rights, including the right to counsel,

the right to remain silent and so

forth and

so on, and to have

a member of the Committee present during all of the testimony.

It is my understanding we have no prepared statements to

start with, so I think I'll just open

it up to staff questions

and interject some of my own, and I understand that the general

subject matter to be discussed here today - and we are interested

in your expertise regarding the question of counterintelligence:

so, we'll just have the staff members

start.

TESTIMONY OF JAMES ANGLETON

ACCOMPANIED BY SCOTTY MILÉR

Mr. Johnson. I wonder if we could begin by having both

of your gentlemen give us some information on your backgrounds,

beginning with Mr. Angleton.

Mr. Angleton. I entered the OSS in 1943 from the Army.

went into training in Washington and environs and then to

London, and then

eventually to Italy, and I took over as

Chief, Counterintelligence in Italy, and eventually took over

as Chief, OSS.

I returned in about '47, '48, and various jobs in both

espionage and counterintelligence. At one time Chief of

Operations and eventually Chief of Counterintelligence, and

that was from about 1954 until 1974.

Mr. Johnson. Mr. Miler?

MI. Miler. I entered OSS in 1946. I was sent to China.

I was in China until 1949, transferred to Japan, became involved

in intelligence aspects of the Korean War. I served in Thailand,

the

Philippines,

as I said, China, Japan, Ethiopia. I traveled:

extensively, was

a station chief abroad, and for the last ton

years I have been in Counterintelligence, first in the

Special Investigations, and subsequently as Chief of Operations:

for MI. Angleton's Counterintelligence Staff.

And wilen I left the Agency in December of 174, that was

ny position.

Mr. Johnson. So both of you left the CIA in December, 19744

Since that time we understand there have been some changes

in how counterintelligence is conducted at the CIA.

Could you give us some understanding of those changes?

Mr. Angleton. I would like to defer to Mr. Miler on this,

if I may?

MI. Miler. Yes.

My understanding is there have been some rather fundamental

and

substantive changes which are a continuation, actually,

of

changes that were made first in 1973, in July of 1973

when many of the centralized counterintelligence functions were

decentralized and reallocated to different components of the

Directorate of Operations. Such things as agent approvals and

security, operational security reviews for intelligence

collection and covert action operations; the oversight on

intelligence operations, and oversight on counterintelligence

operations in the field were decentralized. Research and

Analysis has been curtailed, and the emphasis on it has changed!

There have been changes in the record

procedures.

Mr. Johnson. Could you be more specific on these changes,

for example, in research?

Mr. Miler. In research, the research is now, as I under-

stand it, pretty much on a case by case basis, not in an

overall perception of worldwide or national counterintelligun

problems. There is no -- the application of historical cases,

historical problems is not being applied, as I understand it,

to current operational efforts or investigative needs. There is

an entirely different philosophy being applied as to what may

be required in terms of understanding the counterintelligence

threat to this nation. There is very little emphasis, if any, or

concern with such things as deception and disinformation. There

is little application of analytical

and assessment work to the

overall role of foreign intelligence and security services in

political action.

There have been some fundamental changes in operational

philosophies stemming from an application of what is termed

management by objectives as it is being applied in the CIA to

operations, and there

is a -- has been a distinct change in

some of the attention which has been previously placed on the

problem of penetration from foreign and particularly hostile

intelligence

services into the American community.

And there has been a very, very substantivè change in

the perception and the conduct of counterintelligence in that

there has been what is in my view a very

serious crosion

of

security and compartmentation of operations, and leakage

of information which has not been to the best interests of

a national counterintelligence effort.

Mr. Johnson.

So, from going from a rather centralized

apparatus to a decentralized situation, the dangers of penetration

have increased.

Mr. Miler. The dangers of penetration have increased

significantly, and this extends also to the methods by which

relations with foreign intelligence services are conducted.

Mr. Johnson.

But how do you respond to the criticism that

during your tenure and Mr. Angleton's tenure, too tight a

rain was kept on counterintelligence information, and individuals

in the field at the station level failed to get the information

they needed to conduct their counterintelligence operation?

MI. Miler. I would have to respond to that, Mr. Johnson,

and I could only respond to it in the context of specifics.

To my knowledge, and as practiced from my position as Chief of

Operations, whenever there was information which was judged

to be of significance, importance to a

field

station, that

field station was advised, unless there was

some overriding

security source protection or other considerations, and the

decision then not to advise them was made at the Deputy

Director for Operations, as it is now called, or the Director

level.

There was, certainly, a very tight security, a very

tight compartmentation of counterintelligence information and

activities, which in my view was essential, and still is

essential, and will be even

more essential in the future if

we are to regain a counterintelligence initiative and to do

our job in the future. And I think this is the fundamental

question that the management of the CIA and the Senate and the

Executive have to decide, is do we want a counterintelligence

effort, and if so, then we have to get to it, and we have to

put our best minds to it.

Mr. Johnson. Were there instances during your period in

counterintelligence where the Counterintelligence Staff would

conduct its own counterespionage activities, without the knowledge

of the various geographic division chiefs?

MI. Miler. There were very few of them, with the chiefs.

There may have been some.

MI. Johnson. In those cases where there were such

operations, were they cleared with the Do?

MI. Miler.

Every single one of them

wag cleared with the

DDO and/or the Director and/or the Deputy Director.

Mr. Johnson.

On important counterespionage operations,

could you tell us

in more detail what the approval and clearance

process is?

We know that for covert action the 40 Committee frequently

becomes involved. What about for important counterespionage

operations?

Mr. Miler: Well, Mr. Angleton might want to qualify my

response, because obviously

he was

involved more in this

than I was, but there would be the two primary considerations.

One was a strictly CIA, counterintelligence or counterespionage

activity. The derivation of the authority for this came from

the statutes which set up the CIA and from National Security

Council directives 53, 55 and so forth. The authority rested

in there. The approval would go to the then DDP, now Deputy

Director for Operations, the Deputy Diroctor and/or the

Director.

The authoritics, if it were a significant counterintelligenc:

or counterespionage case, the authorities, as I understood it

then, might require the Director to go outside the Agency to

the White House or the Attorney General and so forth.

Alternatively, we in the CI Staff might be directed to

coordinate this with the FBI. We would go to the FBI, explain

the case and so forth. The fBI would then go to the Attorney

the Department of Justice and get authorities, whatever

authorities they would require in order to pursue the investi-

gations, conduct the case, and do it according to whatever

stipulations that the Department of Justice: would put on it

in order to either neutralize the

suspected

Spy or agent, and/or

conclude the case by prosecution.

And I am talking now of primarily in terms of a serious

counterespionage case involving an American citizen.

Mr. Johnson. Mr. Angleton, do you know of any instances

where the Cl Staff of higher authority within the CIA went

outside the Agency for approval for important counterespionage

operations?

Mr. Angleton. I know of cases, yes.

Mr. Joinson. And what would the approval system

be?

Mr. Angleton. Well, it would be an ad hoe discussion

between the Director and the Secretary, and probably others,

the Attorney Genoral.

Mr. Johnson. Does this happen frequently? Is this a typionl

procedure for a major counter operation?

Mr. Angleton. If it's a major mattor, it's on the basis

of need to know.

You have another kind of case where a foreigner came to

me and stated his government had a defector from the Bloc, an

excellent agent, and they would be prepared to give us the agent

if we would take it over lock, stock and barrel, handle it

in such a fashion that

there would be no exposure, because of

the political consequences to their government.

I would go to the Director and the Deputy Director, spell

out the matter, and come to a determination with them whether

we wanted to take the case on. This particular case invoived

not only a person who had been in the intelligence service of

the opposition a long time, but he had access to codes, and alsa

a great deal of deciphered material. So it was kicked back

and forth, and there was a determination made that we would

take it over, the staff would take it over in its entirety.

And therefore, it meant that I called in Scotty and we

pulled together our team, we sent them abroad. We handled the

man in the field for a long time, and then eventually brought

him back here.

In a case of that sort, the instruction was agreed upon

that the Bureau, only two or three people in the Bureau, by

requirements required by the Attorney General

all other agencies, were done. However, in this instance, the;

Now, this is important, because the individual was of

the term "counterintelligence" interchangeable with counter-

Mr. Angleton.

It can be. I think technically counter-

activity, travel control, your data files, your dossiers, all

Out of that emerges a product, and one of the products is

Senator lart of Colorado. I see.

Now big was the Counterintelligence

Staff?

MI. Angleton. When? Well, when it was in its prime it

was around, it was 200 some odd people. After this decentraliza-

tion took place, when we lost international Communism, which in

no service in the world has it ever been divorced from

counterintelligence; we lost our police division where we

over the Technical Services Division; we lost the geographic

representation; we lost liaison, which was the liaison was with

the FBI and 26, other government agencies who do investigations.

MI. Miler. They took'

counterintelligence and liaison

away from the counterintelligence component, If you can imagine

such a situation.

MI. Angleton.

So that reduced us to less than 80 people,

and this comes to, Senator, if I can just point to one of the

most important things in the legislation or in whatever the

Executive does, is that you cannot have in my view a Director

of the FBI and a Director of CIA who are independent of one

another. You have to have some higher authority to whom you

can make an appeal when decisions of this sort are made so that

the

decline in the Bureau over 20 years from when they had very high

grade counterintelligence until today when there has probably

Senator liart of Colorado. Why is that?

MI. Angleton. Well, I think it has to do with the number:

of diversiong it had in the days of the Vietnam war, when

Internal security lost a tremendous number of men to other

assignments and duties.

Second, I don't think that counterintelligence or the

real thrust of Soviet Bloc intelligence has ever been brought !

up to policy level, and, more important, anything, that involves

penetration has always been swept under the rug.

In other

words, the question of penetration in this government or

penetration in any agency has never been brought to a responsible

level of finding out how it happened

and what has gone wroni.

And let's take one defector who said - in this case he

met with the defector for three days.

The

original reaction to President Kennedy's letter

was, it was Soviet provocation, because this was at the stage

when

was making certain very sensitive agreements in the

atomic field and otherwise with the United States, and therefore

these allegations of penetration had a very direct bearing on

those negotiations. And so the General who came over was

totally prepared to believe this was provocation, but after

three days with the defector, in a meeting with llelms and

myself, he stated without any question that this man was 100

percent bona fide, because he could ask

him those questions

right on the nerve of their secrets, and he got the responses.

Now, this defector also gave considerable data on

the

status of penetration in the U.S. Government, documents which

he had

seen in Moscow, cryptonyms of operating agents, documents

which could only have been prepared by our organization, and

many other cases going back into the early '5os, going almost

to Cabinet level. So all of this information was made available

to the Bureau. But in due course Mi.. Hoover regarded or made

Senator Hart of Colorado. Why did lloover make that

decision?

MI. Angleton. Well, among other things, this defector

wanted to have access to ongoing and to past cases with the

view that he had a tremendous amount of data that he could not

relate to anything, but if he could see things that were going

on, then it would be meaningful to him in terms of what he had

to contribute. And I can take the example that, with another

allied service; immediately we brought them into it and he had

seen certain naval documents that dealt with infrastructure and

budget. This happened to

be

In time they found the documents, and when they presented

them to him, he could identify those he had

seen and those he

rassa!

had not seen. This led to the apprehension of Vassil, who

was in the admiralty. And this was the quallty of his

information.

All through the west agents were apprehended on the basis

of his information.

But there is a tremendous bulk of it which

is made up of fragments, made up of documents he's seen where

we have not been

able to identify the document; a great number

of cryptonyms of reporting sources. where we cannot find the

body to fit the cryptonym. So this is the

reality. And he is

Now, there is no one who has supported the question of

his mala fides. In other words, everyone, to a man, has

stated that he is bona fide, that they have never been able to

disprove a statement of fact that he has given as a statement of

fact, although they do not necessarily agree with his hypotheses.

That is the official statement.

MI. Miler. May I just add two things on this?

First, Mr. Johnson, it goes back to the business of

compartmentation and not advising stations. In the case Mr.

Angleton cited, the Paris station of the CIA was not told

anything about the information, and I think this is a very goodi

example of why you would not.

The second point I would like to follow up on is with

respect to this defector's information, there were five leads

which were passed to the FBI about penetration which involved

the CIA, for action. And one case was solved, but it was

solved only after the FBI officially sent us a letter saying

that they concluded that there was no substance to this

information.

They had to reopen the investigation -

MI. Angleton. And they also said: send it to the Army.

MI. Miler. Yes,

send it to the Army.

Now, they had to reopen the investigation when their

surveillance spotted a man coming out of the soviet embassy, and

It was subsequently proved that he was a Soviet spy.

Mx. Angleton.

Now, that individual had performed four

separate missions for Soviet intelligence since about 1938 or

'39. One, he had been dropped in by the Soviets into Germany

on a mission with the WT set, to be captured in order to be

played back and to penetrate the German intelligence.

Second, he had moved from that into the penetration of

VIASEV

the Vassilov movement, which were the captured Russians in the

VLAJOY

German:. --. in the Vassilov Army.

Third, he had penetrated the anti-Soviet forces in Germany

and then he was taken on by us in 1948 or '51 is when they

sent to renew his inks.

So he was with us from '51 to around '60.

Well, when

the defection occurred, it was '62.

MI. Johnson. And MI. Angleton, you used a term that is

unfamiliar to us: his inks.

MI. Miler. Secret inks.

Mr. Angleton. Secret inks. " In other words, the Germans

had captured a Soviet agent who had the same kind of

inks, and so therefore

the inks were compromised, so they laid

on a large operation

in Berlin and trained him in highly

sophisticated inks. And he is now

we maintained that he is a Soviet agent, and the Bureau disagreed

and told us to send this off, we had a development occur which

it is not necessary for me to go into, it's still a relatively

live case, in which proof positive came that he was a Soviet

agent, and it was in the face of that proof positive that the

Bureau moved in and interrogated him. And that is what prompted

him to go to the Soviet embassy.

And after some hours there he came out, he was asked why

did you go to the Soviet embassy, and he said I went there to

get my personal history and particulars regarding my family

since those are the questions you have been asking me. In

other words, instead

of -- in this case the man had a wife

who was having an affair off and on with a Japanese military

person here - instead of recruiting the Japanese and the wife

to work in to him, because what we wanted was a confession,

because the point I want to stress here is in a case of this

sort, a penetration there, he is not there as a solo person.

He is there as a spotter. He is a person used for entrapment

abroad. He is a person who can originate an operation,

induce you to go into the operation and bring in a weak

element, and put them in a position for further recruitment.

And I can stretch this on and on.

And the classic example is the Philby case. riilby

would have been Chief of British Intelligence. He was also

identified positively in the end by this defector. When the

defector first knew about it, it was called the Ring of Five

In the soviet Intelligence, five people, philby being one.

But from the time he knew about it, in actual fact it

was a ring that went into the twenties, because the purpose

of the penetration is simply not to be a passive figure; it is

to be an aggressive figure who creates situationg for recruit-

ment. And that case has. never been prosecuted. The man has

never confessed. He's never been broken. And yet it was in

the heart of our SB, Soviet Division activities.

Senator llart of Colorado. Could you give us, back to the

quantification, could you give us some figures for numbers of

counterintelligence cases handled per year?

MI. Angleton. Scotty, you can.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Just so we can have an idea

of the magnitude of volume.

MI. Miler. Well, for example, one, program that we had

going was an attempt to record penetration recruitment attempts

of U.S., American officials abroad, strictly abroad. And over

a ten year period the number of attempts to recruit and

penetrate hit close to 1200. So we were running around 250 gr

so a

year, just in that one small area of counterintelligenc

concern.

The number of cases that we had would vary, but I would

say that from defectors in the last ten year, from Soviet

and Soviet Bloc defectors, we averaged

around 150 cases a

year. At one time -- I do know that at one time we had over

We were concerned with approximately 140 to 160 double

that were going on, in addition to which we would have a

number of investigations, leads and operations with cooperative;

There were other operations which were generated from other

What about the number of cascs

involving penetration, successful or otherwise, of the Agency

itself?

Mr. Angleton. Well, the basic responsibility would be

the Office of Security. In other words, we would work with

them, but it tends to be a one way street, as it should be,

namely, they

are

responsible for personnel and for installations.

But from the one defector alone, I would say there were five

hard leads.

what period of time?

December of '61. But his leads were going back to '51, 1951.

Mr. Angleton. Yes, we've had it, but we've had our

ups and downs.

MI. diGenova.

And what have those ups and downs been

attributable to?

Mx. Angleton. Well, they are basic - well, first, there

are two different attitudes in the American intelligence

community regarding defectors. One of them is to give them

the harsh treatment and to treat them as second class citizens,

and we actually have taken on more

salvage cases

in the

Counterintelligence Staff and rehabilitated these people. In

fact, we came into that case basically because the fellow hau

gone sour. And --

MI. Kirbow. Meaning he had failed to continue cooperatingi

or was not giving you the right information?

Mr. Angleton. That's right. Well, no, it was simply that

he refused to cooperate any further, because one didn't appru-

ciate the

ideological reasons for his defection.

So these ups and downs would go on -- I mean, we would

have to change case officers because they would simply have

breakdown in communication.

asset inhibit you in any way from using the asset of the Agency

Mr. Angleton. Absolutely, because so much of the infor-

mation that we wanted to take up with him was also related to

FBI information.

MI. diGenova. In other words,. you needed access to

Information the FBI had, and you couldn't get 1t?

Mr. Angleton. We could get it but they wouldn't give

permission that their information would be submitted to him.

Mr. diGenova. In other words, you had a third agency

Iule blocking you?

MI. Angleton. A third agency, also in the attitude.

For instance, in one

session in which I participated, the

Bureau asked him to give the name of a source.

He refused to

give it on the grounds that the man was in the KGB, was a

friend of his, and he didn't want that man's name ever to

get back to the KGB because it would mean

the man's life.

And therefore he had a direct confrontation, refusing to give

it, very understandable.

MI, diGenova.

Was this lack of cooperation directly

attributable to MI. Hoover, to your knowledge?

Mr. Angleton.

no.

Mr. diGenova. Was this problem ever brought to the

attention of the President of the United States at any time?

General Mr. Kennedy, he had a direct meeting with him.

Mr. diGenova. Could you amplify on that?

Mr. Angleton. Well, the Attorney General handled him

very well indeed, but nothing further came out of it.

MI. diGenova. But there was no commitment on the part of

the Attorney General to see if he could budge: Mr. Hoover to

assist the Agency?

MI. Angleton.

well, the issue didn't come up in that

fashion, just the general, the general agreement that he was

prepared to work for the United States at the highest level,

because the intelligence he had went far beyond simply KGB.

It went into Soviet policy. It went into Soviet reorientation.

It went into Soviet Bloc. It went into Soviet defense matters.

It went into some of the major secrets. And therefore it wasn't

simply counterintelligence. It had to do with policy or

political action.

He knew, for example, the identity of a Prime Minister

who was a soviet agent, who at that time was trying to get us

to go into several political arrangements, and he knew

exactly how he was recruited and how he was being used

as an

agent of influence.

So these were

matters that went beyond simply intelligenc

scope.

Angleton? I mean, by this time, or a decade from now, a lot

of that information is of no longer any value to you.

No. Angerson. iu, thul's not su. It is a fact that the

man has a computer mind. In other words, If you took all of

his interrogation reports, they ran to some 20 filing cabinets.

You try to have anyone retain in their mind, to apply that

same data against a now problem that comes up, it requires an

individual who lived that to be able to look at a case that

has arisen, and he knows

the case officer on the Soviet side,

and he can

give an analysis that this fellow was on the Scandi-

navian desk and that he was promoted to this, and that his

background is ciphers.

He had not told you that he: was ciphers

before because it wasn't relevant. So it's a new, added

factor.

And then you find that someone. is known

as a code clerk, and therefore the pieces begin to fit

together, that the man who was sent to the field by the soviets

to handle some unknown American is a ciphèr expert, and therefote

you look among who are the

code clerks.

MI. Miller. What kind of volume did you put together in

your years in this activity? If this is the product of one

interrogation, what kind of volume did you put together to

make a workable capability?

Mr. Angleton. Well, the first thing was to computerize

everything, and the second was to break it out case by case,

British cases, Australian cases, New Zealand cages, Dutch

cases, Finnish cases, French cases, Italian cases, all the

way on across the board; American cases; and then to take all

of the data, all of the voluminous stuff that was pertinent

to each of the leads, including the

unknowns, in other words,

Unknown 1, Unknown 2, Unknown 3, etc.

So you had the ability to pick out a file on X subject or

X individual, and there would be the direct quotation from the

interrogation,

and then whatever traces there were of follow-ups,

action taken, dissemination, etc.

Mr. Miller. Just to press

that -- yes.

MI. Miler. I think your question is the total volume of

the

files that were available to the Counterintelligence?

Mr. Miller. Yes. I was impressed by the fact that one

interrogation yielded 20 file cabinets, and was wondering the

total volume.

Mr. Miler. What were the figures on the cases to read?

was all this business of objectives and management by objectives,

and the idea of changing Counterintelligence personnel every

two years and new faces and open it all up and the rest of it,

we ran a basic job on how many, if you took 20 cases that were

imperative for a Counterintelligence officor to read, what the

statistical side would be. Those 20 cases would run into enougl

linear footage, which according to the mathematicians in the

Agency would take 22 man years to read, or if they were 100

percent incorrect, ll years to read. Those would be the 20

basic counterintelligence cases.

And the purpose of it was simply to show that it was a

profession, and that there had to be longevity to build up.

Counterintelligence officers.

Mr. Johnson. Generally speaking, within the counterintell-

gence organizations, it seems to you perform four activities:

liaison, research, operations and security.

Could you give us an idea of your own priorities in

terms of distributing manpower across those four activities?

Can you break

it out that way?

Mr. Ingleton. Well, it is difficult to break out, but

the primary thing of all is the question of penetration in the

U.S. Government, and then

in allied

governments.

That would t

my priority. In other words, when we had a defector from the

they would differentiate the priorities, and areas where the

KGB was oversurveilled, the DGI would take over the surveillance

of our personnel and so on.

The moment this defector arrived in the United States, I

sent Scotty to the airport immediately to see him because that's

the number one priority. Here was an individual whose job

was to work on Americans and who allegedly had seen information

from one of our embassies. Now, that is the highest priority,

and particularly because information of a counterintelligence

nature is perishable. Some is and some isn't.

The moment there is a defector, the opposition runs a

danage report. So you know certain information will be known

to them immediately that is compromised, and they will take

action to correct it. But there are certain secrets that the

man knows that their damage report will not turn up. Those

you put on the back burner. But the ones you reach for first

are those that are perishable, and this is -- the priority is

established by the fact that here is a live, highly valuable

force, and we only have so much time to extract the cream off

of him and determine those things that would disappear.

Mr. Miler. But the whole thrust of all of our operations,

research, analysis, everything, was toward that goal. And much!

of the reason

for the

security of the compartmentation for

the CI activity was to protect that concern.

in a way they had never been brought into it, we brought them

down when this flst defector, this major defector

honestly state that since Norld War II the British have never

caught an agent where the lead didn't come from us or somebody

else. It was never self-generated.

Now, in the last year of so maybe they caught an ágent,

but up until that time they have never caught an agent.

MI. Lombard. So your answer, in effect, would be that

the counterintelligence function should stay within the Burcau.

Mr. Angleton. That is correct. I mean, not that it's

ideal, but in terms of the realitles, in terms of the realities

it should be kept within the Bureau. It should be greatly

enlarged, and the head of that should be, in my view, a Deputy

Director of the Bureau.

Mr. Lombard. All right.

Now, let me ask you this. In your experience were there

problems where the law enforcement impded the running of

counterintelligence or counterespionage operations domestically?

In other words, were there times when you would have liked to

have run an agent domestically for a longer period of time

in order to get the rest of the guys, but they said no, we've

got to take this fellow to court now?

Mr. Angleton. That used to be prevalent back in the '50s.

Today I don't think they've got many cases. I mean, I don't

think that the job is being done, not in the last ten years.

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think that how could

you have it

any other way?

If you've got a cryptonym of telegrams disappearing and

are in possession of the opposition -

Mr. Johnson.

But isn't the aggressive dimension even

more important and trying to penetrate the hostile service?

Mr. Angleton. Those are all kind of theoretical arguments

to my way of thinking.

Mr. Miler. You have to know what you're penetrating

first:

Mr. Angleton. Imean, this idea of running operations is

not

really understood.

To run a double agent operation requires a tremendous

amount of manpower. It is a commitment that very few people

understand. If you are going to run a double, I mean, to starti

from the beginning, you've got to be able to keep a diary.

Now, one is the real life is the real life of the agent and

the other is his double life, becaus you can have

a question

from his headquarters that says, that agent you had three

years ago, would you please go back to him. You've got to

be able to read into a diary of the fictional life in order

to answer that question.

Now, this takes manpower. You've got to have meetings.

You've got to be able to satisfy the questionnaltes, and you

can go all the way on down the line. This ties up thousands of

man-hours.

Mr. Johnson. Could you explain that "satisfy the

questionnaires?"

What does that phrase mean, "satisfy the questionnaires?"

Mr. Angleton. The opposition wants to know, find out

from your sources the following guestions.

Mr. Miler. In other words, the requirements they put

on the agent.

Mr. Angleton. Now, that agent is allegedly in the CIA

and there is a penetration, then you are just going through

games, and they will play such an operation.

They could have

a very senior penetration into the Agency and play along on

a double in order to lead you to believe that they do not have

a penetration. And they can tie up your manpower and put

doubles underneath him and another agent, and they can give

him a radio set, and with the radio set they can give him

crystals, and he needs other crystals, and it involves more

and more of your own personnel and manpower. And you can

tie up NSA: monitoring

all the links.

And so this idea that has all of a sudden been novel

and

newly discovered in the Agency that Counterintelligence must

ive aggressive is in my view a joke. It's a joke.

Mr. Miler. You have to know what you're dealing with.

You have to understand the enemy Intélligence service before

you're going to penetrate it, and you have to be secure from

penetration yourself, and you then have to run that penetration

very securely and on a very compartmented basis.

Mr. Angleton. And there is one added proviso, then, that

you can only run a first rate double agent if you have a

source superior to him

that he is unaware of. In the war,

when we broke the German code, it was no problem to run German

double agents because we could read their messages back to

their headquarters, re-enciphered, and the headquarters message?

back to the control, back to our double. So questions of

danger signals, questions of alerting him that he was under

control and so on was taken care of because of communications

intelligence.

When you don't have communications intelligence, then

the only other source that is superior is penetration, that is.

somebody who can read back from their headquarters how they aro,

in fact, absorbing the thrust of that double agent. And those

conditions do not exist for the Bureau

or for ourselves.

MI. Miler. Or for the military services, to run a lot

of double agents.

MI. Angleton. I mean, they do not have the superior

source of control over double agents.

MI. Miler. You're not going to get substance.

Mr. diGenova. Why was that decision made? That seems to

be so fundamentally apparent by the way you explain it? Surely

the Director must have made that decision for a reason?

Do you know why?

MI. Angleton.

Mr. Miler has known him more than -- longer;

than I have. Would you?

Mr. Miler.

Yes, I'll offer my opinion on it.

Mr. diGenova. We would like to have it.

Mr. Miler. The basic reason is that neither the current

director nor the incumbent DDO understand or perceive of what

counterintelligence actually is and what function it has, and

what the CIA's responsibility is for counterintelligence to

the nation. That is my personal opinión. They do not -- they

have not had experience in counterintelligence. They've never

worked in counterintelligence. And quite frankly, they do no:

understand the problems involved in counterintelligence.

Mr. Kirbow. Can you see this getting any better with

Probably knows the term counterintelligence, but knows nothing

about the intelligence community basically?

Mr. Miler. I don't -- quite frankly, I couldn't comment

on the current management and the current management of counter:

intelligence in the CIN, it is my view that he will get

complotely erroneous information and not have

make decisions which ultimately will be tragic to this

country as far as counterintelligence

is concerned, from

ignorance.

MI. Miler. What counterintelligence is, how it should

be organized, what the threat to the nation is that can be

hopefully countered by an effective counterintelligence organi-

agencies concerned.

to promote the best kind of a national program.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Assume something about, Mr.

Angleton mentioned earlier, about the tendency to sweep

penetrations under the rug in this country.

llas there been a pattern in the past that still prevails

of reluctance on the part of professional intelligence

officials as well as administration officials to admit that

we are susceptible to that?

Mr. Angleton..

well, I think there is no question that

there has been

a tremendous dishonesty

in facing up to hard

facts an intelligence.

I'11 take the Yom Kippur war as an example. As you know,

it was a complete failure in

terms of prediction. As I main-

tained in my testimony, if you cannot make a proper estimate

in a primitive area, then God help you when you come into the

Bloc area, and I still hold by that conviction.

But in that case, a few days prior to the Yom Kippur war,

the FBI disseminated a report to the President, the Secretary

of State, Defense and the Director of CIA which purported

be a discussion between Gromyko and a very senior source

to the effect that they

had given up on the Arabs, that they

would no longer

support the frags, they would no longer give

them arms, that they were going to recognize Israel, and

in

'fact they had the draft notes ready for the recognition of

Israel.

Now, I have never seen the post mortem of the whole project

on the estimation, but I would assume that any estimator who

received information by letter or memorandum, hand-carried,

quoting Gromyko, would tend to discount the fact that the Arabs

were about to attack Israel where they would have to depend on

Soviet arms, and therefore the question of the Yom Kippur war

would be out of the question. In other words, that one report,

I give it as an example.

Now, Independently a study group of the Joint Chiefs came

up with the whole question of soviet disinformation, strategic

disinformation to put us off balance on our estimating process..

Now, in our own Agency we were heavily frowned upon for

raising these questions, that there was a strong clement of

Soviet deception and disinformation that had been injected into.

the intelligence collecting program.

MI. Miler. Prior to the Yom Kippur war.

Mr. Angleton. Prior to that. But the important thing

is that that source who provided the Bureau with that infor-

mation has been providing information over a number of years,

but no one has made a study of information in hindsight in

order to evaluate that source.

And I could go into many more sensitive cases of where

again intention has come through a highly questionable source,

and yet there has been no rc-examination. There has been no

grouping or forum in which there can be any disputation. Each:

ware of such nature their analysts said it looks like there's

Joing to be a war within 24 hours. They, predicted the time.

They sent it over. It was immediately said, go back to bed.

Is that correct?

Mr. Angleton. All I know about it is the alleged part

of that. I remember the Pike Report that caused a great deal

of comment. I thought that the four magic words were that

NSA was not able to malie a contribution because the Egyptians

had gone into a high SIGINT alort.

In other words, that through SIGINT they couldn't learn

the intention. I don't know this fact that you are tabelling.

No. Miler. The point that we're trying to make in this

connection is part and parcel of Soviet espionage, Soviet

intelligence service activity and Soviet bloc intelligence

service activity is in the political field. It involves

deception and disinformation. A properly coordinated and run

counter-intelligence effort will bring research and analytical

work to hear which would give an analysis and an assessment

of che situation, which should be of value to policy-makers

have to have some knowledge of this in order to be ablo to

Me. Miller. So what you're saying is from mid-1973 on

the country, or at least the CIA has lost a valuable asset.

What happened in '73?

What was the decision?

Mr. Angloton. That's the recentralization, when all

of these components were taken away

from us, including the

liaison and whatnot, includiny international communist partios.

So this completely viscerated the counter-intelligence

as we have built it up

since 1954.

So it serves a useful purpose. But it's not -. I

wouldn't give it 20 percent credibility. Now the Office of

Security probably gives'it 70 or maybe higher.

Mir. digenova. Mr. Angleton, the point you made of the

lach: of study of traffic which followed the deception in the

cable traffic, as I understand it, you're saying that there's

been no analysis that you're aware of since that time done of

of

everything since then.

'Ir. Angleton. There's never been any analysis ever.

Mr. digenova. Is the current research set-up which ci

staff now has which is oriented toward instant studies, quote

inquote, to provide data for ongoing operations inconsistent

with wanting to achieve that sort of goal, like analyzing that

data?

Mr. Angleton. Nell, I don't know what that really means,

instant analysis. I mean we've always done Instant analysis.

Mr. diGenova. I know that but it's our understanding,

we've learned from the Agency that there has been a movement

away from in-depth historical research toward more current

sort of analyses.

What you're suggesting to me by saying that there's

been no analysis done of those cables is that we've lost a

valuable CI tool since that study hasn't been done, and I'd

like to know if your assessment of the current trend toward

research is a bad one?

Mr. Angleton. I think 1ü makes no sense whatsoever.

Mr. Miler. It's disastrous. It will lead to complete

chaos within a very short time because you're trying to analyse

an individual case without having the ability to relate 40

other cases to that case.

Mr. diGenova. Theré's no integration in other words.

• Mr. Miler. That's right and you cannot operate in a

vacuum.

Mr. Angleton, We have learned from one defector, the

one of Necember '61 a complete new understanding of what

happened from the days of Lenin.

That is not in the public record. A complete new

picture of the growth of the OGPU and of the Cheka. And in

We rean a seminar using the highest talent that we had and

revealing as much information as we could conceivably reveal.

And so our whole mental attitude was that counter-intelli-

gence, one of its highest priorities is the defense of its

own forces. And I'm not going to justify the mail program at

this time, but some day I'll justify it in print or otherwise

because it represents only .00l percent of mericans - a,

small coterie of Americans who wrote to the Soviets when we

had troops in the field on two occasions, and our primary

duty was the support of those troops.

So that background Scotty can tell you but the rolationshi

we've had with the military.

ir. Miler. Hell, the relationships with the counter-

intelligence with the military have varied. I would say that

for the most part it has been reasonably good, it has been

perhaps better in Washington than it has been in the field.

With few excentions CIA field representatives have not been

terribly concerned with conducting counter-intelligence. They

have not cooperated to the extent that the military commanders

in the field have wanter.

Some of this has to do with priorities that are impose:

on the CIA representatives fron Washington. Some of it has

to do with lack of manpower. Sone of it has to do with the

fact that in the opinion of many of the CIA operatives, the

sens in particular, to a lesser extent the other services,

have not undertaken counter-Intelligence activities which are

of a high enough level to justify the time and attention,

particularly of senior CIA representatives abroad.

It is, I think, also a bit of a problem because the

priorities of military counter-intelligence

In many instances

do not parallel or support CIA's priorities. They have the

responsibility for the protection of their installations and

there have also been imposed on the military the requirement

to build assets, what we term double agents which the military

term controlled foreign assets, as a contingency for possible

deception use.

Traditionally, also, the CIA, and in recent years thir

has been quite true, the CIA field oporatives have wanted to

exploit military counter-intelligence assets for what is

termod aggressive positive intelligence or recruitment attempts

of the enemy agent or officer who was controlling the double

agent of the controlled foreign asset.

There has been traditionally a problem of coordination

between the military services, the CIA, and the FBI on double

agent operations.

I think: overall this has vorked reasonably voll, given

the fact that -- in particular, for example, the system of

chain of command in the Army is a very confused one and is not

easy to put your finger on. There are various echelons and!

reporting procedures and so forth.

From the counter-intelligence staff standpoint, in

particular what I was concerned with was an attempt to make

sure that there was a full integration. You see, under the

operating procedures and the responsibilities, the military

services are required to advise the CIA of its activities,

counter-intelligence and so forth abroad. In turn, they

advise the FBI of their counter-intelligence activities and

SO

forth here in the United States.

So you have, when

an activity here in the United States,

the individual involved, the double agant, the controlled

foreign asset transfers abroad, then there is a transfer of

coordination and vice versa.

MI. Angleton. I'd like to inject this. There is

concurrent jurisdiction sinco the double is usually an American

citizen.

So regardless of where he is, we would always persuade

the Army or whoever it is, to notify the Bureau through their

own channel because you're dealing with Americans, so

geography is not really the important element..

Mr. Miler.

From

a counter-intelligence standpoint,

it has had, there have been some problems as a result of that

in terms of the regular CIA representation abroad. There is

a means of working together with

the military services and

so forth in terms of notifying each of the services, each of

the agencies of the potential for deception feeding and

Mr. Johnson. Does the CIA have veto powers over military

proposed double-agents?

Mr. Miler. No, not the veto power.

MI. Angleton. Well, it never really comes up to a veto.

But if we took a stand against it and supplied reasoning that

made sense, they would go along the way that we wanted. We've

never had a head-on collision.

Mr. Miler. There would oftentimes be differences in the

ffeld, that would be presented through the proper channels,

say from the Army back to the ACSI

from our field station

to headquarters. And then there would be a discussion and a

resolution at the lashington level.

iow obviously, in any kind of a situation like that,

there have been instances where, you, know, there was bad

feelings and misunderstandings and so forth. But I think that

overall, at least in my experience in the way we try to

conduct the business was that it was mutually beneficial.

Now the military sorvices have complained to me because

Agency on double agents to the military services and so forth,

that we were not as forthcoming in providing them information

about our possihle assets and so forth as they were.

a source or an asset in which to fulfill the requirement.

But for security and compartmentation reasons, not exclusively

duc to the counter-intelligence concerns but also to the

general security and operations procedures of the Agency as

a whole, there was a reluctance to put this information forward

except when and as needed.

Mr. Anglaton. And there's another point that has to be

raised here. That is when you get into the field of deception

you are bound by certain charters. Those charters have not

been approved at the highest policy level. So there's been

a great deal of tactical military cover and deception.

Our interest is more on the strategic deception, and

that paper has been resting with DI. Kissinger for some 2 1/2

years or more for approval.

Mr. Miler. Three.

Mr. Angleton. Three years.

So that is bogged down a great deal of the whole overall

deception program.

Mr. Maxwell. The paper that is in front of Dr. Kissinger

now makes what deceptions?

Mr. Angleton. It was a paper that was pulled together

by the Joint Chiefs, ourselves, and the FBI.

MI. Maxwell. And It proposes what?

Mr. Angleton. It outlines

procedures for strategic

deceptions, political deception and other deception.

Mr. Johnson. Could you givo a brlet example of the CIA

role in strategie decoption, a specific example?

MI. Angleton.

No, I can't.

I mean I could get into

cases but it's too vague. It's always been something that

has been arrived at ad hoc and it served the purpose, but I

wouldn't call it strategic.

MI. Miler. No program, in other words.

Mr. Angleton. In other words, the proper strategic decep-

tion would be the President calls in the Director and says, no

one knows that in three months I'm going on the following trip.

I will have meetings with the following people. I'm not

going to announce it until a week before I leave.

So it gives you a time span of two months to use

all of

your sources to put across disinformation or information, a

letter in the mailbox to the proper addressee that, you know,

favor his role or favor his mission and helps him out. And

that's what we are trying to seek and have been trying to seck

for a long time. But there has to be a way of knowing what

are some of the intentions of the government in order to

advance it through disinformation or deception.

1r. Miler. With respect to the military, if I may

return to that, I think that one of the - probably the greatert

difference and failure with respect to CIA counter-intelligenc

relationships with the military

was

Mr. diGenova. Would that be the only instance of which

you are familiar that there was in fact knowledge of an operatind

within the continental United States?

MI. Angleton. Offhand I can't say because the Office of

Security would be working with the Bureau, usually. I mean to

say that saT are the most likely people to have contracts with

a number of contractors and companies.

It would be office

of security's joh.

just thought that maybe in the course of your counter-intellige

a company operating in the United States

which was being used, not to contract with the Agency but to

contract or just do anything, whether it was a bookkeeping

firm or a law firm or anything, and was in fact engaged in

of such a thing is outside the purview of the CIA unless it is

abroad, unless it would he funded through switzerland or Luxem-

Soviet money was being put in and they had representation here.

Mr.. direnova. Well, the staff has been given information

that these analyses are done by CI research personnel or

proprietary companies of foreign intelligence services, ani

either that information is wrong or we just do not understand

each other.

and makes them somewhat vulnerable as a result of that.

Turning the coin around a little bit and looking at our

selves, are the computerized systems which we now have in our

country which put in ia. central location large amounts of

information about individual citizens and large groups of

citizens, making us vulnerable to penetration in terms of

information, more vulnerable in terms of penetration by

foreign counter-intelligence services?

Mr. Angleton. Vulnerable in what sense?

Mr. diGenova. Getting information about us, period,

which I understand

is one of the key goals of counter-intelligence,

finding out what the other side is doing.

Mr. Angleton. You mean surreptitiously getting it fron

us or officially getting

•it from us?

Mr. direnova. Both. The fact of the matter is the

information exists and it's vulnerable for them to have it,

is it vulnerable for us to have it?

Ple. Angleton. Hell, I wouldn't put it down as vulnerable

because when anyone males a request or you for information,

the first question is why. so the hurden

is on them to justifi

that they have a counter-espionage reason for asking for that

and they tell you about the entire Bulgarian business. And

so we start an investigation as to Bulgarian antecedents or

anything dealing with Bulgaria, et cotera. And 11 1t'g

justified, we give them the information.

MI, dicenova. Well, I don't think, Mr. Angleton, that's

not what I'm getting at.

We as a country are amassing properly, quote, unquote,

large amounts of information about ourselves through the use

of computer systems.

?1r. Angleton.

That's right.

Mr. diGenova. The CIA tells us that that is one of the

things they like so much about foreign countries, because the

totalitarian regimes have the tendency to amass large amounts

of information about their citizenry and when we penetrato

and get that information, that helps us.

My question is when we do that, when we centralize the

information hy using our own computer systens, no matter where

it is, do we help them?

And in this regard I would note that in 1970 the Inspector

reneral's report on the question of cover noted that the fact

that credit bureaus in this country were amassing so much

information about people, incluiling CIA personnel, that it

Now the question I raise 1a are we cutting off our nose

to spite our face by using computars to really marshall together

largo amounts of evidence which can be made accessible to

foreign powers either by surreptitiously or by simply openly

getting it?

HI. Miler. Yes, the answer is yes.

Mr. digenova. Good.

Mr. Miler.

Because

it's very easy to get this informationi.

And, for examole, the Soviets have had, you can confirm this

fron the Dureau, have had a systematic systen of purchasing

from the state of Maryland, the District of Columbia, the

State of Virginia, the business directories, residence

directories, license directories for less than 9350 apiece.

Mr. Johnson. If we're going to keep on our schedule,

we've got a witness who's supposed to be here at 3:30, so

is there a final question?

Mr. Kirbow. I have two questions.

isecaune of the

vast years of experience, Mr. Chairman, that we should ast:

then to comment on, and either one of you all should ansiver.

"hat do you all consider today to he the major threats

to

this country? And

the second

question is, what has been

the major foreign covert action program directed against this

country in your lifetime and experience in the Agency?

MI. Angleton. Wall, I think, no question, it's the

Soviet bloc services that represent the major threat because

they are really a small, they are directly subordinated to the

central committee and to the hasic objectives, as I've seen the:!

all my life to the change and balance of military power.

Further, that practically all intelligence operations more!

and more have political objectives, and I think it is the fact

that since '59 they have elevated the Cuban intelligence and

all of the other bloc services to a very high degree of

efficiency, that they

are coordinated and they work as eguals.

And I think that is the major threat, that is the

inability of the FBI by lack of personnel and manpower to be

able to cover these people.

There isn't the minimal coverage.

The

people they cover are people who have been "identified,"

and I defy anyone to have a list of identified agonts in this

country.

Now that is the legal side of it. Now the larger part

of it is the illegal, where there's been little or no success.

The only one that has really come out is the Abel case, which

tandled through lanahar and then there was one of two

minor ones.

But that is a whole program of bloc activity, and

according

to one of the best sources we had, his view was that

the illegals rould be placed primarily in airports, dochs,

factories, and they give a whole listing. And these are the

Now the illegal directorate represents a very major part

of Soviet intelligence and bloc intelligence and we just --

thera are not successes. It's just happenstance.

Mr. Epstein. It's disruption of our defense effort?

Is that what you're speaking of now?

Their goal being

disruption of this country's defense effort?

Mr. Angleton. Well, they have many assignments. But

the point is they have also the sabotage assassination part.

it raises questions in everybody's mind when there is sabotage

activities and you cannot find the

Leninism. They have rededicated themselves to the shift in

the military balance of power. They have reinstituted, in

effect, what was the policy of the NEP period, the New Economic

Policy, the attraction of Western business, the attraction of

Western capital into the Soviet Union to bolster the soviet

Union, the disruption of the economies of other nations, which

would have an adverse effect on the economy of this nation --

all of this centrally controlled and directed, used through

such countries as romania, where we have for several years now

deluded ourselves that Romania is independent, through Bulgaria,

through llungary, through Poland, all the rest of it.

This is the major threat to the United States. Counter-

intelligence is probably, in my view, at least, one of the

major ways that you're going to be able to counter this and

at least get the information hrought to the attention of the

people who are making the decisions and making the policy

Mr. Miler. In other words, how significant in the fact

then, how significant would it be lf our congress, our Executive

and our business people knew that as of 1974 the last figures

I have of 187 Soviets identified with the USSR all union

chamber of commerce, the people that are doing all of the

business with our businessmen who are coming here to the United

States, work them and so forth, when 47 of those were appointed

to that from the KGB.

I mean, what significance does this have to the United

States ?

Senator Schweiker. 47 out of how many?

!Ir. Miler. About 182.

MI. Angleton. Let's no to the scientific side on this.

The scientific side, in May of 1969 the central committee

ordered that there be added 2,000 staff officers to KGB from

the Academy of Sciences in order to exploit the opening to the

dest

and the scientific levels.

HIr. Epstein. And how would that exploitation be

accomplished?

Mr. Angleton.. For recruitment and exploitation of

contacts

in, the West in the scientific exchanges.

Mr. Epstein. The goal heing espionage of something also?

Mr. Angleton. Espionage.

Mr. Milar. Espionage and influence. How many KGB

officers?

Mr. Angloton. In 1961, 1000 of those had been pulled

together. There was a briefing given by the general staff to

high kan people regarding the field of military electronics,

and during that briefing it was pointed out that they were 14

years behind us, but they would overcome and surpass us through

thrce means: Ilumber one

was the Central Committee adding the

2,000 staff officors for espionage; Second would be disinfor-

mation loading our scientific efforts in the wrong directions;

And third was to enter into those kind of treaties which would

bind our own scientific progress in military fields.

When I left the Agency, I read a report by a man who

knew nothing of this lecture, and this was a group of American

electronic experts who had made a very sensitive, Top Secret

study which stated that in this field the Soviets were four

years behind us.

This was in 1974.

NI. Epstein. A final question. In the last 10 or 15

years have you exporienced any situations where any hostile

nowers were

involved in covert action against the election

process

in this country?

1I. Angleton. Well, I think there's no question that

influence has heen hrought to hear.

Mr.. Inderfurth. How?

No. ingleton. I don't think it figuros unless it woulr

But just to add one last point to this question of the

threat, it is my view, seeing Ingola and seeing the unwilling...

ness of this country to resist or to define its purpose, or

to deal falrly with its allies, that within a period of four

years there will be a form of confrontation on

an unpopular

issue between the soviet bloc and

the United States in which

we will back down. He will then go into our suprene isolation.

detail that one of the primary purposes of the reorientations

vas that all intelligence operations or political objectives,

and the main political objective was to reaffirm the United

States as the main enemy, to achiove its isolation and to achieve

political hegemony over most of Afiica and Latin America.

when I took him to many: countries we talked on higher levels

than we could talk in the United States. And I took him to

some countries that we could talk to Prino Ministers. I have

seen Prime Ministers and have been able to expose this. Dut

the machinery here is not of such a nature that you can get

into these matters.

Mr. Epstein. Are they disseminated?

Mr. Angleton. We're nos going to dissominate.. These

are matters that should go to the Secretary of State. They

it went to many other people. But whether it actually got to

the

Secretary of State, I do not know.

Mr. Miler. I think one important point here that I

would like to make is that what has happened, in my opinion

what has happened in counter intelligence in the Agency and

the so-called aggressive operations, the increase in double

agent operations and

so forth and the dispersal of the centralise.

counter-intelligence is not going to produce a counter-

intelligence program within the CIA which is going to focus

on attempting to provide the government, policy-makers and

so forth, with the lind of information and analytical product

that is necessary if we're going

to have a successful counter-

intelligence.

Mr. Johnson. I would like to thank the witnesses, and

unless Senator Schweiker has any questions, we will adjourn

for five minutes.

Is that accoptable?

Thank you very much.

Senator Schveilcr.

Thank you very much.
