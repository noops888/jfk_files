COBB ebout Mr. DANIELS, COBB advised that
she was contacted by ALEXANDRIA who said,
"You know my iriend - I never mentioned his

agreed that ALEXANDRIA had net mentioned her
friend's name. ALEXANDHIA went on to say,
“But he is very concerned. Someone called

him from Washington and said that someore
reported him to-his superiors and he asked me -
(ALEXANDRIA) to whom T had mentioned his
name." COBB advised that ALEXANDRIA szated
that she could not believe that she had mentioned -
isname to anyone. =~ id

ALEXANDRIA also advised COBB that ker friend
in CIA had obtained a position for her in Tom
Dooley's organization, Medico,

5. The above informaticn and chronolugical ordar of
events would appezr to have definitely established the fact in
ALEXANDPIA's mind that June COBB is in contact with personnel
of CIA. It was definitely confirmed in COBB’s mind that the

~ undersigned end her-ease oificer, birs. Pearson, were CIA.

. 6 Mr, DANIELS advised that he had first met Diana
ALEXANDRIA in May 1960 as the result of a confidential FBI
lead, inasmuch as Mr. DANIELS was attemptiny to develop
informstion regarding Fidel Castrs's life.

7, Mr. DANIELS confirmed that he has been in regular
contact with ALEXANDRIA since May 1960. He has asserted
that he advised ALEXANDRIA only that June CCBB was "clean"
and this reference to ALIIXANDRIA meant only, as far as he |
was concerned, that COEB wes physicslly a clean person and
that she would be a good roommate for ALEXANDRIA,

8. Mr. DANIELS advised that he did question ALEXANDRIA
as to whether or not she had mentioned his nzree & anyone.

9, Tt, therefore, appears that the events which hava
taken place have been corfirmed. The degree of security implication
cannot be presently determined. In other words. ALEXANDRIA's
discussions with personalities unknown reaarding June CCBB
is a big question, The possibilities of ALEXANDRIA's discussions

with Cuban nationals is most likely since she is in contact with i

reany of them in the New York area.
10. Mr. DANIELS further advised that ALEXANDRIA

expects to depart New York City for San Diego during the week aaa

of 24 October. ‘It appears that she plans to make a permanent
chenge in her residence, Mr. DANIELS ‘urther advised that
he did obtain employment for ALEXANDRIA in Medico but that
she had resigned from this position during the week 17 October.
