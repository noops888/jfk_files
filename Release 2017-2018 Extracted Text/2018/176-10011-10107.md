SPECIAL HANDLING

CONSIDERATIONS

Due to local conditions and problems, the

Debriefing Center will continue to

be more limited in size and selective in

choice of refugees than Opa-locka. This

is primarily an NSA problem but CIA will

continue to assist as practicable.

PAA requires financial assistance to con-

tinue this activity.

It is recognized that significant increase in

coverage of the internal micro-wave system

would become a major budget and personnel

problem.

This is done on a regular basis by FBIS.

This will be handled through existing

liaison channels.
