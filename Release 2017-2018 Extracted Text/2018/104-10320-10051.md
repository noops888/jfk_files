SUBJECT: Lee Harvey Oswald Case: Briefing of Coneressman
Richard Ichord, § May. 1972

1, Mr. Joseph O'Neill, Office of ‘the Legislative
Counsel, presented Mr. Arthur Nooley, o furnished the
exnibits requested by the Congressman, and answered his
questions as follows:

2. Mr. Ichord ssid he was concerned over one aspect
of the Oswald Invest: zation From the standpoint of his
committee. He wanted to know if “during CIA's investigation
of Oswald when he was in Mexico" we developed any evidence -
of a conspiratorial relationshin between the Soviets and
Osvaldeither through our coverage of the Embassv or
outside meetings. He specifically referred to Soviet
consular officials Pavel Antonovich Yatskov and Valeriy
Vladimirovich Kostikov, one or both of whom Oswald
contacted at the Soviet Embassy, (Both Yatskov and Kostikov
were identified in the Commission's Report as consular
officials and KGB representatives.) I told him that CIA
did not have Oswald under investigation when he was in
Mexico City; directed his attention to the pertinent
exhibit; and explained that the KGB affiliations of the
two Soviets were Supplied by CIA exnerts who were aware
of their activities and not by anything said or indicated
by Oswald in the evidence compiled by us. Mr. Ichord
examined the exhibit, noted that Oswald's short conversations
only related to securing visas; indicated that he had been
misinformed; and said that he had no further questions to
ask on this point.

3. He said that his question was snarked by Bernard

Fensterwald, Jr. a former constituent, about whom he

zs knew very little when he requested the documents. Since
then he has learned of Fensterwald's dubious credentials
as an expert on the assassination and of his association
with Jim Garrisson and others of questionable repute,
I detailed our own difficulties with Fensterwald, his
insistence that we are hiding something, and how, as
Executive Director of the Committee to Investigate
Assassinations, he has been pressing us to release our
Classified documents under threat of invoking the
Freedom of Information Act.

4, At Mr. Tchord's requost,’ I gave him a conolete
riadown on hoy CIA learned of Csvalil's presence in M xico,
and the circumstances surroundin? the pnoto of the
tmknown man which was taken in front of the Soviet Unbassy.
T snecified and refuted the assorted allegations regarding
this nicture which were cenerated by Edvard Epstein,

“esley Liebeler (a former Cornission attorney), Mark Lane,
Jim Garrisson, and iater Bernard Fensterwald,:JrviI
nentioned that Fensterwald told us-a year.ago that he
knew the identity of the unknown man -hut so far has not
volunteered his name. One of Garrisson's charges was that
Cswald was a CIA agent and that we cut him out of .the
picture. I took the occasion to stress that Oswald was
not a CIA agent and that we never had anything to do with
hin.

5. I mentioned that when the President's Commission
came into existence Mr. Nelms issued specific instructions
to cooperate fully with the Commission and to give it
complete access to any information bearing on the assassina-
tion; that Commission members, at Mr. Helm's invitation
visited our Mexico City station for an on-the-scene
briefing and inspection. I told him that we have not’
released exhibits relating to Oswald's visits to the Soviet
and Cuban Embassies, because the sources of the above
information are extremely sensitive and still productive,
Mr. Ichord fully’ agreed on this score and complimented us
ea the extent of our coverage.

6. Mr. Ichord asked what steps CIA was taking to
declassify its other documents. I told him of the required
five year cycle (one coming up shortly), the review ne
process, our interim releases, and CIA's desire to release i i
them all _as quickly as the need for protecting them subsides,

I pointed out that most of our material consists of "nut
complaints", rumors, gossip, etc; which have no security
stienificance ner se but could be embarassing to innocent
persons; disclose a productive and friendly foreign source;
or acknowledge CIA's presence abroad where diplomatically
this would be inadvisable. I cited_our experience with the
“crank call" that originated in how

in 1968 we tried to declassify eee exnibit™put |
security officials objected on the grounds that Tt wou

publicly acknowledge CIA presence on their soil and perhaps
stir unwarranted controversy. /I stated that despite the
above-type problems we gradually have been declassifying

7. I mentioned in passing, that two'other things:
beyond our control have contributed to the ‘misconceptions
over our exhibits: A)The inadvertent release “by: National
‘Archives of the master list of numberec..exhibits shortly
after the demise of the President's. Commission without ~~
distinguishing between overt and classified items: ‘and
B) the fact that many exhibits bear different numbers 5
but are interrelated, thus giving a false:impression that’
there are more. exhibits than is the case.) The-release 0°)!
of the master list without the accompanying: documents cae
caused much apprehension and misinterpretation, particularl
among assassination "buffs" and Asency critics. -I.cited
the "Oswald and the U-2" entry which was widely exploited
until we declassified the document a couple of years ago..

8. Mr. Ichord asked if any. CIA members served. on -
the President's Commission. I said no, but mentioned that »
former DCI Allen Dulles was on the Commission. He then
turned to the makeup of the Commission staff and how it
was chosen. I replied that we were not really competent =
to comment on how it was chosen but the staff consisted
largely of attorneys of varied political and ethnical
backgrounds from widely separated parts of the country;
that, from my observation, the Commission was impressively
organized and a highly motivated, hard working group.

9. Mr. Ichord stated that he had no further questions
to ask and thanked us for easing his mind. We offered to
produce any other documents he might wish to see. Mr. Ichord
replied that this would not be necessary. He returned our
exhibits and told us to consider the matter closed,
