have been done spontaneously. Julieta’ Bays; that his: (OSWALD's) death

follows: #) Confront Silvia with Nic and have Nic inform her of details his statement

position as OSWALD prior to his assassinations her only chance for survival is to come
clean with whole story and to cooperate completely with Mexi Gov in return for Mexi Gov

: : : : : i ODENVY will be advised, ‘Since my cable of yesterday. (MEXI. 7072 -. para 97 above) there have
: : : / been three principal developments: 1). Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 hrs last evening called
i : i ; : i : DORTICOS of Cuba, In this conversation, which like the first is taped, DORTICOS' expressed

i ' i ' continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia about money. |
2) ALVARADO, the Nic, was questioned by CAS officer: util two a.m. this morning. This |
officer was impressed by ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a witness and
who is now hiding in place provided by CAS.: We ‘cannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety. Wealth
of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities invol: ith OSWALD in Cub Emb
is striking, 3) At 1215 hrs Mexi time 27 Nov., CAS office ised by phone ‘by :
ECHEVERRIA that he had rearrested Silvia today because he le = she was attempting to
leave Mexi for Habana, However, Echeverria later told LEG, Mthat he had decided to rearrest
Silvia to avoid any ‘possibility she might escapt to Cuba gné yater be unavailable as a
witness, Since we had received no reply to yesterday's eleprem (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above )
we have not requested Mexi gov to take g any action agafnd RtSSilvia except to maintain
increased surveillance of her activities, Echeverria eter denied to LEGAT that he had any
specific concrete evidence that she was about to nea fr Cuba. We do not now know which
Echeverria statements are accurate, It is quite pogsible, and even probable, that contra-
dictory statements made by Echeverria ere explaing byp"desire of GOM to play down importance
of OSWALD visit here, Mexi line still is that OSWALD Visit related solely to visa question,
Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGA ai” DORTICOS only interested in finding :
out whether Mexi authorities tried to pay as fron Silvia, This is obviously incrorrect
interpretation, Neither LOPEZ Mateor nor Ee aia know of ALVARADO's story. Pls note
that according Echeverria Silvia is being t: bo Attorney General's office to which
Mexi press has easy access. Possiblity of ga heas corpus cannot be discounted, 4) We
have as yet found no trace of the red he. edsCub negro described by ALVARADO, but are
continuing our search for him. 5) In on to questions raised in yesterday's telegram
Washington should urgently consider feasib ity of requesting Mexi authorities to arrest
for interrogation; Eusebio AZCUE; Luisa CALDERCN and Alfredo MIRABAL. The two men are
Cuban nationals’ and Cuban consular officers, Luisa CALDERON is a de secretary in Cuban :
consulate here.: In this connection article II of Consular Convention between U, S, and Mexi
exempts from arrest "Consuler officers, national of the state by which they are appointed,
and not engaged in any private occupation for gain" except "when charged with the commission
: : : of an act designated by local legislation as crime other than misdemeanor and subjecting
; . : ' the individual guilty thereof to punishment by imprisoamnt." We are checking to see whether
: all of these individuals are on current consular list. Even assuming they are, and assuming

Mexi, Monterrey and Laredo, but is not permitted to sell tickets or pick up passengers at

of its records and procedures and:has now arrived at the conclusion that the person designated
as--"OSWLD"-on--the--2-Oct- 63 passenger manifest-did-not- purchase a ticket and- could not have

for tickets. /* According to Mr. LOZANO, a’ reservation is recorded by assigning a seat
numberas available and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination
of the individual requesting the. reservations, That reservation is respected under normal
conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event all seats are not
filled, it may be held until'the actual departure of the’ bus. Prior to the departure of
the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that
particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communicates by radio to the company
headquarters in Monterrey the number of “paying" passengers on the bus in relation to the
Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tickets. / Francisco ALVARADO,
ticket salesman and dispatcher for Transportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of
the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name “OSWLD" and destination "Lared"
appear opposite Seat No. 4. ‘He stated that he did not write the “OSWLD" reservation info
and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and ow fo recorded by the
baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ, ALVARADO is quite certain at t msent time that the
individual designated on the list as “OSWLD" did not purchas cket and did not travel
on the trip relating to that manifest, No ticket number was rded-for that person, and
a@ search of the company's records in Monterrey had failed fos te a ticket stub which
was not otherwise accounted for in connection with that parttcnlar trip. / The notations
by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, 7 Monterrey" reflected that he, ported by radio to the
Monterrgy office of the company that the bus had separa h nine "paying" passengers
for Laredo and seven "paying" passengers destined for Monterrey, Listed under "Name of
Passengers" were "OSWLD" with no ticket number, indica: he did not travel; "Angel PEREZ"
with no ticket number or destingtion, which confi t+ he had not purchased a ticket
and had not boarded the bus; and "Nicolas GONZALEZ} *% ‘No, 10, listed as having traveled
on a pass to Torreon. /.,./- ALVARADO and Gilber€® ANO stated that the notations on
the back of the manifest referred to advances ofefuiidé made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the
cash for repairs, parts or other requirements, & related that the passenger lists

are not kept as a permanent record, and, whe fanifest was located in the "trash"

at the request of investigators of the Mexi ntial Staff, the Blanks at the tope

of the form had not been filled in as to ti stination, trip number, bus number, and
date, but they had completed those blanks heir personal knowledge in order to make
that data clear to the investigators. - The fo had listed the names of the drivers on the

of the document had been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document
vas borrowed from them. / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection of
Lu. S.OSWALD,-ete......they could offer no explanation as to how Mexican authorities had arrived
at the conclusion that OSWALD had travelled on the Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Cct 65, -
but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had not been given

OSWALD at a party at home of her cousin Ruben DURAN when‘
assassination. / Elena said Carlos SOLORZANO is well acq 'd with Cub Amb HERNANDEZ
Armas, and that he was not leftist but his brother, Alfgnsd} was a Communist. Amb HERANDDEZ
told SOLORAANO he wanted to meet Elena, so SOLORZANO Ge da party at his own homa on

30 June 66 and invited both of them, Also present yfelePito MONIEROSO and his wife;
Elvira VARGAS, leftist journalist with NOVEDADES gersonal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;
Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin, tanedo, head of publishing firm
called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORTANO, pa: ho was invited to make her feel at
ease, since he is a friend of hers and was th: anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening, Amb HERNAND®Z, whom she dg€c das intelligent and cultured, concen-
trated his attention on her..... and exp: interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He issued a personal invitation to her t hd the annual literary festival of the Casa

de las Americas in Havana, She said she not a Fidelista and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present...../ Later, her friend,

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned her not to go to Cubs alone.
/ On k July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre in

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and sone printed matter from the Casa

de las Americas in Havana. The first letter, written last October (667) gave her address

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written. in April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

---Rbe envelope forthe first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

‘sender, which was the Cub Emb here, The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments. / Elena stated the _-

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was because she spent severel 4323
days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination. The correct address of the hotel is 4 of >
Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor PAGE - —
error, as her regular address. / Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensibly to COPY NO+ -cnennuemmemnn™
