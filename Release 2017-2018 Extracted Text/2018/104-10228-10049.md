Amount and method of payments to dependents in

by Humphrey 0, TIMANUS, According to the question-
naire filled out by lst dependent, father of Munuel

that tho present Trustee, another sister, nasume

1961-1965 since the new trustecship was not created
until much of the money had been spent. In order to
protect the intorests of the prisoner, some procedure
will probably be devised by which a long-range

this case will bo subwitted to JMWAVE in the near

3. In order to arrive at tho exact umount of money to
be gavod by tho immediate and future termination of payments
to certain dependents, a definite criteria mist be established
concerning adjustments for sucondary depondents when the
first depondent has been terminated, In discussions between
#ilen F, MARGANY,” during her recent TDY to JMWAVE, and
Mumphrey 0, TIMANUS, it was MARGANY's uuderstanding that the
Procedure 1s to raise the second dependent to the status
of firat dependent when the original first dependent ig
terminated for cause, For oxumple, the first child would
receive the amount originally paid to the mother, instead
of the customary $50 paid to a second dopendont, and the third
dependent would thén become the. second dependent and receive
$50 instead of the original $25. This procedure was not
folloved in case # 44 where tho second dependent payment
remained at $50 after the remarriage of the mother, Case
# 25 where child, now sole dependent, does not receive full
Ist dependent payment, nor in the contentious CUERVO-RUBIO
case (# 54) where an attempt to hold tho second dependent
to $50 precipitated considerable unpleasantness. lowever,
in cago # 86, the procedure of raising the payment level
of the second and third dependents aftor the remrriage of
the mother, was followed, Logically, the terminntion of
payments to dependents in any of the top categories would
autowatically lead to an adjustment in status and payment
to not only children, but in somo cases parents as well,
depending on their position of inheritance. A clarification
of Station's past proceduro, any known comaittments to
Gependents, and present views as to firm criteria to be
followed in such cases is urgently. requested. Not only is
such a fixed criteria. nucesaary to determine the amount of
savings involved in tho recommended immediate termination,
and to provide accurate long-range figures for tho actuary
study, but also for the purpose of avoiding any possible
repercussions such as occurred in the CUERVO-RUBIO case,
