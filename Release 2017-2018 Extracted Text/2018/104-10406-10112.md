OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the dela (by the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book asa
case of lazinss on the part of the Soviet case officer (thich
in ny view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October
convers ation would have been. picked up on the morning-<0f€ the
2nd of October. ‘he Russian language portion would:havegone
to the Russian/English transcriber on the 3rd tober. ‘The
trans lation would have been returned the follawing-,
at which time, the Soviet case officer woykd haneris ked for
the photographic coverage. ‘That coverage 1a not have been
in the station before the 7th since th m was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and i4¢\as ‘picked up probably on
the 4th, processed and-pass ed tation on the next work
day which would have been M YQ ectober.

De

3. Later the film was \tWken out of the camera every day
but at that time, the film stayed in the camera until a full
rotl was completed which might take three or four dys.

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is
of the name alone but that wasn't the way Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telerhone coverage . .sometimes_there_.was..a U.S. automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of
justifying a project ly the number of dis patches, cables or
Teports produced.

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or $ months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly this man
(the American), “: showed him a letter in which he“(the
American) is a member of an organizatidh: im.favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not give*fint the visa without
the Russian visa and now the ot goesn't know what to do
with him, because he roe r the answer from
Washington.

DURAN: ..with them also, bet othe oblen with him (the Anerican)
is that he doesnt} Rhisyine in Cuba and in that case it
is very diff} ve him a visa, because he was
thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take ‘along time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~" ngw in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can-only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't. know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Enbassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-tepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa infomtation..’First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soyiet Enbassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned out=td be the Military Attache) .
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthe address. After

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went.t@the&adtress to get the needed
information.)

Just after 1600 hours, ‘the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Enbassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved ‘the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. ‘The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her. name and
someone will Tetum the call. DURAN gives her nane and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

In view of recent reopening of the publicity regarding
Lee Harvey OSWALD and WOFACT evidence, Headquarters would
like to determine whether the Station still has on hand
the negatives from which the prints available at Headquarters
were made of the unidentified "mystery man" coming out of
both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies. If they are still
on file, it is requested that they remain so, and that they
be forwarded Headquarters for retention rather than
destroyed if the latter action is ever contemplated.
