wt : DAVID G. MARWELL

Biographical Information
\ a

On July 1, 1994, the Berlin Document Center (BDC) was transferred to the German
Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) marking the end of nearly 48 years of American control
of this unique organization. With an estimated 25 million Nazi-era personnel-related files,
the BDC was once a crucial source of evidence for the Nuremberg Trials and is today att
incalculably important source for the study of the Third Reich. The transfer also marked
the end of David Marwell’s tenure as Director of the BDC. 7

A well-trained scholar with a PH.D. in History, Marwell came to Berlin in 1988 from
the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), U.S. Department of Justice where ‘he-held the
position of Chief of Investigative Research. At OSI, he was involved in researching and
preparing cases against accused Nazi war criminals residing in the United States. In
addition, he was selected to participate in the Klaus Barbie Investigation (1983) and played
a major role in the Josef Mengele investigation (1985), both of which received
international attention.

In connection with the Joseph Mengele and Klaus Barbie investigations, Marwell was
in charge of assembling all relevant documentary evidence relating to any possible
connection between these individuals and U.S. institutions or personnel. The
investigations were two of the most unusual ever undertaken and through them he gained
siginificant experiences in the identifying and locating documentary resources. The former
Director of OSI, Allan A. Ryan, Jr., in his book Quier Neighbors: Prosecuting Nazi War
Criminals in America, described Marwell as “an experienced and careful historian who
could find documents in archives when no one else cot

When Marwell arrived at the Document Center, the institution had been rocked by a
scandal involving a significant theft of documents. The resulting focus on the Center
revealed that it had been neglected in many areas for many years and suffered from:an
outmoded administrative structure, a disaffected and undertrained staff and a lack of
professional guidance. It was Marwell’s job to bring the Center up to standard and prepare
it for turnover to the German government. ,,

The challenges facing Marwell were not only to manage a complex institution (with
an annual budget of eight million deutschmarks) and repair past deficiencies, but also to
define a future for an institution in transition. He prepared a “five year plan" for the BDC
that set five goals, developed a corresponding program to meet each goal, and designed a
system to monitor the progress. In achieving all of the goals, Marwell:

e Introduced computer technology (there was not a single computer at the
BDC when he arrived) and developed a sophisticated, integrated information
retrieval system that has been described as a model for archive
administration;

e Created a fully professional document conservation and restoration program;

¢ Developed a staff (50 Germans and 20+ Americans) that is better trained and *
far more responsible, flexible and creative than it had been;

TO BE A MEMBER OF THE
ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

1. Were any conditions, expressed or implied, attached to your
nomination to be a member of the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB)?

No.

2. Have you made any commitments with respect to policies or
programs affected by your role as a member of the ARRB? If so,
what are they? et

No.

3. Are there any issues involving the ARRB from which you may
have to disqualify yourself? If so, please explain.

No.

4. Have you been a party to any legal actions or administrative
proceedings pertaining to access to, or disclosure of, federal .
records on the subject of the assassination of President Kennedy?

No.

TE. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1. What particular qualifications and experience do you bring to
the role of being a member of the ARRB?

First, I have been a professional historian during most of my
adult life, specializing in the history of the presidency and the
history of United States diplomatic relations, and attaining
national standing and recognition. I believe that I have a well-
developed sense of historical objectivity.

Second, I served two terms as a member of the National
Historical Publications Commission to which I was appointed and
then reappointed by President Johnson. A chief function was to
arrange for the evaluation and. publication of collections of
documents with historical significance. I participated fully in
the activities of the NHPC and gained indispensible experience in
judging documentary work.

Third, as co-author of The Modern Researcher (which has been
described as the "classic guide to research and writing” and

1

V-d75S3 List sPe Pani #76



13-00000

.? 4
which now is in its Fifth Edition and its thirty-sixth year of

publication), I have a keen sense of the mathods and needs of

researchers.

2. What do you consider to be your primary responsibilities and “ -
priorities as an ARRB member?

My first responsibility is to help establish the determina-
tion of the Board to fulfill the purpose of the legislation
creating it.

The second is to help oversee the orderly and complete
gathering of the documents from the respective agencies holding
then. .

The first priority is to help structure the Board so tha’
the work can proceed expeditiously and efficiently. - oe

The second priority is to obtain the services of a know-
ledgeable and energetic Executive Director as soon as ‘possible.

3. How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities--
as an ARRB member-- to (a) the President, (b) the Congress, and
(c) other executive branch agencies?

(a) to the President: I will aim to the best of my ability
to meet the high expectations that President Bush enunciated upon
signing the Act creating the Board: to help burnish the reputa-
tion of the United States Government for trustworthiness. I will
be responsive to inquiries and suggestions that may emanate from
the White House, while keeping in mind that the Board’s own
integrity is the highest desideratun.

(b) to the Congress: I will aim to fulfill the purpose of
the legislation creating the Board. I will always be acutely
aware of the keen interest and concern that the Congress has
expressed from the beginning in the assassination itself and in é
the attendant issues that understanding it has generated both on 2
Capitol Hill and in the country at large. I will be responsive
to inquiries and suggestions that may emanate from the Congress,
while keeping in mind that the Board’s own integrity is the
highest desideratun.

(c) to other executive branch agencies: I will be respon-
sive to the special concerns that assembling the pertinent
documents may create. Still, I feel obliged to keep firmly in
mind that the Board's mission is the highest desideratun.

4. How do you view the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role
do you anticipate playing in the selection of ARRB Executive
Director and staff?

The Executive Director is central to the success of the
Board’s mission. He or she must be a person of judgment,

2

we?
The Executive Director is central to the success of the

Board’s mission. He or she must be a person of judgment,

principle, and energy, experienced in dealing with masses of

historical material and capable of comfortably delegating work to _
: gubordinates. The person must be history-minded as well as ’
* capable of administering jestly and effectively an enterprise

that will be substantial size and enduring in its impact on

the nation’s. The Executive Director must be aware from the

outset that he or she will have to be in regular contact with the

Board on all vital issues arising out of the work. 7

I would expect to have a part in interviewing prospective
nominees for the post, and then in helping to instruct the person -
selected as to his or her responsibilities. As to the staff, I
assume that the Executive Director will have a comparatively. free
hand in the selection of subordinates in order to guarantee the. |
ultimate responsibility of the Executive Director for the eee
thoroughness of the undertaking. I would expect to be consulted
on nominees for staff positions as significant issues arise.

TIL. POLICY ISSUES

1. Have you made any public statements-- oral or written--
regarding the assassination of President Kennedy or the public
availability of government records regarding this assassination?
Please explain, and provide copies of any relevant material.

I was interviewed by the Scarsdale Inquirer in the week after
President Clinton announced his intention to nominate me to the
ARRB. I offered some innocuous remarks toe the reporter, which
were not set down with complete accuracy. (I know, for exanple,
and so said, that the Kennedy autopsy material will not be made
public. Also, I specifically said that George Stephanopoulos was
never a student of mine.) The text is attached.

2. Members of the ARRB will be examining security classified
records with a view to their declassification and public dis-
closure, in whole or in part, at some time in the future.

(a) Can you describe what prior experience you have had, if
any, with using or examining security classified records of the.
Federal Government?

During my army service in World War II as an enlisted man
and as an officer of the Army Security Agency at Arlington Hall
Station in Arlington, Virginia, I was engaged in cryptanalytic
and translation work on the most secret Japanese diplomatic codes
and ciphers. The resulting documents were classified TOP SECRET
ULTRA~- the highest classification of that day. I was also privy
to the MAGIC SUMMARY, which was issued daily to the White House

3

_ Di-17-93 11:83PM POO #27



13-00000

« 7

and to 10 Downing Street by Special Branch in the Pentagon, and
was also classified TOP SECRET ULTRA. :

(b) What do you think of our current security classification
system? For example, would you say it operates well, has va
integrity, and serves the public interest?

I am not faniliar with the intricacies of the classification
system at present. I have never requested documents under the
Freedom of Information Acts and have no personal experience on
which to base an answer to the sub-question.

As a diplomatic historian, I have been concerned that the -
long time-lag that now obtains in the publication of
Relations of the United States Series could be considerably
shortened without damage to the national interest. still, a -lack
of sufficient funds may be partly responsible for thie situation. :

3. One of the duties of the ARRB will be to determine what
constitutes an “assassination record". What criteria do you
think should be used to make this determination?

I believe that an "assassination record" would be any
document that directly or indirectly materially bears on the
assassination. The Board will have to create criteria for what
is meant by "materially". It is my further belief that in-
dividual documents and classes of documents will have to be
evaluated by the Board on a case-by-case basis.

IV. RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS

1. Do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable.
summons to appear and testify before any duly constituted commit-
tee of the Congress, if confirmed? :

Yes.
2. Do you agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable
request for information from any duly constituted committee of
the Congress, or its duly authorized agent, if conformed?

Yes.

PRE-HEARING ANSWERS FROM
KERMIT L. HALL

TO BE A MEMBER OF THE :
ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD a

1,__NOMINATION PROCESS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

Were any conditions, expressed or implied, attached to your
nomination to be a member of the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB)?

No.

Have you made any commitments with respect to policies or
programs affected by your role as a member of the ?, If
so, what are they? » 4

No.

Are there any issues involving the ARRB from which you may
have to disqualify yourself? If so, please explain.

No.

Have you been a party to any legal actions or administrative
proceedings pertaining to access to, or disclosure of, federal
records on the subject of the assassination of President
Kennedy?

No.

II. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

What particular qualifications and experiences do you bring to
the role of being a member of the ARRB?

I am a practicing historian of 21 years experience with a
thorough knowledge of American history and of archival and
recording management techniques. I have previously served on
committees and task forces charged with improving the
retention of both electronic and paper records. My service as
a scholar demonstrates, I believe, an even-handed approach to
major issues, a willingness to weight evidence impartially and
fairly, and to pursue truth with fidelity to the evidence.
Moreover, I have successfully brought to press books and
articles that have withstood the scrutiny of my peers..I have
worked extensively in archival, manuscript, and other
governmental materials, both of the nineteenth and the
twentieth centuries. These qualities of professionalism,
character, energy, and experience are essential to the

1



13-00000

© a

effective fulfillment of the duties of a member of the ARRB as
required under the statute.

What do you consider to be your primary responsibilities and
priorities as an ARRB member?

As a member of the Board, I will be asked to consider whether
a record constitutes an assassination record and whether an
assassination record or particular information in a record
qualifies for postponement or disclosure under the statute. In
fulfilling these responsibilities I will be required to adhere
faithfully to the letter and spirit of the enabling
legislation, which carries a presumption of the immediate
disclosure of all records relating to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. My responsibility is to serve the
public .interest in meeting this presumption with the
understanding that some materials may pose important fssues of
national security, identify a living person who provided
confidential information and would pose a risk of harm to that
person, invade privacy to a degree that outweighs the public
interest, and/or compromise a security or protective procedure
currently employed. In these cases a decision to postpone the
release of a document may be warranted. The burden in these
instances is clearly on the agency or other entity holding the
record to demonstrate that the presumption of release should
be set aside.. In every instance the question must be answered
whether the release of a document would be so harmful as to
outweigh the public interest in releasing it under the terms
of the statute.

How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities --
as an ARRB member ~~ to (a) the President, (b) the Congress,
and (c) other executive branch agencies?

As a member of the ARRB, I recognize that my official conduct
falls under the oversight of the Committee on Governmental
Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee
on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. Board members have a
duty to cooperate with the exercise of such oversight
jurisdiction. At the same time, the ARRB has authority to
direct Government offices to provide documents and related
finding aids for assassination records and, if necessary, to
investigate the facts surrounding additional information,
records, or testimony from individuals which may reasonably be
required for me to perform my duties under the statute. The
statute creating the ARRB provides that after it has made a
finding with regard to documents obtained or developed solely
within the executive branch, the President has the sole and
nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or
postponement of such record or information under, the
appropriate provisions of the statute. Throughout, the statue
clearly provides that the ARRB engaged in a mutually

2



13-00000

© &

constructive dialogue with the executive branch and the
Congress about the character and disclosure of documents.

How do you view the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role
do you anticipate playing in the selection of ARRB Executive
Director and staff?

Members of the ARRB are charged with appointing an Executive
Director, whose. responsibilities include serving as a
principal liaison to Government offices; administering and
coordinating the Board’s review of records; and administering
the official activities of the Board. The Executive Director
will have no authority to decide or determine whether any
record should be disclosed to the public or postponed “for
disclosure. That duty resides with the Board alone. The
selection of staff members will be done in keeping with the
statutory requirements. Staff members will have no atthority
to determine whether a record should be disclosed’ or
postponed.

IIL. POLICY ISSUES

Have you made any public statements -- oral or written --
regarding the assassination of President Kennedy or the public
availability of government records. regarding this
assassination? Please explain, and provide copies of any
relevant material.

I have made no public statements.

a) Can you describe what prior experience you have had, if
any, with using or examining security classified records
of the Federal Government?

From 1968 to 1969 I served as an officer in the United
States Army, a position that required me to handled many
classified documents and other materials. These documents
ranged from war plans, to encrypted messages, to
memoranda and working papers on various intelligence
matters.

b) What do you think of our current security classification
system? For example, would you say it operates well, has
integrity, and serves the public interest?

Although I have not worked with classified documents for
some time, my general sense is that the present system
probably- leans too heavily toward classification and
over-classification of materials that really do not
deserve protection. My own experience in years past
suggests a tendency to make secret that which is-
confidential and confidential that which is really not

3

{ALAS

« a

sensitive. Such a practice is perhaps understandable, -
given the vicissitudes of national security, but openness
and the general availability of information about the
conduct of government is to be cherished in a democracy.

One of the duties of the ARRB will be to determine what
constitutes an “assassination record". What criteria do you
think should be used to make this decision?

The statute creating the ARRB defines an assassination record
as a record that is related to the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, that was created or made available for use
by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of the
Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission, the Church
Commission, the Pike Commission, the House Assassination
Committee, the Library of Congress, the National Archives,
Presidential libraries, any Executive agency, any independent
agency, any other office of the Federal Government, and “any
State or local law enforcement office that provided support or
assistance or performed work in connection with a Federal
inquiry into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
I understand ‘that autopsy records donated by the Kennedy
family to the National Archives pursuant to a deed of gift
regulating access to those records,. or copies and
reproductions made from such records, are not included.

IV._RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS
Do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable
summons to appear and testify before any duly constituted
committee of the Congress, if confirmed?
Yes.
Do you agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable
request for, information from any duly constituted committee of
the Congress, or its duly. authorized agent, if confirmed?

Yes.

NOMINATED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE
ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

L__NOMINATION PROCESS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS a i

1. There have been no conditions, expressed or implied, attached to my
nomination to be a member of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).

2. | have made no commitments with respect to policies or programs
affected by my role as a member of the ARRB.

have to disqualify myself.

4. I have not been a party to any legal actions or administrative proceedings
pertaining to access to, or disclosure of, federal records on the subject of the
assassination of President Kennedy.

IL_ ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1. The particular qualifications and experience that | bring to the role of
being a member of the ARRB are the training and experience | have acquired as
a@ historian, in addition to my work-related experience as an archivist and
research library administrator.

2. My primary responsibilities and priorities as an ARRB member are to
establish, in concert with other. Board members, clear policies and sound
procedures that can guide the work of the staff that the Board is to hire. Once
policies and procedures are set and staff is in place, itis the Board's clear
tesponsibility to oversee the training of staff in effective procedures for reviewing
classified records, to advise staff in problem areas, and to oversee their work
generally.

As an ARRB member, | envision my relationship and responsbilities to:

a) the President to be one of faithfully executing to the best of my
ability the provisions contained in the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 ;

b) the Congress to be one of fulfilling the purposes of the same
legislation to the best of my ability, and to responding fully to
requests for information from appropriate oversight groups
conceming our progress;

c) other executive branch agencies to be one of cooperating to the
utmost of my ability to facilitate the review of any of their

assassination records and to provide them with full Information ae
conceming our activities.

4. | view the job of ARRB Executive Director to be one of organizing staff
for the most efficient and effective implementation of the policies and procedures
adopted by the Board. Apart from setting policies and procedures, there is no
more important task for the. Board than hiring the best-qualified Executive
Director and overseeing the Executive Director's hiring of staff.

Il, POLICY ISSUES

1. { have not made any public statements-- oral or written-- regarding the

assassination of President Kennedy or the public availability of govemment
tecords regarding this assassination.

2. As an ARRB member, | will be examining security classified records with
a view to at least partial public disclosure:

a) | have had prior experience with security classified records first in
working with the Papers of Senator Arthur Vandenberg at the William L.
Clements Library at The University of Michigan, where we had to initiate a
declassification review of parts of those papers, and, second, in my current duties
at Princeton University where we have had to initiate contact with the State
Department conceming the declassification review of hundreds of reels of
microfilm of the most important state documents as selected by John Foster
Dulles himself.

b) The current security classification system certainly has integrity. |
would hope that, in the interest of a fully informed citizenry and accountable
public officials, that somewhat more emphasis might be given to disclosure of
records after the passage of a specified period of time, allowing for agency

initiative to classify records beyond that time when they fall into specific
= categories that, in order to protect the national interest or privacy interests, must
continue to be restricted.

3. The cttiteria to be used to determine what constitutes an assassination
record will likely consist of several elements: the proximity of the record either to
the time of the assassination or to the related activity of an assassination
~ principal, and/or the content of the record manifestty relating it to the .
assassination, or an association of the record to the related activity of someone
known to have been involved in events plausibly connected to the assassination. .__

IV. TIONS WI S:
1. If confirmed, | agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable
summons to appear and testify before any duly constituted committee of the

Congress. |

First, since 1976, when I became a staff member of the
Public Documents Commission, I have been engaged in studies,:of
public records’ and’ have become knowledgeable about government -
recordkeeping and archival practices. I also have been a consistent
supporter of the preservation of records and timely access for
historical research. Between 1980 and 1988, I participated as a
Speaker on 15-16 programs having to do ‘with public records,.
archives or government information policy.

Second, as an active researcher in foreign policy records
as well as congressional records during the initial stages of the
Cold War era, I also have an understanding of the nature of
research and the kind of documentation required for such ‘research.

Third, as a member of an advisory committge: on
documentation in the State Department (which required a security
clearance), I have an appreciation of the kinds of ‘documents tha’
government agencies find too sensitive to release.

. Finally, I believe that in my work on preservation and
access I have illustrated a personal integrity that has allowed me
to gain the trust of my professional colleagues.

PRE-HEARING QUESTIONS
ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

NN

I. Nomination Process and Potential Conflicts

1. Were any conditions, expressed or implied, attached to your:
nomination to be a member of the Assassination Records Review Board
(ARRB) ?

No a

2. Have you made any commitments with respect to policies or
programs affected by your role as a member of the _ARRB? we ;
No 2 4

3. Are there any issues involving the ARRB Pall which you may
have to disqualify yourself?
No

4. Have you been a party to any legal actions or
administrative proceedings pertaining to access. to, or disclosure
of, federal records on the subject of the assassination of
President Kennedy?

No

II. Role and Responsibilities

1. What particular qualifications and experience do you bring
to the role of being a member of the ARRB?

a. Staff member. of the Public Documents Commission,
created by Congress after the Nixon tape controversy. This
Commission held hearings, sponsored studies on public records and
wrote a final report. As a staff member, I was introduced to the
promises and problems of preserving federal records and providing
access to them.

b. Project Director, Committee on Records of Government.
This foundation funded project was designed to study. the
relationship between information management and records management,
particularly as it applies to computer generated records. As
project director I worked closely with the Chairman of the
Committee and its members. I organized hearings, wrote summaries of
the hearings to be circulated to the Committee and was responsible
for preparation of the final report.

c. As an historian of American Foreign Relations, I have
researched documents ‘in the National Archives (including four
Presidential Libraries) from the era of the Cold War. I am very
familiar with "withdrawal" notices of classified material as well
as the kind of material that has been released.

d. I have been elected and/or appointed to several
comittees sponsored by various historical organizations that have


13-00000

page 2

been concerned with the declassification of historically valuable
documents. As a result, I am very familiar with FOIA and the
Executive Orders that control declassification.

2. What do you consider to be your primary responsibilities and
priorities as an ARRB member?

The primary responsibility of the ARRB is to ensure the review.
and facilitate the public disclosure of records relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy. It is important to note that it
is not the responsibility of the Board or its members to reach any
conclusions about the participants or events of the assassination.
Instead, the Board must ensure that the agencies comply with the
law. and either open or present to the Board ALL Gggunents
pertaining to the assassination. The obligation of. each méembe
to carefully study the documents that have not yet“been disclose
to weigh the need for public disclosure against the protection of
national security. A major priority of the Board should be the
preservation of its own integrity in order to ensure the
restoration of government credibility regarding the assassination.

3. How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities--as
an ARRB member --. to (a) the President, (b) the Congress, and (c)
other executive branch agencies?

a and b. My responsibility to the President and Congress is to
fulfill the trust and perform the tasks mandated by the legislation
to the best of my ability. I would be willing to confer with
members of the White House staff and the Congress on the progress
of the Board if it is necessary to do so to preserve the integrity
of the process.

c. The relationship with other executive branch agencies may
prove more problematical. To restore public confidence, the Board
must be’ guaranteed complete compliance with. the law by- all the
agencies with assassination related records. I would try to ensure
that agencies have.indeed searched for all relevant records, and
have either provided: public: access to them or prepared them for
action by the Board.

4. How do you view the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role do
you anticipate playing in the selection of ARRB Executive Director
and staff?

As described in.the statute, the Executive Director should be
responsibile for all administrative duties. These will involve
serving as a liaison to the agencies, describing the universe of
records, organizing hearings (if necessary), etc. The Executive
Director will not be responsible for policy and should not be
responsible for determining which documents can be opened to the
public.

I would anticipate that every Board member would actively seek ~

candidates for the position of Executive Director. However, since
five individuals cannot effectively run a Board, the elected Chair


13-00000

page 3

of the Board will be the person who will be closely working with
the Executive Director. Thus, the Chair should be particularly
involved in the selection process.

III. Policy Issues

1. Have you made any public statements -- oral or written --

regarding the: assassination of President Kennedy or the public

availability of government records regarding this assassinatioh?
No

2. Members of the ARRB will be examining security. classified
records with a view to their declassification and public
disclosure, in whole or in part, at some time in the future.

a) Can you describe what prior experience you have had, if
any, with using or examining security classified records of the
Federal Government?

As a member of the State Department Advisory Committee on
Historical Documentation I have examined documents that have been
deemed security classified (including intelligence documents) and
have participated in discussions of disclosure of documents in the
Foreign Relations of the United States series with desk officers of
State who did not wish to see these documents published. I have
also participated in meetings with agency personnel whose
responsibility included preserving national security related
documents.

b) What do you think of our current security classification
system? For example, would you say it operates well, has integrity,
and serves the public interests? 4

The current system is extremely expensive, labor
intensive and subjective in its implementation. It has resulted in
an enormous backlog of documents over 30 years old and has further
eroded public trust and government credibility. The current attempt
to rewrite the Executive Order governing the security
classification system reflects the awareness of the White House and
executive agencies that the current system is no longer viable; it
does not operate efficiently, sacrifices the integrity of the
record and does not, therefore, serve the public interest.

3. One of the duties of the ARRB will be to determine what
constitutes. an "assassination record". What criteria do you think
should be used to make this determination?

This will be one of the most difficult problems facing the
Board. First, I think I would seek information from the agencies on
what they regarded.as an assassination record. Second, since this
goes to the heart of public confidence, I think this is a question
that probably should be the subject of an open hearing. Currently
my sense is that the Board will have to determine parameters for

the kinds of records sought, but that these should be as broad.as
possible.

two. I have served throughout as the chief legal counsel to the Governor of Minnesota. I
have considerable experience dealing with Minnesota's open records law and have a
reputation of approaching issues in a fair, thoughtful and impartial manner. Ihave not
been involved in any dispute over the assassination records and believe that, although I am
a strong believer in openness in government, I will approach the task in a fair manner.. I

the Panel will conduct its work. I have played a leadership role within the National —

From my experience as Minnesota Chief Deputy Attommey General, I have
considerable experience dealing with the kind of processes envisioned by the Act,

working with a wide range of governmental agencies, resolving tough legal issues
raised by new laws, applying confidentiality rules, administering open records laws,
issuing subpoenas, conducting government public hearings, and making difficult
public decisions that significantly impact citizens. I understand the separation of
powers issues that could be raised in the context of this Act. Furthermore, I have
had no prior involvenicnt in,any aspect of the Kennedy assassination or the
assassination records. 1 would bring independent, objective judgment to the

position.

Talso have a strong interest in historical preservation. My primary undergraduate
major was History, an arca in which I graduated summa cum laude with honors. I

revicwing records at the National Archives. I have also provided legal
representation to the Minnesota Historical Society and State Archivist for eight

2. What do fou donsider to be your primary responsibilities and priorities as an ARRB

1 see our primary responsibilities as:

(1) Crenncclng ext Grooiing to offices of all’
foscenengeeey records that cae pelcon yet transmitted to the
and directing a prompt public disclosure of all appropriate

@ cng ore and information from the public to ensure that concerns are
and that all appropriate records are requested and received.

(3) Applying in a fair manner the standards set forth in the Act regarding
postponement of the release of records, keeping in mind the strong
Congressional intent expressed in the Act favoring public disclosure. ms

(4) Assuring the Congress and the American public that inforiiation about the:
Kennedy assassination is not being hidden by any branch or agency of the
federal government.

(5), As the lawyer on the panel, I believe that I have additional responsibilities to
help ensure that appropriate and fair processes are established to guide the
collection and release of records, that legal questions are addressed promptly
and thoroughly, and that any necessary investigations are handled properly.

How do you envision your relationship and responsibilities - as an ARRB member --
to (a) the President, (2) the Congress, nad (¢) other executive branch agencies?

(a) My responsibilities to the President are to provide a regular and detailed
accounting of the work of the ARRB, and to provide concise and thorough
postponement and release decisions in order to expedite the President's review

of ARRB decisions affecting executive branch agencies.

Although ARRB is an independent agency, it is important to have a smooth
working relationship with the President in order to ensure that the process
established by Congress works well.

&) My sespoisiblties tothe Congress are to fniplement the law prompy
the manner intended by Congress, to provide on a asis 2 ac
accounting of the work of the ARRB, and to respon a opaaely two oa

Congressional inquiries and requests.

(©) My responsibilities toward and relationship with other executive branch
agencies are to work cooperatively but firmly in ensuring carly transmittal of
documents to the National Archives. My responsibility includes working with
the agencies to ensure a complete understanding of agencies’ responsibilities
under the law and fairly and independently reviewing agencies’ requests to
postpone disclosure of any records.

How dowouview the job of ARRB Executive Director? What role do you anticipate
playing in the selection of ARRB Executive Director and staff?

I consider the Bxecutive Director to be the ARRB’s chief administrator and ~
coordinator of all functions of the panel. The Executive Director should be the day-
to-day administrator of the staff and the administrator of all activities of the ARRB.

J envision the Executive Director playing an important coordination role with of other
federal agencies.

J anticipate playing a role. in the selection of the Executive Director. The position is:
critical to the effectiveness of the ARRB and I would like to vse my considerable
rr wae L

WL POLICY ISSUES a a '
Have you made any public statements ~ oral or written — regarding the assassination
of President Kennedy or the public availability of government records regarding this
assassination? Please explain, and provide copies of any relevant material,

I have made no written or oral public statements regarding the Kennedy
assassination or the assassination xecords.

Members of the ARRB will be examining security classified records with a view to
their declassification and public disclosure, in whole or in part, at some time in the
future. :

a) Can you describe what prior experience yon have had, if any, with using or
examining security classified records of the Federal Government?

Ihave no prior experience with using or examining security classified records
of the federal government. I have, however, considerable experience handling
documents protected by state confidentiality laws.

b) What do you think of our current security classification system? For example,
‘would you say it operates well, has integrity, and serves the public interest?

The security classification system has generally well served the public interest
throughout the period in which the Cold War placed significant constraints on
sharing information. We have entered a new era and my understanding is that
a comprehensive review is now underway that will likely result in significant
revisions and the development of a less restrictive system of security
classification. Such a comprehensive review is a positive development.

3. One of the duties of the ARRB will be to determine what constitutes an “assassination -
record." What criteria do you think should be used to make this determination?

The definition of “assassination records" will be one of the most important and
significant decisions of the ARRB. Itis important to understand better the universe
of potential records before the difficult decision on how to define * ‘assassination
records." Preliminarily, and without such an understanding yet, I would favora
broad definition because (1) a broad definition will help assure the American public
that all relevant records are being reviewed and disclosed, and (2) I believe that is
the intent of Congress as expressed in the Act.

It may well be difficult to define "assassination records” in 2 manner which will

cover all relevant documents, and if so, it may. be necessary to establish a

mechanism by which a case-by-case determination can be made regirding the

linkage between the assassination and a particular document. . 7
Iv. RELATIONS WITH CONGRESS

L._-‘Do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable summons to appear
and testify before any duly constituted committee of the Congress, if confirmed?

Yes.

2. Do you agree without reservation to reply to any reasonable request for information
from any duly constituted committee of the Congress, or its duly authorized agent, if
confirmed?

” Yes.

Tntroduction

The specter of conspixacy has haunted Americans throughout the second half of
the twentieth century. nl In the 1950s, Senater Joseph {*2) McCarthy's
Communist conspiracy theory - the "second Red Scare" - traumatized the nation
and destroyed lives. n2 More recently, David Irving's explanation of the
Holocaust as an enormous historical fabrication n3 has defied logic and
distorted reality. n¢ Even Abraham Lincoln rests uneasily in his grave, as
theorists of his murder advance plots so tangled that only the exhumation of
John Wilkes Booth's bones can unravel them. n5

ml. This phenomenon is not unique to the modern era. There are many
comprehensive historical accounts of the specter of conspiracy in America. See,
e.g., Virginia Carmichael, Framing History: The Rosenberg Story and the Cold War
(1993) (analyzing and tracing the "politically motivated production of the
official Rosenberg story and the historical and cultural critiques performed by
its re-presentation in literature, drama and the visual arts"); David Brion
Pavis, The Slave Power Conspiracy and the Paranoid Style (1969) (discussing the
theory that slaveowners conspired against the rest of the country); The Fear of

These are compelling examples of the American appetite for intrigue, but no
ether event in twentieth-century American history has generated such persistent
notions of conspiracy as the assassination of President John fF. Kennedy. More
than four hundred books have been published on the subject;. né a major
newsletter provides. a continu- (#3) ing flow of new theories about the
assassination; n7 and a national organization, the Coalition on Political
Assassinations, meets annually to debate the murder. né Oliver Stone elevated
the idea of conspiracy to epic proportions in the film JFK. n9 That movie
claims, among other things, that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone; rather, he
was part of a plot hatched by the Central Intelligence Agency (CTA) in
collaboration with organized crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),
and other elements of the American government. n10 Stone's follow-up to JFK,
Nixon, nil echoes this theme, intimating a connection between the Cuban burglars
of the Watergate complex and the assassination of President Kennedy. ni2

. This Article addresses the Kennedy murder, generally; the work of the
Assassination Records Review Board, primarily; n13 and issues of secrecy and
openness in government, specifically. In short, the Article considers the
competing values of openness and secrecy in government. nlé4 Gaining accese to
secret documents is vital, but one must considex the cost of broken. confidences
to our security. A sense of conflict between these views inspired thie ArticYé.

nl3. The author sits as a member of the Assassination Records Review Board.
The views expressed herein are solely those of the author. They do not represent
the views of the other members of the Board.

The other members of the Board are the Honorable John R. Tunheim, United
States District Judge, District of Minnesota; Henry Graff, Professor Emeritus,
Columbia University; William Joyce, Rare Books Librarian, Firestone Library,
Princeton University; and Anna K. Nelson, Adjunct Professor of History, American
University. :

The Assassination Records Review Board will hereinafter be referred to as the
"JFK Board” or the "Board." eee
Throughout this Article, references are made to the views of the various
intelligence agencies. These references are based upon the author's knowledge of
these representations made to the Assassination Records Review Board, the
context of which remains classified.

nl4. See generally Benjamin S. DuVal, Jr., The Occasions of Secrecy, 47 U.
Pitt. L. Rev. 579, $83 (1966) (arguing that secrecy issues "present a
fundamentally different problem in terms of first amendment theory than those
that have been central to the development of first amendment jurisprudence" and
that "society is bende! ambivalent about the benefits of increased
knowledge") .

I.. The Warren Commission

The Warren Commission and its report stand at the center of almost 411 Kennedy
conspiracy theories. niS A year after the assassination, the Report was issued
by seven sober-minded Americans, headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren. nlé
Initially, the Report, which concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin, nl7
received strong support. Polling data indicates that prior to the Report's

release, only twenty-nine percent of the public believed that Oswald was solely
responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy; following its release a
year later, in 1964, that number increased to eighty-seven percent. However, two
years later, in 1966, only thirty-six-percent of Americans indicated they

{*5] believed the Report. nls By the time JFK opened in the movie houses of

America, nl9 public confidence in the Commission's Report had. sunk even further,

with about seventy percent of Americans concluding that Oswald did not act
alone. n20 The movie, therefore, tapped a deep wellspring of distrust of the
Report rather than, as is sometimes implied, n21 fostered it.

available in LEXIS, News Library, Wires File; see also Max Holland, The Key to
the Warren Report, Am. Heritage, Nov. 1995, at 50, 52 ("Prior to [the Report's]

had acted alone, afterward 87 percent believed so.").

young on November 22, 1963, are especially likely to be among the 62 percent who
believe the truth has not been told. In keeping with many recent polls that show
Americans are distrustful toward government, 78 percent think there was an.
official coverup."). Indeed, there is now a much more conspiracy-minded attitude
toward the assassination than there was even 15 years ago. See id.

n21. See, e.g., Brustein, supra note 10 ("Viewers of JFK ... might find
themselves shaken in their views of government, society, the media.").

Events between 1964 and 1992 did much to undermine trust in the Warren
Commission Report. An assassination research community quickly appeared, raising
troubling questions about the Report and propagating theories of conspiracy. n22
Books entitled Whitewash, n23 Contract on America, n24 Conepiracy, n25 and Rush
to Judgment n26 eroded the credibility of the Commission's findings. n27
President Kennedy's murder, moreover, was only one of several prominent
political killings. Aseaseins also gunned down Robert F. Kennedy, Martin

The government's penchant for secrecy fueled the public's corrosively
cynical view of politics and politicians. During the Watergate investigation,
President Nixon proclaimed to the nation that he was "not a crook," n35 but he
soon abandoned the Oval Office and joined his disgraced vice president n36 in
private life. n37 In one of the great ironies of modern American politics, the
instrument of Nixon's downfall was a secret recording syatem installed in the
White House. 03@ What was supposed to be a tool to record reliably the
President's triumphs became the chief means of exposing the Watergate cover-up.

Under such circumstances, the Warren Commission's Report would have been-.
subjected to reevaluation even if it had been compiled perfectly. Furthermord,
because the Warren. Commission labored at the height of the Cold War; n40 the
Commissioners adopted a strategy that depended on implicit public trust. The
Cold War environment combined with other circumstances to handicap the Warren
Commission and eventually to erode that public trust in five significant ways.

First, the Commission had access to an enormous amount of information. not
otherwise accessible to the American press and public. n41 This information was
secret, top secret, and beyond, much of it compartmentalized cryptologic and
signal intelligence material dealing with the Soviet Union, Cuba, and other
foreign governments, such as Communist China. né2 Because of the enormous Cold
War paranoia, as well as the requirement to maintain tight secrecy around the
sources and methods used to collect this information, the Commission could not
argue ite case fully to the American people. When the research community
asserted that the government itself had been im- [+e] plicated in the
assassination, n43 the evidence that the Commission had used to discount such a
possibility was available only to the government charged with having abetted the
crime. The cost of secrecy was uncertainty, an uncertainty that turned to
cynicism, much of it based on theories about the assassination that gained
legitimacy simply because they could not be tested against the appropriate
evidence.

Second, although the Commission had access to some high-quality intelligence
information, it did not receive everything. The CIA, FBI, and Attorney General
Robert F. Kennedy failed to reveal information that would have helped identify a
motive for a conspiracy. n44 The failure to disclose all information to the
Commission was particularly damaging because of the distinguished character of
its seven members. n45 Its chairman was Chief Justice Earl Warren, a person
noted for probity and fairness. n46 The Commission was really divided into two
subgroups. Four of the members - Warren, Hale Boggs, Gerald Ford, and John
Sherman Cooper - had relatively little experience with intelligence matters;
however, the other three - Richard Russell, Allen Dulles, and John J. McCloy -
were fully conversant with national security issues and the sources and methods
used by the intelligence services. n47 zi

The Commission's success depended, in part, on the ability of the three
intelligence-savvy members to raise the right questions. They seem not to have
done. so. For example, the Commission never discovered the existence of Operation
MONGOOSE, n48 a covert scheme concocted by President Kennedy and his brother,
Attorney General {r9] Robert F. Kennedy, to assassinate Fidel Castro with
the help of organized crime. n4a9 When these plans reached the public several
years later, critics of the Warren Commission had a field day. n50 The
Commission's conclusion that a foreign government lacked a sufficient motive to
murder the President now crumbled. n51 Indeed, the Commission looked silly and,
even worse, to be a part of the plot because its. critics could plausibly assert
that its distinguished members should have guessed at such a possibility.

Oswald's time in the Soviet Union and his trip to visit the Soviet Embassy.in
Mexico City just weeks before the murder pointed to Communist intrigue. n54
concerns were amplified because Oswald had identified himself with-the Fair

critical of Kennedy's Cuba policy. n55 Thus, the Commission was under enormous
pressure to produce an answer that discounted foreign influence. n56

Fourth, as the science of forensic analysis has progressed over the past
three decades, questions have inevitably arisen about the Warren Commission's
conclusions involving the President's body, n57 the alleged murder weapon, n5é
the number and sequencing of the shots [*10] fired at the President, n59 and
the condition of the so-called "magic bullet," which passed through the
President and Governor John. Connally with a minimum amount of damage. n60 We now
know that the autopsy performed on the President was problematic, both in
technique and organization. n6é1 Yet, the Commission relied on it. On. other
matters, new forms of analysis have been generally supportive of the
Commission's findings; although it now appears that the sequencing of the shots
fired in Dealey Plaza was somewhat different from that described by the
Commission. né2 Ironically, even when the latest techniques cor- {*11]
roborate the Commission's findings, the result has not been greater confidence
in those findings, but rather, a belief that the Commission got it wrong instead
of almost getting it right. né3

Committee on Assassinations, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1828 pt. 2 (1979). The House
Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that the acoustical evidence
established that a fourth shot was fired, and, therefore, there was a “high
probability" that two gunmen fired at President Kennedy. Id. at 65-79. The
Committee relied on analyses of a dictabelt recording of the Dallas police
channels. See id. at 66-67. Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. performed the first
analysis and concluded - based on impulse patterns detected from the recording
and an acoustical reconstruction of the assassination - that there was a 50%
chance of a fourth shot from the Grassy Knoll. See id. at 66-72. Mark Weiss and
Ernest Aschkenasy performed a follow-up analysis for the Committee and concluded
that there was a. 95% chance there was a shot fired from the Grassy Knoll. See.

Fifth, the Warren Commission Report ~ all 888 pages of it - was the work of
lawyers, who not only dominated the Commission, but also its staff, the true
authors of the Report. né4 The final document. reads like a legal brief
supporting the argument that Oswald committed the crime. The Report ought to
have been a dispassionate analysis of all of the implications surrounding the
murder, some of which the Commission itself had no knowledge. n6S Instead, the
Report was a mound of facts that obscured the issue of Oswald's motivation and
portrayed him as a sullen, dysfunctional, and troubled loner. néé By

n66. For example, the Report made the following findings with regard to
Oswald's character:

Many factors were undoubtedly involved in Oswald's motivation for the
assassination, and the Commission does not believe that it can ascribe to him

any one motive or group of motives. It is apparent, however, that Oswald was-,
moved by an overriding hostility te his environment. He does not appear to hdve  _
been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people. He was
perpetually discontented with the world around him.

II. Other Investigations of the Assassination

Between 1964 and 1979, the American intelligence services were subjected to
unparalleled scrutiny, much of it fueled by the CIA's and FBI's ties to the
Watergate debacle and by revelations of domestic political surveillance by both
agencies and the military intelligence services. n72 There were three other

federal investigations that, in dealing with these issues, also addressed the
Kennedy assassination: in the mid-1970s, the Rockefeller Commission, n73 the i
Pike Committee, n74 and [*13] the Church Committee n75 probed matters that
touched on matters relating to the assassination and provided, moet

spectacularly, information about Operation MONGOOSE. n76 Operation MONGOOSE az
involved CIA plans to destabilize the Cuban government, murder Castro and other a
leaders of hostile foreign nations, and relied on organized crime to assist with > {

n76. According to Loch K. Johnson; a series of articles by New York Times
reporter Seymour Hersh in December 1974 prompted the creation of all three
committees. See Johnson, supra note 29, at 3-4, 207-08. Hersh revealed, among
other abuses, that the CIA had compiled files on over 10,000 U.S. citizens as
part of Operation CHAOS. See id. at 3.

To investigate Hersh's claims, President Gerald R. Ford created the
Rockefeller Commission, named after its chairman, Nelson Rockefeller. See
Rockefeller Commission, supra note 73, at ix; see also Exec. Order No. 11,828, 3
C.F.R. 933-34 (1975). The Senate created’a special committee chaired by Frank
Church. See Church Committee, supra note 48, at 1-3 (stating the Church
Committee's mandate and scope of investigation). Otis Pike, the chairman of the
House's standing committee on intelligence, investigated for the House. See
supra note 74. The Rockefeller Commission was to decide if the CIA had

violated 50 U.S.C. 403 (the statute creating the CIA), to determine whether
there were adequate safeguards to prevent activities that violated the statute,
and to make xecommendations to the President and the director of the CIA. See
id. at x. The Commission was to issue its final report within three months and
to terminate one month after presenting its report. See Exec. Order No. 11,828,
3.C.P.R. 933-34. The Commission found, inter alia, that (1) the CIA's

surveillance of mail between the United States and the Soviet Union was illegals ©

(2) the declared mission of Operation CHAOS to determine foreign influence on
domestic dissidence was proper, but some activities exceeded the CIA's
authority; (3) the infiltration of dissident groups exceeded its authority. See
Rockefeller Commission, supra note 73, at 20-27.

to determine if there were any ""illegal, improper or unethical'" governmental
intelligence activities. Church Committee, supra note 48, at 1 (quoting S. Res.

of the Rockefeller Commission. See id. at 2. The Church Committee investigated
murder plots against Lumumba, Castro, Trujillo, Diem, and Schneider. See id. at

personnel plotted to kill Castro from 1960 to 1965." Id.

77. See supra note 48.

investigation revealed evidence that, from 1960 to 1965, the United States
government used underworld figures and anti-Castro Cubans in a plot to kill
Castro. See id. 7

The most powerful of the post-Warren Commission inquiries was that made by
the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), which in 1976 reopened the
investigation that had been seemingly closed a dozen years earlier. n79 The
Committee, chaired by Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio, explored several
controversial areas of John F. Kennedy's assassination, along with those of his
brother, Rob- [#14] ert, and Reverend King. n80 The HSCA suffered from its
own limitations, which are beyond the scope of this Article. n81 However, the
HSCA's conclusions, which now seem to be in question, held that the Committee
could not rule out a conspiracy to kill the President. n82 This finding directly
challenged the Warren Commission. n83 For example, the HSCA believed that
advanced acoustical techniques demonstrated that there had been more than one
shooter in Dealey Plaza, n84 That analysis was subsequently. repudiated, néS but
it was too late to counter the damage done to the Warren Commission's

exedibility. a

III. The Assassination Records Review Board

The findings of these investigations inspired Oliver Stone's 1991 movie. né7
Without endorsing the. movie's sengational conclusions, many members of Congress
decided that the government's refusal to release classified information about
the assassination promoted an unhealthy level of distrust of government. n8é As
a result, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection
Act of 1992 n89 (the JFK Act or Act), which mandated the creation of a
five-person Review Board. n90 The Act ordere all federal agencies to assess
whether they (*15] possess records relating to the assassination. n91 All
records that an agency deems as not suitable for immediate release are subject
to the Board's évaluation. n92 All records identified as relating to the
assassination must be opened by October 26, 2017, with the éxception of records
that the President certifies for continued postponement. n93

The Act defines several categoxies of information for which disclosure may
be postponed, including national security, intelligence gathering, personal ’
privacy, and presidential security. n94 However, because the Act de¢lares a
"presumption of immediate disclosure," the Board will not postpone the
disclosure of material unless it is persuaded that there is "clear and

be in favor of opening a document rather than postponing it. thus making
postponement the exception rather than the rule under the law. The Congress

Although the Board's mission is clear, in executing the law it continualay :
confronts the powerful tensions generated by the principled claims of openness 3

ground in public disclosure, confronts some profound choices. Those choices have
to be informed, moreover, by a shrewd assessment of the public's right to know,
the public's need to have secrets vital to its national security protected, and
the intelligence services' duty to safeguard those secrets and the sources and
methods that produce them. n100

The Board's most difficult choices involve the disposition of classified
intelligence documents. If a federal agency wants to open materials, it is not
the Board's duty to prevent it. Rather, the Board's most important task is to
decide what should not be opened immediately, in light of the Act's powerful
admonition that there be "clear and convincing evidence’ in favor of
postponement. n101 In simplest terms, the Board has to decide whether materials,
if opened, would reveal:

(A) an intelligence agent whose identicy currently requires protection;

(B) an intelligence source.or method which is currently utilized, or
reasonably expected to be utilized, by the United States Government: and which
has not been officially disclosed, the disclosure of which would interfere with
the conduct of intelligence activities; or

IV. Openness and Secrecy - OriginalIntentions

History offers uncertain guidance about how the Board should weigh these grounds
for postponement against the public's interest in knowing the facts about the
assassination. The Framers of the United States Constitution did harbor doubts
about government, doubts precipitated by their experience in the English Empire.
ni07 James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, among others, testified eloquently to
the proposition that public accountability was an appropriate measure of the
success of a republic. ni08 Still, the Framers were also sophisticated statesmen
who valued secrecy in fostering the public good. n109 For example, the
Philadelphia Convention of 1787 conducted its deliberationa in secret without
any complete xecord of its debates. nl10 The Constitution provides for the
maintenance of an executive journal for both Houses of Congress and permits
government to publish its accounts and revenues from "time to time," rather than
on demand. nili Even more fundamental was President George Washington's
assertion of a broad degree of presidential discretion in dealing with foreign
relations, war, and peace. n112 In certain circumstances, secrecy could be
justified to attain ends superior to a completely in- (*18) formed public.
Indeed, the Constitution's Preamble declares that insuring. "domestic
Tranquility" and providing for the “common defence" are objectives equal to
securing the "Blessings of Liberty." n113

On the question of original intention, the evidence is mixed. Secrets were
lat once bad and useful, openness was an object to be pursued, but not at all
costs. Since 1787, the government has become more rather than less accountable,
its secrets more rather than less readily accessible to its citizens. n114

V. Openness and Secrecy - FOIA

For more than 190 years, the American public did not have a legal right to gain
access to information about its government. nl15 All of that changed, however,
in 1966 when President Lyndon Johnson signed FOIA nllé and thereby altered the
historical relationship between the federal government and the public. n117 FOIA
(presumes that government information is public information and is implemented by
‘the judicially enforceable requirement that all federal agency records be made
available promptly upon request, subject only to nine exemptions, which are to
be narrowly construed. n118

nls. The issue of openness. in government has historically been framed in’
terme of the right of the government to keep secrets, rather than the right of
the public to have access to governmental records. See Seth F. Kreimer, Sunlight
Secrets and Scarlet Letters: The Tension Between Privacy and Disclosure in
Constitutional Law, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1991). The movement towards greater
openness in the post-World War II period has been part of a broader movement in
the twentieth century to hold government accountable for its actions. See id. As
a result, since the progressive era of the early twentieth century, we have seen
the institution of public records, open meetings, and "sunshine laws." See id.

nlié. 5 U.S.C. 552 (1994).

nll7. The Act has come under criticism from both advocates of openness and
proponents of secrecy. See, e.g., Carome & Susman, supra note 98, at 223
(eriticizing the Act because the cost of implementation outweighs the benefits
it is supposed to provide); Non-Denial: How Attitudes and Inertia Combine to
Subvert the Preedom of Information Act, Kiplinger Program Rep. 1-32 (Summer
1994) (discussing the success of FOIA’in providing Americans with a means of
acquiring information about their government).

niié. 5 U.S.C. 552.

Critics of FOIA seldom doubt its good intentions, but they do doubt its
effectiveness, complaining that the cost of implementing it (*19) far
outweighs its supposed benefits. nli9 The argument against FOIA was perhaps best
summed up by Justice Antonin Scalia, who described the statute as "the Taj Mahal
of the Doctrine of Unanticipated Consequences, the Sistine Chapel of
Cost-Benefit Analysis ignored.“ 120 Critics like Justice Scalia charge that
FOIA harms the government's and the public's legitimate need for secrecy. n121

VI. The Business of Secrecy

Today, keeping information secret has become a massive industry in Washington.

nl24 According to official estimates, the government took 6.3 million

Classification actions in 1994, creating an estimated 19 million pages of

information that only selected government officials can see. n12$ More than

32,000 government workers are employed full-time to determine what should be

secret, what level of secrecy the material should have, and whether the

@ocuments should be classified. n126 The. government holds hundreds of millions

of pages of secret documents; indeed, the precise number has gone beyond the + -
government's ability to count. n127 :

so. nl30 For more than fifty years, the Department followed a scheme of
classification that might best be called "classified at birth." nl31 Any
document generated was presumed secret until proved otherwise. n132 The
Department and its civilian contractors have literally lost track of what needs
to be kept quiet. n133 Even more fundamental, what is genuinely in need of Pa
protection - the design of weapons and such - is lost in-an ocean of documents
no longer worthy of classified status (if they ever were). nl34¢

VII. The Board and the Intelligence Services
The JFK Act is an attempt not only to deal with the issue of public araearert a
in government, n141 but also to forge a model of how we might keep: from sinking
in our own secrets. Yet, the intelligence community resists thé opeiing of 7
classified materials, even those that are now a third-of-a-century old. This
defiance is particularly ironic in the case of the Kenaedy assassination, in
that the intelligence agencies most troubled by the disclosures are the same
ones that most often figure in conspiracy theories. nl42 Disclosing materials
that the CIA and FBI want postponed might actually affirm that neither a foreign
nor domestic conspiracy existed and demonstrate the vital role they played in
sgupporting American interests in the Cold War.

Congress never contemplated total disclosure, otherwise it would not have
created the JFK Board. nl43 Disclosure is an important public interest, but so
too is protecting sensitive information. nl44 There are many occasions for
secrecy. For example, most deliberative bodies make a virtue of secrecy, because
it permits compromise by allowing individuals to make concessions without losing
face, nl45 The Supreme Court has observed: “Human experience teaches that those
who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a
concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the
decisionmaking process." nl46 The Court knows whereof it speaks, as its
decisionmaking process in conférence remains entirely confidential. 0147

certain secrets from disclosure. See 44 U.S.C, 2107(6) (1994) (identifying the
grounds on which the Review Board may postpone release of assassination
materials); Sanders & Zaid, supra note 62, at 419 (explaining the Board's
obligations when it decides to postpone release of a document).

nl44. See Duval, supra note 14, at 668-71 (identifying 10 justifications for _-
nondisclosure) .

nl45. See id. at 621-22 (observing that maintaining secrecy of advice,
recommendations, and opinions allows officials to “propose, comment, and
eriticize without concern that their comments may seem foolish or contrary to
popular sentiment" and to compromise “without logs of face").

nidé6. United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974) (footnote omitted). *

nl47. Secrecy in the High Court is a practice, a matter of the Court's.
culture and traditions, not of law. See Bob Woodward & Scott Armstrong, The >.
Brethren xi (1979) ("The Court has developed certain traditions and rules,
largely unwritten, that are designed to preserve the secrecy of its’
deliberations."). The Justice who tells what took place in conference is
indiscreet and is likely to forfeit the respect of other Justices, but he breaks
mo law and neither do his law clerks. See id. Indeed, one of the arguments
wxaised in the wake of opening the papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall was that
his written commentary. on his colleagues may have made it more difficult for
them to deal with one another now knowing that the public understood the reasons
that they held certain positions. See id. at xii (observing that, because
Justices are not elected but are appointed for life, they are not disposed to
allow their decisionmaking to become public). The matter is posed differently,
however, in Great Britain. The Official Secrets Acts make it unlawful for a
government employee to-make an unauthorized disclosure of official information
er for anyone who has received the information in violation of the Act to
communicate it to anyone else. Official Secrets Act, 1911, 1 & 2 Geo. S ch. 28,
2.

The virtues of openness in government, therefore, can be and often are
overstated, especially by a self-interested press and media. Openness does mean
that bad advice can be challenged, but the consequence may be that good
decisions are never reached. Open records and “sunshine laws" n146 may only
drive people to less easily documented forms of communication, such as the
telephone. n149 Although the costs and benefits of secrecy and openness in
government are not easily calculated, we do know that loose lips still sink
ships, even in our own thermonuclear. age.

In the case of the Kennedy assassination, how far are we willing to
countenance secrecy when a fully illuminated rendition of the events surrounding
tha President's murder could go a long way to restore trust in government? At ae
what point do the costs of concealing materiale become sufficiently high to our
government's credibility that they are no longer worth paying? At what point do
the costs of disclosure become so great that we compromise our future sécurity?

What duty does the government owe to persons who agree to serve as oa oe
informants? There axe many: reasons why persons serve as informants.’Money, <
revenge, and the sheer thrill explain some of this behavior. Yet, above all
else, informants expect that they will be clothed in confidentiality in return
for their information. An informant who is identified immediately loses value.
All informants in the service of the various domestic and international
intelligence operations are recruited with an understanding that they will be
gvanted confidentiality - that they will never be "given-up" in the lingo of the
intelligence community. n161 The very nature of what they are asked to do -
commit treason on their home government, report on the activities of groups like
the American Communist Party, or shed light on the activities of organized crime
and terrorist groups - exposes them to tremendous danger; if they are revealed,
they and their families may suffer serious personal injury, or even death.

The Kennedy assassination documents contain thousands.of names of informants
drawn from every walk of life. The FBI has taken the position that these names
must be protected indefinitely and that any disclosure will impair the Bureau's
ability to recruit new informants. Yet, all informants are not created equal.
Some have greater value than others, both for the story of the Kennedy
assassination and for providing information about organized crime and other
activities. Moreover, the issue is not simply one of the quality of the
information [*25] that is provided. As Exhibit One demonstrates, the vast
majority of documents involving informants has been opened in part; infrequently
only the names of the informants and other key identifying language has been vA
xedacted. nl62 These redactions breed a sense of expectation among researchere,
because in the climate of conspiracy that surrounds the Kennedy assassination,
any material that is covered up is presumed to be an important missing link in
the chain of explanation about the murder.

Exhibit One is perhaps representative of the issues raised about the Review
Board's disclosure of informants. The Exhibit contains a message sent by the iat
Special Agent in Charge (SAC) in Houston to the SAC in Dallas and to FBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover on November 26, 1963, four days after the murder of
President Kennedy. nl63 This document was originally reviewed by the FBI, and
designated for release under the terms of the JFK Act with certain materials
redacted. Those redactions appear in Exhibit One and indicate what material the

FBI wanted to keep from the public. n164 -

As Exhibit Two reveals, the Board decided that much of the redacted material
could be released, most notably the name of Mary Ann McCall, a hostess at a
Dallas night spot. ni6é5 By the time the informant had interviewed McCall, Jack
Ruby had already killed Oswald. The Board decided that the historical record was
well sexved by opening McCall's name, especially given her purported
relationship with the Dallas police and organized crime. The Board, however,
also accepted the FBI's argument that the name of the person who provided the ~~
information about McCall. should be protected. Consequently, a document that had
many redactions when it was sent from the FBI to the Board went into the public
record with only one name redacted. The Board wag satisfied that revealing the
informant's name would haxmthe informant, thug outweighing the value of
immediate disclosure. The Board used substitute language to make clear to
students of the assassination that the redacted portion was the name of a
"confidential informant" and ordered that the name be released in the year 2010.

Should it matter to the Board that many of these informants, when
interviewed after the assassination, did not provide positive information about
Oswald or Ruby? There are countless examples of (*26] individuals who, when
contacted by intelligence services, indicated that they knew nothing about the
assassination. The Board has taken the position that intelligence services must a
demonstrate that harm would come to the individual if her name were released.
Agencies must be able to identify the individual, indicate that she is still
alive, and establish that some harm will befall her. n16?7 The threshold issue,

therefore, is whether an agency that seeks to protect an individual, regardless
of the quality of the information provided, can substantiate the claim that harm
will come to that person as a result of revealing her name. When an agency has
failed to do so, the Board has released the name. ni68 The record of events
surrounding the assassination will never be complete until we know what blind
alleys are not worth pursuing. As any good investigator knows, eliminating blind,’ Wes
alleys is critical, because the elimination provides additional certainty abouc
who knew nothing, a fact that can be helpful in discerning who knew something.
In this context, knowing that an informant knew nothing, at least by her
statement, is valuable itself, given the complexity of the conspiracy theories
surrounding the assassination.

Spying is a feature of modern foreign affairs, and there can be no doubt u
that, as with informants, we owe some protection to those individuals employed
in the clandestine service of the CIA. n169 Understanding how our clandestine
services operate and what information they did or did not provide is critical to
the assassination story. For example, the CIA sought to protect a considerable-
amount of information involving the use of double agents to infiltrate the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. As Exhibit Three makes clear, the Agency
originally wanted to protect broad sections of a message sent on November 29,
1963, one week after the murder of the President. n170 The CIA believed that
releasing the information would compromise the (*27} double agents and
reveal the scope of the Agency's efforts against the former Soviet government.
Yet, in terms of the story of the assassination, knowing the quality of the
effort directed against the Soviets in Mexico City was considered crucial. As
Exhibit Four reveals, only weeks before Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for
Killing President Kennedy, Oswald had visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
seeking a visa that would allow him to return to the Soviet Union by way of
Cuba. nl171 The Board opened most of the information that the Agency previously
wanted to postpone, and where the Board determined that disclosure would be
harmful, it relied on substitute language, which is handwritten in Exhibit
Three. nl72

The CIA also worries about the status of its former employees and expects + ae
that these employees will not reveal the nature of their activities without

to answer questions? Does an agent in the clandestine service of tHe country
have a right to be free from the prying questions of researchers and reporters?
Does it make any difference, as in the case of informants, that an agent
provided only negative information? Should we worry about whether an agent is
alive or dead? or does it follow that significant harm might come to the agent's
family and friends through the revelation of her name? Are we willing, in the
interest of providing the fullest and richest historical record of the
assassination, to subject spouses, children, and parents to potential harassment
or worse?

Weighing the potential harm to such persons against the public's right to
know is challenging. We should recall that in 1975, Richard Welch, the CIA

returned to his home from a party at the ambassador's residence. ni74 Former CIA

The value of confidential FBI and CIA sources to the Warren Commission's
work is underscored by the documents released thus far by the Board. For
example, Exhibit Four is a letter dated June 17, 1964 from FBI Director J. Edgar”
Hoover to J. Lee Rankin, then General Counsel to the Warren Commission. n176 The |
letter details what the FBI knew about Fidel Castro's assessment of the
assassination..n177 Originally classified as "Top Secret," this document
indicates that the United States had a source sufficiently close to Castro to S
gauge the Cuban leader's evaluation of Oswald and the circumstances surrounding
his visit to the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. ni78 The FBI.wished to redact
much of this material. The FBI was concerned that Castro's tests were at -
variance with the FBI's test results. The Board decided that the information
contained in the letter was critical to the assassination story; nl79 therefore,
the entire document was made available to the American public, illuminating-4)
thinking of Castro and the credibility of the American intelligence community

In matters of informants and agents, the JFK statute directs the agencies to
provide the Board with "clear and convincing evidence" that disclosure will
result in harm, either to an individual or to current operations. n160 If the
FBI, for example, is unable to find a former informant, and thus does not know
whether she is alive or dead, what is the Board's duty? The Board faces the
dilemma of either erring on the side of protecting the individual's identity,
even though there is no evidence that the person is alive and living under a

_ Gurrent threat, or enriching the historical record by revealing the individual's
identity while running the risk of causing unnecessary harm.

There is also the related. question of how to treat the names of persons

when there is no proof, other than the informant's word, to support the
accusation. Is that individual owed a right (#29) to know that he or she was
so identified, or is it the Board's duty to redact the person's name? Would
disclosing false information be more damaging than retaining it in government

records where only government officials have access to such information?

These questions indicate the range of issues associated with deciding
whether to postpone releasing the names of informants and agents. Where does the
requirement for a full historical record of the Kennedy assassination yield to
the prudential uses of secrecy to preserve the nation's ability to gather a
intelligence?

IX. Sources and Methods a

The JFK Act requires the Board to balance the need to protect sources and u
methods of intelligence collection with the public need for disclosure of i
information relating to the assassination. n181 The inappropriate release of
documents, either in part or in full, dealing with our intelligence agencies'
sources and methods could afford hostile nations, organized crime, terrorists; .-
and drug dealers an understanding of our intelligence capabilities, If another “3.
nation ox a térrorist group knows how we are able to. exercise surveillance over ~
them, they are likely to adopt appropriate countermeasures. They also might seek
to provide selectively misleading information, knowing that we are listening and
how we are listening. Many of the documents already available in the JFK
Collection at the National Archives indicate that the United States bugged,
tapped, photographed, and otherwise conducted surveillance of persons and

places. The question arises whether we should also reveal the precise kind of
equipment that was used, how it was employed, and against whom it was targeted.
Knowledge about equipment and technique would be important in evaluating the
capability of the intelligence community, not only to ply its craft, but to
organize a conspiracy on its own. Again, the question arises whether disclosing

a source, method, or technique should turn’on whether positive of negative
information becomes available.

nl61. See 44 U.S.C. 2107(7) (authorizing postponement of the release of
xecords if the threat of disclosure "is of such gravity that it outweighs the
public interest"); see also supra note 102 and accompanying text.

Bxhibict Five provides a good indication of the kinds of issues involved in
dealing with sources and methods. ni82 This document is a cable sent from the
Director of the CIA on November 23, 1963, only hours after the murder of the
President, seeking information about a surveillance operation conducted in
Mexico City. ni83 The message [#30] sought information about what the CIA
operatives: in Mexico City knew about the existence of tapes and transcripts
involving surveillance of the Soviet Bmbassy there. n184 The CIA originally
requested the postponement of much of the information in this document; however,
the Board decided that its centrality to understanding the assassination story
required its release, with the only redaction being the name of. the
authenticating office, whose pseudonym was used in its place. n185 Because it
helps to clarify the issue of whether the CIA taped Oswald's conversations in vo
the Embassy, this document is one of the most significant released by the Board
to date. This document also suggests the CIA's awareness of and interest in
Oswald before he purportedly shot the President.

There is also the question of whether the Board should reveal the identities
of those who handled information relating to the investigation of the uw

assassination. America's intelligence machine is a huge bureaucracy that tm i:
processes information in staggering quantities. nl86 How and by whom information: 3
velating to the assassination was organized, processed, and distribiited is
central to evaluating the CIA's role in the assassination. For example, Exhibit

Six pertains to the continuing debate about whether the Agency photographed

Oswald entering the Soviet Embassy and whether a record of what he had to say

there was ever sent to CIA headquarters. n187 Arguably, ‘unraveling the chain of
custody of that material is critical. Yet, to do so would require identifying

the persons who handled it. In this instance, the Board decided that, on grounds

of personal privacy and potential harm, it would not disclose the name of one

CIA official involved with the Mexico City operation, although the names of

other officials were released in cooperation with the CIA.

X. Foreign Liaison

The American government conducts its intelligence operations in collaboration
with the services of other nations. nl8é For example, the most secret agreement
ever entered into by the English-speaking world is the. pact by which the United
States, Great Britain, Canada, [*31] Australia, and New Zealand carved the a
world into spheres of cryptologic influence, assigning each nation targets and
agreeing to standardize terminology, code words, and other.cperations’
procedures. nl89 Revelations of these and other relationships could prove
extremely embarrassing to the cooperating governments, especially when those
governments profess to be neutral or have publicly stated that they have no
connection with the CIA. However, a full understanding of the intelligence base
upon which the Warren Commission and the intelligence community as a whole
assessed the Kennedy assassination depends on a thorough accounting of such
connections. Moreover, perhaps nowhere else is negative information more
important than when the intelligence service of another country has access to

unique sources. There is, as well, the related. question of how much information
was known at the top of the cooperating governments and the extent to which such
knowledge would enhance our understanding of the assassination as being the work
of foreign conspirators. If we compromise any of those relationships and
consequently cause political damage to the cooperating government, we may find a
valuable future source of intelligence closed. n190

Exhibit Seven poses some of these liaison issues. n191 The FBI provided the
Board with this heavily redacted document, arguing that release of the body of
material in the message from the FBI field office in Paris to the Director of
the FBI in Washington on October 12, 1960 (three years before the
assassination), would damage the ability of the United States to work with the
intelligence and police operations of a foreign nation. The cable, however,
struck the Board as being particularly important, in that it showed that three
years before.the murder of the President the FBI.was engaged in surveillance of
Oswald's activities. nl92 The Board was also concerned that concealing so large
an amount of material would only heighten speculation about the document's
significance.

n192. See id.

As Exhibit Bight demonstrates, the contents of the cable were far more
sinister when redacted than when they were disclosed in full. n193 To gain this
release, the Board sought the cooperation of the Swiss ambassador to the United
States, who consented to the release, only with the proviso that the names of
specific Swiss officials not be divulged. As a result of the cable's release, we
know that the FBI had knowledge of and interest in Oswald's activities well
before the assassination, to the extent of relying on officials of the Swiss
Federal Police to learn about his possible attendance at Albert Schweitzer
College. ni9s4

XI. Of Times and Theories

How to address the host of issues raised by these intelligence materiale depends
on answers to two overriding questions: The first is whether the passage of time
renders open that which currently requires postponement. The second is whether,

by adopting a particular theory about what happened in Dallas, the Board so .
fundamentally shapes ite assumptions about the significance of documents that it
may actually fail to open the most critical of them.

More than a third of a century has passed since the murder of.President te 3
Kennedy. When aske@ whether the sources, methods, and techniques used then are - =~
no longer worthy of protection today, the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies appropriately answer no. n19S They argue that disclosure at any time
will reduce their capabilities and, hence, our national security. ni96 In the
world of intelligence operations, all secrets must live forever, lest we be
unable to find new secrets in the future.

The passage of time, however, has made a difference, and in some instances
dramatically so. There is today no Soviet Union to which Lee Harvey Oswald could
return. If he returned to Minsk, he would find it a capital of an independent
mation, rather than a satellite of the Communist Empire. The Warsaw Pact has
dissolved; the capitals of Eastern Burope now sport ‘trendy shops and capitalist
enterprises; Cuba survives by importing tourists from everywhere but the United
States; and China has emerged as a major American market. Not only is the Cold
War dead, but so too are many of the principal figures in the assassination -
President Johnson, Robert F. Kennedy, John Connally, and Jacqueline Kennedy. The
U-2 is regularly fea- {*33] tured on television documentaries; photographs
from the once super-secret Keyhole surveillance satellites of the 1960s and
early 1970s leap from the pages of the current issues of Scientific American.
nl97 There is no doubt that the CIA, FBI, and military intelligence services
snooped on us and other nations, friend and foe. n196 The CIA in particular
argues that current intelligence activities must remain plausibly deniable and
that the Board's role should be to postpone the disclosure of actione taken a
third-of-a-century ago that conceivably could compromise current operations. Y
Yet, we might reasonably ask ourselves, as the Board has, whether, three decades
later, we would compromise our security interests around the world by indicating
that a CIA station once existed in Moscow.

If the passage of time makes no difference, then the American people would
never have a right to all of the information used or denied by the Warren
Commission. The passage of time neuters secrecy, and eventually, like Douglas
MacArthur's old soldiers, secrets juet fade away. If there are any secrets that
a democratic government has a right to keep permanently from its people, surely
the murder of the President would not be one such secret. .

Then there is the problem of what theory the Board should adopt to explain
events in Dallas. Gerald Posner, for example, has pub- [#34] lished a widely
xead book on the assassination entitled Case Closed. 0199 It concludes that Lee
Harvey Oswald murdered President Kennedy, that he did so acting alone, and that
there is no evidence of a larger conspiracy, foreign or domestic. n200 That
notion of the assassination is countered by a host of critics that insist on
just the opposite. n201

he was a CIA agent, a computer network asking ita members to discredit his book,

The general assumptions the Board holds about what happened inform how it
assesses the value of a particular document to the public. If the Board assumes
that Oswald murdered the President, and consequently looks only for information
that speaks to his role, it is likely,.on national security grounds, to postpone
certain kinds of information. If the Board assumes that the murder was a
conspiracy, then much of what seems irrelevant to the Oswald explanation may
actually have great currency. n202 The intelligence agencies rely on the
[#35] (*36] theory that Oswald did it and that he did it alone. n203 To
support such a position, they turn, ironically, to the findinga of the Warren
Commission, n204 a body that in some ways they attempted to deceive. Perhaps _
there is no better evidence of the CIA's attitude than its effort to sway public esessiees
opinion abroad in the wake of the release of the Warren Commission Report. n205
As Exhibit Nine makes clear, the CIA used its substantial resources to just that
end. n206

n202. The Board adopted a broad definition of an “assassination record" with
just such issues in mind. See 36 C.F.R. pt. 1400 (1995). The pertinent sections
dealing with the scope for interpreting the JFK statute read as follows:

Conclusion

The American public should not rely on the JFK Board to settle the question of “vw

what happened in Dallas and why. That .is not the [*37] Board's mandate. 208

The Board is not charged with answering the question of who murdered President

Kennedy. It is not running an investigation; it is, instead, seeking to disclose

documents in an age of open secrets, an age in which we have come to embrace the

idea that openness is to be preferred and that accountability is the touchstone :
for public confidence in government. 1209 :

in all public matters is highly desirable. n210 Full disclosure is to be
preferred over partial; the full truth is better than something less, and the
more we know about what government has done, is doing, and plans to do, the more
secure we will be in our liberties. Yet, the intelligence community charged with
making the case for secrecy often dees so as a matter of routine rooted in
tradition. n211 Secrecy in a democracy deserves better; it cannot be an end in (il
itself, and it certainly cannot be justified simply to obscure the intelligence
services that generate much of it in the first place. Such an approach is
ultimately self-defeating, both for the intelligence community and for the
government it serves.

n210. See, e.g., Weiner, supra note 140 (discussing the CIA's slow release of
its files on the most important covert actions of the Cold War). The argument in
support of openness and accountability in government is advanced carefully by

America (1974). oe

George Bernard Shaw was correct when he argued: "There are no secreta better
kept than the secrets that everybody guesses." n212 Shaw's words surely describe
the approach of the intelligence agencies to the Kennedy assassination. In the
absence of disclosure, the public, goaded by a news-hungry press and an activist
research community, will be left to speculate in sensational ways about the
assassination. Such speculation will continue to have predictably corrosive
consequences.

We should all be stunned that, with countless documents still hidden in
government filing cabinets, researchers, newspaper reporters, [+38]
columists, and movie and TV producers have managed to convey a broadly held
view that the Warren Commission failed and that the government knows more than
it is telling. n213 We should stand in awe of their capacity to explain the
assassination in such breathtaking terms when so much still remains. under lock

clandestine CIA and FBI operations, a fuller record will put to the test the
most sinister of all conspiracy theories: that the President was murdered by his
own government. Such a matter cannot be left to chance explanation because it
eats away at the foundation of public confidence in government, which neither
well-intentioned secrecy nor covert operations can restore.

Americans have been left guessing about the Kennedy assassination since the

secret - and that is how the intelligence business operates. n215 In the case of

to accept on a principled basis the importance of secrets in a democracy and to
protect what is truly valuable and in the public interest to keep secret. Only
then will it be possible to assess whether charges of a conspixacy to murder.

Assassination Records Review Board
Guldelines for Review of Postponements in the Segregated Collections
Adopted: April 23, 1997

Background oe

In order to ensure that the Review Board will be able to complete its task of reviewing

all identified assassination records, the Board recently took two significant steps.” First,

on November 13, 1996, it adopted guidelines with respect to reviewing “Segregated

Collections” with regard to information that is “not believed relevant” (NBR}-to the

assassination. Second, in February 1997, the Review Board requested Congress to
extend its tenure for one additional year.

It is the Review Board's judgment that, even with the assumption that our operations
may be extended through Fiscal Year 1998, the Review Board cannot hope to complete
review of postponements in the Segregated Collections under the current method of
review. In particular, a reasonable modification of current postponement standards
would greatly expedite and facilitate the release of additional information and records.

* Otherwise, the Review Board might cease operations without having reviewed claimed

postponements in tens of thousands of pages of FBI and CIA records.

Postponement Criteria for the Segregated Collections

In a further effort to enhance the Review Board's work, the Review Board now issues
these revised guidelines for the review of records in the Segregated Collections.'
(These guidelines do not affect the FBI's Core and Related Files or the CIA's 201 file on
Oswald.) The four principal factors that underlie these review guidelines are: first,
continuing, to the greatest reasonable extent, the Review Board's established
guidelines for postponements that have emerged over the past two years; second,
establishing guidelines consistent with the Review Board's decision regarding NBR
records; third, establishing reasonable and workable guidelines that will enable the

'The regulations adopted by the Board on November 13, 1996, define
“Segregated Collections” as including first, FBI records that were requested by: (a) the
House Select Committee on Assassinations (“HSCA’) in conjunction with its
investigation into the Kennedy assassination; (b) the Church Committee in conjunction
with its inquiry Into issues related to the Kennedy assassination; and (c) by other bodies
(e.g., Pike Committee, Abzug Committee, etc.) that relate to the Kennedy :
assassination; and second, CIA records including (a) the CIA's Sequestered Collection
of 63 boxes as well as one box of microfilm records and the microfilm records (box 64),
and (b) several boxes. of CIA staff “working files.”

Review Board, the ARRB staff, the CIA, and the FBI to complete the significant amount
of work that remains; and finally, to provide reasonably consistent standards for the
review of postponements that would apply equally to CIA and FBI records.

The following are, in summary form, guidelines for reviewing postponements In the
Segregated Collections.”

CIA Source and FBI informant and National Security Asset Postponements

There are, of course, similarities and differences between FBI informants and CiA,
sources, Like FBI informants and national security assets, CIA sources may or may'not
be paid for the information that they provide and they may or may not be providers of
Information over the long-term. When providing Information to the Bureau, FBI
informants generally are understood to be cooperating with law enforcement officials for
a legal and legitimate purpose. It is often the case, although not always, that FBI
informants understand that at some point their name might surface in conjunction with a
criminal prosecution and that they may need to testify in court. Foreign CIA sources.
and FBI national security assets, however, are not necessarily deemed to be
cooperating with law enforcement officials but may, in fact, be committing the crime of
espionage. against their native country by cooperating with US authorities. Furthermore,
unlike FBI informants, CIA sources and FBI national security assets presume that thelr
names will not be released publicly and they certainly presume (in the ordinary course)
that their identities will not surface in criminal trials. As a practical matter, it is generally
much easier today for the FBI to locate a former informant who resides in the United
States than it Is for the CIA and FBI to locate former sources and national security
assets.

Despite these differences -- differences which would generally suggest a greater
degree of protection being owed to CIA sources and FBI national security assets —- the
issues in terms of postponements are fundamentally similar.

*The existing “NBR” guidelines allow the Review Board to remove from detailed
consideration those records or files that truly have no apparent relevance to the
assassination. Nevertheless, a significant number of files in the Segregated Collections
contain records that shed some light on issues that the HSCA explored as potentially
relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy. : The following criteria would apply
to all records In the Segregated Collections, including records containing some NBR
redactions.

CIA Sources “

The Review Board established guidelines, during its December 1996 meeting, for
handling CIA source issues and applied those guidelines at the January 1997 meeting.
These guidelines di directed the protection of names and identifying Information of CIA...
sources in cases where the identity of the source is of low public interest or Is peripheral
to the JFK assassination. The Board's decision was based on two factors: the concem
that since CIA sources generally live outside the United States, they could risk ham if
their identities were revealed. Moreover, many of the sources referenced in =
records appear infrequently and are of relatively low public interest. Therefo;

records where the identily of the source Is of importance for understandi he 5
assassination, the CIA will be required to provide additional evidence to support the:
protection of the source's Identity.S In cases where the identify of the source is
peripheral to the assassination story, the information will be postponed until 2017.

FBI National Security Assets
FBI national security assets should be treated in the same manner as CIA sources.
FBI informants

Informant issues represent the largest category of postponements in the FBI's
Segregated Collection, as they do in the “core” FBI assassination files, They also
provide the greatest opportunity for streamlining the review process. Currently, there
are ten members of the Bureau’s JFK Task Force who are responsible for researching
individual informants in response to evidence requests from the Review Board.‘ They
retrieve and review the informants’ files and attempt, through DMV, Social Security, and
other database searches, to determine if the informant is alive. Under current Review
Board standards for “core” files, this work is necessary to provide evidence to support
tedacting the informant’s name, regardless of whether the informant provided
information. Removing the requirement of proving whether informants are alive in the
Segregated Collections would free up significant resources that could be deployed to
reviewing unprocessed HSCA subject files.

The new approach to HSCA subjects is to protect informant-identifying information,

3An example would be the case of John Scelso (pseud.), The Board found that
his identity is relevant to the assassination story and CIA offered evidence of a
continuing need to protect the identity. In this case, “Scelso” documents would
continue to be scheduled for release in five years.

‘Six work full-time on informant evidence, four devote about half their time to
informant evidence,

without requiring the Bureau to make a showing that the informant is alive. This~’
protection would extend to individuals characterized as symbol-number informants,
“PSls,” “PCls,” “established sources,” “panel sources,” and the like —- designations that
indicate an ongoing relationship with the FBI. It would not extend to individuals who
requested that thelr identity be protected In an isolated contact with the FBI or to local.
and state law enforcement officers.

The “informant-identifying information” to be protected would include the customary
(ie., informant-specific) portions of informant symbol numbers and file numbers,
informant names, and -- at least potentially -- descriptions of, and phelps received
from, the Informant. How much, if any, of the latter type of information shduld' be
redacted would be the principal focus of staff-level discussions With the FBI. The staff's
principal goal in this process, with regard to each informant, would be to release as
much information that is relevant to understanding the assassination as possible. In
discussions with the FBI, the staff would be prepared, if necessary, to concede
redaction of informant-identifying information that is unrelated to the assassination in
order to ensure that. more pertinent information is reledsed.*

The presumption will be that an informant’s identity will be released if the Informant
provides “positive” information about an assassination-related issue. To overcome this
presumption of release for informants with “positive” information, the FBI would need.to
make a particularized showing that the identifying information should not be released.
To the extent that an informant's identity is protected, it will be postponed until 2017,

CIA Employee Name Postponements

Over the past year the CIA has addressed the employee name issue and has released
some names that it had previously asked the Board to postpone. But during that time
the list of names has grown to a size that had not been Imagined at the time the work
began. To date, the Review Board staff has identified in the JFK Collection over 650
names of CIA employees. These names appear in more than 1000 documents already
reviewed by the Board and numerous additional records that have not yet been
processed. While some of these employee names are important to the assassination
Story, many appear only.a few times in the entire JFK Collection and seem to add little,
if any, important information.

‘in HSCA subjects, there typically will not be information about Ruby, Oswald or
the assassination itself. However, ina file on, for example, Sam Giancana, there may
be informant reports on Giancana’s support of anti-Castro activities, and reports from
the same Informant on day-to-day numbers operations in the Chicago area. The staff
would set a higher priority on release of the former reports than on the latter.

-5-

CIA's argument to protect employee names emphasizes a number of. points. First,
since many employees are “under cover,” the maintenance of that cover is critical to
gathering intelligence. CIA argues that identification of a name can identify the cover
provider and jeopardize operations. Second, although the majority of names are of
retired CIA employees, CIA has a confidentiality agreement with them and many do not
want their past Agency affiliation released. The argument here Is that release may ~
jeopardize business relationships or personal safety. Such arguments have already
been presented to the Board.  Their-merit can only be determined on a case-by-case
basis. However, due to'the volume of names in the JFK Collection, the individual
review and evaluation of each case would delay significantly the review of documents
and ultimately lead to less total Information becoming available to the public

CIA has proposed, and the Review Board agrees, that CIA employee names be treated
in a manner similar to that applied to Source names: to postpone until 2017 those
employee names that are of low public interest or are of peripheral interest to the
assassination. It will be presumed that employee names will be released If their
identities are important to the assassination story unless the CIA is able to provide
specific information of.a potential harm of release. (CIA acknowledges the presumption
of release unless specific evidence is provided to the Review Board that harm to
hein security or to personal safety would result from the release of the employee
name.

FBI “Forelgn Counterintelligence” Postponements

Itis presumed that the FBI will, at.least partially, carry over its post-appeal standards for
disclosing “FCI” activities targeting Communist-bloc nations. To the extent that the
HSCA subjects reflect “FCI" activities against other nations that have not been
addressed by the Review Board in the “core” files, the FBI will be allowed to redact
direct discussion of such activities, unless the information in the proposed redaction
meaningfully contributes to the understanding of the assassination.

FBI and CIA Foreign Liaison Postponements

The criteria for these _postponements would not, inthe abstract, depart significantly from
the Review Board's current approach of releasing information received through liaison
channels, while protecting direct acknowledgment of the source of the information. In
practice, however, the staff would be more flexible in protecting text that implies,
although may not unambiguously state, that a foreign goverment Is the source of
particular information. Nevertheless, the more significant the information is to any
assassination-related issue, the more information would be released under these
guidelines.

CIA Stations and Other Issues

Over the past two years the Review Board has establishéd other guidelines that will
continue to guide the review process, some of which will be outlined here. ‘For CIA
stations, all locations related to the Mexico City story will be released during the period”
1960-69. Outside of that window, they will be released on a case-by-case basis should ©
the identity of the station be critical to understanding the assassination. Other stations,
except for those identified as particularly sensitive, will be released from the beginning
of the Kennedy administration until the publication of the Warren Commission report,
(ie., January 1, 1961 to October 1, 1964). Outside of these windows, stations will be
postponed. Cable prefixes, dispatch prefixes, and field report prefixes would be >:
postponed or released according to the same windows as the stations to which they
refer. CIA job titles also are redacted or opened along with the station at which the
officer served.

Crypts would be released along lines similar to other information. All “LI” crypts, except
those considered particularly sensitive would be released through October 1, 1964, as
are “AM” crypts and U.S. government crypts, In other aréas, only the digraph is
protected. Again, the exception is sensitive crypts, which would be protected in their
entirety. After October 1, 1964, the presumption shifts towards protection of the crypts,
except those that provide meaningful information about the assassination story. (For
example, crypts pertinent to Garrison-era documents would likely carry the same
presumption of release as those generated during the Warren Commission.)

Surveillance methods will be released if the nature of the surveillance has a material
bearing on information related to the assassination unless CIA provides evidence
demonstrating the political or operational sensitivity, in which case the information will
be released in 2017,

First, to establish our own working target dates to measure Review Board progress
against the mandatory deadline established by the JFK Act.

Second, to provide CIA with our best assessment of the order and scope of our review. __
so that it can make its own internal judgments on the proper allocation of its resources.
We provided CIA prior drafts of this memo and solicited its specific advice and
suggestions for better ways to accomplish our goals. [We have not asked CIA to
“agree” to these deadlines, but we have encouraged it to provide alternative

suggestions on how best to meet the August 1 deadline.] :

Third, to solicit the Review Board's advice regarding “enforcement” of these (or other)
targets, Although we surely hope that both the ARRB staff and CIA will be able to meet
the targets, and although we certainly plan to make all reasonable accommodations for
problems that no doubt will arise, we nevertheless anticipate that it is possible that CIA
might not be able to keep to these timetables. Thus, we anticipate that there may well
be times when blocks of records scheduled for Board review will not have been fully
processed by CIA. It is our judgment that, in keeping with our commitment to
Congress and to the goals of the JFK Act, we may need to have the Board act on groups
of records for which CIA has not completed its initial review. At the risk of over-
repetition, the ARRB staff seeks to be as reasonable and accommodating as it can on
timetables, provided that any proposed changes are consistent with our obligation to
complete the task. We realize that this review may have resource-allocation

\By establishing this target date, we will provide ourselves with a two-month
cushion to handle possible appeals and miscellaneous issues that doubtless will arise.


consequences for CIA and we expect to refine this timetable both tom i
resource impact and to allow us and the CLA to proceed most efficiently with the :
review. We also.take very seriously our commitment to Congress to.complete our work “ a
on schedule. Is the Board prepared to make decisions on records if CIA has not
completed its review and to enforce those decisions? cay

Il. Issues applying to all CIA record groups

Records to be opened-in-full
During the course of CIA’s review, it frequently identifies secon ti
is prepared to open in full without Board action. AlthGugh there is a

benefit in promptly forwarding such records to NARA, it is less expensive

for CIA to process these records during the summer months.

Accordingly, we are prepared to agree with CIA that it may delay. se
hg such records, provided that all such processing of open-in-full

* records will be completed by August 30, 1998.

Duplicates
CIA will continue to identify duplicates and may process them after all
other documents have beer reviewed and transferred to NARA. If the
ARRB is shown that any given record is a duplicate, CIA need not
complete the processing before September 30, 1998.

The “working files” is a group of records that ‘was assembled
CIA by Russ Holmes.. Although he was not'asked formally by CIA’
to create this separate records group, he did so in order to facilitate:
his work and, perhaps, to satisfy his own curiosity. The group —
contains many original records (copies of some of which are :
already in the collection) and it includes some records of which we :
are aware of no other copies, It is the best-organized collection of
assassination records held by CIA. Its value as a referencétool is
greatest as a collection. Therefore, though the file contains many
duplicates of records found in the JEK collection, the ARRB staff
recommends that it be preserved as asingle group. Duplicates and
open-in-full documents should be treated in the same manner as
they are in the rest of the JFK Collection.’ As with the microfilm
from the Sequestered Collection, the ARRB staff has no objection to
the records being identified on the folder level provided that all
records in the folder are open-in-full.. If there are records in‘which
CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified.
individually. The remainder of open in full’ records may still be
identified with one RIF as being the contents of the same folder.

D. Additional Records

Research, requests, and negotiations continue to identify and

Oswald Office of Security File. As a result of an ARRB staff request
for additional information and records, CIA located portions of a
previously undisclosed Office of Security file on Lee Harvey
Oswald. This seven-volume file, of which six parts have been
located, contains two volumes of press clippings, third agency :
material on Oswald, a copy of Oswald’s address book, and Marina . j

The. Law .

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act was enacted by the-
Congress and signed into law by President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The law states
“All Government records conceming the assassination of eal John F. Kennedy should carry
a presumption of immediate disclosure."

The law mandates that all assassination-related materials be housed in a'single collection in the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

The Act defines five categories of information for which disclosure may be postponed, including
national security, intelligence gathering, and privacy -- provided there is “clear and convincing
evidence" of some harm which outweighs public disclosure. oy
The law requires all federal agencies to make an initial assessment of whether they possess
records relating to the assassination. The agencies themselves will conduct an initial review to
determine whether their records may be disclosed immediately or whether disclosure should be
postponed. The agencies must then give all records that are not disclosed to the Review Board.
The Review Board will then evaluate all agency decisions to postpone the release of records.
Once the Board completes its review of an agency's recommendation for postponement, all
records, including those that have a postponed release date, will be transferred to NARA. The
Act requires that all assassination records must be opened by 2017, with the exception of records
certified for continued postponement by the President.

Authority of the Assassination Records Review Board

The Senate report of The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992 stated that " the underlying principles guiding the legislation are independence, public
confidence, efficiency and cost'effectiveness.” In-order to achieve these objectives, the Act gave
the Board the specific powers to:

* direct government offices to provide identification aids and organize assassination records;

* direct government offices to transmit assassination records to the National Archives;

* obtain assassination records that have been identified and organized by a Government office;

direct government offices to investigate the facts, additional information, records, or testimony
from individuals which the Board has reason to believe is required;

* request the Attorney General to subpoena private persons to compel testimony, records, and
other relevant information;

require any Government office to account in writing for the destruction of any records relating


13-00000 |

to the assassination of President Kennedy;

* receive information from the public regarding the identification and public disclosure of
assassination records; and .

* hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena witnesses and documents.

Background and Need for the Law
On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while traveling in a

motorcade in Dallas, Texas. His tragic death, and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald,
the President's alleged assassin, led to the creation of The Warren Commission, seven days after
the assassination.

7

Amid continuing public doubts that all of the facts surrounding the assassination had. not come to
light, the House of Representatives established the House Select Committee on Assassinations in
1976 to reopen the investigation.

In addition to these two major federal investigations devoted to the investigation of the
assassination of President Kennedy, three other federal investigatory bodies have dealt with the
assassination to some degree. President Ford created The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 to
investigate Central Intelligence Agency activities within the United States. Part of the
Commission's efforts related to the Kennedy assassination. Also in 1975, Congress created the
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities (the Church Committee) and the House Select Committee on Intelligence (the Pike
Committee). Some of the work of these committees was related to the assassination.

Despite these official investigations and with private researchers continuing their efforts, the
public was not satisfied that all of their questions about the assassination of President Kennedy
had been answered. The result was the passage of The President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992, which included the creation of the Assassination Records
Review Board.

Contacting the Assassination Records Review Board
The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 provides that the

Review Board has the authority to “receive information from the public regarding the
identification and public disclosure of assassination records."
