later did graduate work

at Berkley in California and at

Atthetime aftheassars coas

the University of Paris. Indiate, Elena had bony been mar-

ried to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals.

When

Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also named

Elena, has always resided with her mother. ede

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life

in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity about

her native land and had a reputation for being one of its

more articulate detractors

At the same time, Elena was

considerad emotionally committed to any aspects of Mexican

life and made an important contribution to its artistic

development.

iste

?.

In the 1960's Elena became

significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Señora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciate audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexi-

co. Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume

called La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of

the London Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de

Porvenir, "a spendid success." Critics have said of her:

"For Elena Garro, there is not frontier between reality

and fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality-

perhaps more intense--to which one may penetrate without

passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of

a literature fired with passion, flavor and life." Many

people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier

between reality and fantasy is also difficult for her to

distinguish

in real life. (Biography Data Form on Elena

Garra de Paz prepared by Charles Thomas.)

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (CNC) , the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI) . Because Ms. Garro

was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the

poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all

over the country. (Ibid.)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her fairy

immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968.

Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her

daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations has been unable

to determine the exact reason Ms. Garro had for fleeing

Mexico.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been friendly

with Embassy officers. Her broad range of significant

Attached to the memo was a note from Flannery to

the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which read, "Do you

want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott

then noted that the memo should be filed. The file indi-

cations show that the memo went into the Oswald "p" file

and the Elena Garro "p" file. (Ibia.)

informant (The House Select Committee has been unable to

Elena was questioned regarding the identity of

other persons attending the party at the Ruben Duran home

Americans. Elena stated that in the course of the party

Charles Thomas' First Meeting with Elena Garro Where Lee

Harvey Oswald is Discussed

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer at

the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a conversa-

tion with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587, WX-7241 Entry

No. 425, p. 91, CIA No. 718.) The meeting with Elena had

been about other matters but she mentioned knowing Oswald.

Thonas noted that she was reluctant to talk but ahalfbid.)

(Cuban Consul in Mexico City), Emilio Carballido (a pro-

Communist writer-friend of the Durans), and a Latin Ameri-

can Negro man with red hair (unidentified) were at the

party. A marginal comment by this entry in WX-7241

says, "How did Elena know about a red-haired Negro?"

Elena also told Thomas that she had later learned that

Silvia Duran had been "Oswald's mistress while he was

there." (A note by this entry in WX-7241 says, "How

did Elena Garro know about Silvia being the mistress of

Oswald?? This is 1965.") The Mexico City Station did not

hear about the Oswald-Duran "affair" until July 1967

when a CIA Asset Liringß reported it. LAfter reviewing

"Assassins" and other insults at the Embassy employees.

That same day a friend, Manuel Calvillo, an official in

she wanted to tell her story to the American Embassy.

(Ibia.) Calvillo dissuaded her by telling her that the

American Embassy was full of Communist spies. (Ibid.)

Charles Thomas' Meeting with Elena Garro on December 25, 1965

Thomas

met with Elena again on December 25, 1965.

The same date he wrote a memorandum of conversation which

provided a much more detailed restatement of Ms. Garro's

alleged encounter with lee Haryey swald and subsequent

developments.

(CIA Nos. 580-583; Wx-7241, Entry #427, p. 92,

CIA #719)

Elena admitted that she had spoken to two men at the

Embassy, "presumably from the Legal Attache's Office."

lIbid, The meeting occurred on Nov. 24, f964.) Elena

said that she did not tell them the complete story because

"the Embassy officers did not give much credence to any-

thing she and Elenita said." (CIA Nos. 580-583; Wx 7241,

Entry #427, p. 92, CIA #719)

She

stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's

home. (Ibid.) She was unclear about the date of the party.

(Ibid.) It was a few days before the Soviet Astronaut,

Gagarin, visited Mexico; she thought that this would put

the party around September 2 or 3, 1963. (Ibid.) She be-

lieved that the party was on a Monday or Tuesday because

it was an odd night for a party. (Ibid.) Elena could not

check her calendar to refresh her memory at the time of

the interview because the calendar was in a desk that had

been stored away. (Ibid.)

HW 50955 DocId: 32263506 Page 15

## Page 16

-15 -

During the conversation Elena described Oswald

and his companions. (Ibid.) The man who she thought

was Oswald wore a black sweater. (Ibid.) She said he

was quiet "and

stared a lot at the floor." (Ibid.) One

of his companions

"was very tall and slender and had long

blond hair which hung across his forehead. He had a

gaunt face and a rather long protruding chin." (Ibid.)

The other companion was also tall, with short, light

brown hair and no distinguishing characteristics. (Ibid.)

The three Americans did not dance or mix with the other

guests. (Ibid.) Elena saw the same three men on the •

street the next day. (Ibid.)

Elena was certain that Eusebio Azcue, Horacio Duran,

Silvia Duran, Lydia Duran, Deba Guerrero, General Clark

Flores and his mistress, a doctor from Dalinde Hospital,

a young American couple who were honeymooning in Mexico,

and several other people were at the party. (Ibid.) . She

said that Ricardo Guerra, whom she claims converted Horatio

Duran to Communism, and his wife, Rosario Castellanos,

were suppoed to be at the party but did not attend. (Ibid.)

Elena alleged that the red-haired man and Emilio

Carballido were not at the party that Oswald attended but

at another party where Carballido and Azcue got into a

heated argument about President Kennedy. (Ibid.) "They

came to the conclusion that the only solution was to kill

was before or after the party where she met Oswald. (Ibid.)

The House Select Connittee has been unable to confirm the

between Azcue and Carbêllido.

conversation.

Eusebio Azcue stated that it did not occur.

Elena said that Carballido "is a known Castro agent

in Mexico." (Ibid.) After the assassination he spent a

year in Cuba. (Ibid.) He then got a job teaching at Rutgers

University through Dr. Jose Vaszuez Amaral. (Ibia.) The

House Select Committee has been unable to confirm Ms. Garro's

allegations.

why?

Elena reiterated that the incident at the Cuban Em-

bassy, where she and her daughter shouted "Assassins," etc.

at the Embassy employees, occurred on November 23 at or

about 3:00 p.m. (Ibid.) Elena and Elenita were driven to

the Cuban Embassy by Elena's brother who was embarrassed

by their behavior. (Ibid.) This occurred before they had

seen photographs of Oswald. (Ibid.)

Ms. Garro claimed that later in the day she and Elenita

were visited by Manuel Calvillo who told them that they were

in serious danger from the Communists and that he would

take them to a small hotel, where they would be safe, for

a few days. (Ibid.) Elena said she trusted and believed

Calvillo because he was a known undercover agent for the

Mexico Government. (Ibid.) He was also a friend of Noe

Elena could not remember the name of the hotel so

that same day (12/25/65) she took Thomas to the section

of Mexico City where she thought it was. (Ibid.) They

found the hotel. (Ibid.) It was the Vermont Hotel, Calle

Vermont 29. (Ibid.) Elena said that she assumed that

Calvillo had registered them as relatives or friends. (Ibid.)

They satyed at the hotel until the following Friday,

November 30, 1963, hardly leaving their rooms. (Ibid.) (See

Legal Attache report, p.

while

Elena claimed that/she and Elenita were at the hotel

they saw the photos of Oswald and realized that he had

been the man at Ruben Duran's party. (Ibid.) When Calvillo

visited them at the hotel Elena told him that she wanted

to report it to the American Embassy, however, Calvillo

dissuaded her by stating that the American Embassy was

full of Communists. (Ibid.) Elena stated that when she

returned home, guards were posted outside. (Ibid.) The

House Select Committee has been unalie to confirm the

his memorandum of December 25, 1965. (State Department:

Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary

of State, July 25, 1969)

In addition, Thomas wrote that

the only person to speak to him about the December 25,

1965 memorandum, Clarence Bonstra (Deputy Chief of Mis-

sion, State Department, Chief of Affirs at the time of

President Kennedy's assassination and subsequent Oswald

investigation) told him that Oswald had not been in Mexico

on the date given for the party. (State Department: Letter

from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary of State,

July 25, 1964) Thomas noted that even when he reiterated

that Elena had not changed her story but rather that she

had now given a more accurate account, Boonstra stated that

the date was wrong and dismissed the entire affair. (Ibid.)

One of

The Mexico City Legatls Officé, Nathan Ferris, in

reply to Thomas' letter and memorandum, asserted that

Thomas' office had been advised by memoranda dated Decem

ber 27, 1965 and February 23, 1966 that since Elena Garro's

allegations had previously been investigated without sub-

stantiation, no

further action was, being taken concerning

her recent repetition of those

allegations. (FBI Report,

9/30/69, pp. 3-4, JFK Doc. No. ) In their report, the

Legat's Office concluded that either the Counselor for Poli-

tical Affairs did not route the memoranda to Charles Thomas

or that Thomas did not recall receiving them. (Ibid.)

House Select Committee on Assassinations' Investigation of

Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investi-

gated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews and

personal interviews. The Committee requested and reviewed

the CIA's, FBI's and State Department's files, when

available, on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz,

Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp;

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia

Duran, Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio

Azcue, and Emilio Carballido.

Only the Elena Garro de

Paz file contained information on her allegations. Though

all the names listed above played a role in Elena Garro

de Paz' story, not one of their files included a reference

to Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence

Agency's LICOOKIE I, LICHANI I, LIRING 3, LIHUFF I and

TICHBORN files. Once again, not one of the files included

a mention of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select

committee on Assassinations learned that McooKIE I was

also told Elena that Sylvia Duran had been ar-

rested before this fact had become public knowledge. (Ibid.)

since file review was inconclusive, the committee

decided to arrange interviews in Mexico with Sylvia Duran,

Elena Garro, Elenita Garro, Horacio Duran, Ruben Duran,

Lynn Duran, Emilio Carbillido and Betty Serratos. The

Mexican Government informed the House Select Committee on

Assassinations that Elena

and Elenita Garro disappeared

in 1968 during the student uprisings and have never re-

turned to Mexico. The officials stated that Elena and

her daughter might be

in Spain. (See Mexico City Proce-

dural Write-up Trip 1.) The Mexican government reported

that Emilio Garballido could not be found. (Ibid.) The

others were interviewed between June 1 and June 6, 1978.

(Ibid.)

Betty Serratos, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran, and Horatio

Duran all stated that Elena was not the dancing type and

therefore did not attend any of the twist parties at the

Duran homes. (See: HSCA Interview of Betty Serratos,

attended twist parties at the Duran homes, she recalled

All the Durans denied that Lee

Agency to arrange staff interviews with LICHANT/1 (Manuel

Calvillo), LICOOKIE/1 (June Cobb), along with, a list of

other assets who may have had information related to Lee

Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (

The Central Intelligence Agency declined to aid the Com-

mittee in this aspect of the investigation. (why?)

The Committee returned to Mexico City and attempted

to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel Calvillo. (See Proce-

dural write-up Trip 2 Mexico City). The results of the com-

mittee's work were as follows: 1) The Mexican government

told the Committee that June Cobb Sharp received a tourist

permit, number 72781, on June 27, 1947 when she entered

Mexico through Nuevo Laredo. She asked, but was deneid,

permission to represent the magazine, Modern Mexico. On

June 21, 1948, she received a courtesy permit, number 25556.

that there is a possibility that this information is incor-

rect. According to Ms. Cobb's CIA file she worked for the

agency as an asset in Mexico from 1961 through 1966. (CIA

Report, 1965, June Cobb file, 201-

stated that Ms. Cobb resided at her home in 1964. (Supra
