Director Sec'y _

At 9:55 a.m. on July 3, 1975, former Assistant Director

Ivan _Conrad telephonically advised me that he has been contacted and

requested to appear for interview by the Senate Select Committee during

the week of July 7, 1975, concerning Martin Luther King. Mr. Conrad

expressed great concern about his appearance for such an interview and

requested guidance.

I told him that the Director was cooperating with the Committee

in their inquiry, but that in regard to matters that would identify informants,

affect current operations, or compromise very sensitive techniques any

testimony may require limitation to members of the Committee or to the

Chairman rather than stäff interviewers.

Mr. Conrad then asked whether he should respond in the

event questions were raised concerning sensitive matters regarding the

U.S. mails. I told him that in the event questions were asked which

appeared to be beyond the scope of the subject matter indicated for the

interview, or which in his judgment would involve the three areas of

concern expressed above, it would be appropriate for him to request a

recess for the purpose of consulting with the Bureau.

Mr. Conrad inquired as to his possible criminal liability and

whether the FBI would furnish him counsel. I explaited to him the difficulties

imposed by conflicts of interest in that regard and that the FBI could not

furnish him personal counsel. I told him that if he felt the need for advice

as to his personal status, he should consider obtaining the services of a

personal counsel. He said that he would consider that and that although he

was specifically not-making a request at this time, he would consider in the

future requesting that the Bureau pay for his private counsel

Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. Conrad was cordial and said he understood fully that

I was not in a position to furnish him legal advice. I suggested that he

contact the Bureau prior to his appearance for the interview in order to be

advised formally as to his release from the Bureau employment agreement

concerning secrecy and he agreed.

Director Sec'y -

This is to record inquiry received from Mr. Leon

Ulman, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal

Counsel, and recommend response to him.

On 7/22/75, Mr. Ulman called Assistant Director -

Legal Counsel J.A. Mintz to request assistance concerning

an assignment he had been given by the Attorney General (AG)

relating to the current investigation being conducted by the

Senate Select Committee (SSC). In accordance with Mr. Mintz'

referral to our Senstudy project group, Mr. Ulman was contacted

7/22/75 by Supervisor J. P. Thomas.

Mr. Ulman said that the

AG had requested his office to prepare, by 7/25/75, the fullest

possible response to the question, "To what extent has the AG

been involved in consideration or approval of policies and

activities of U.S. foreign and military intelligence agencies?"

Mr. Ulman said that he had requested the Criminal Division

of the Department to conduct research on this matter but, being

unfamiliar with foreign intelligence matters, desired to know

whether we could in any way assist him. He was informed that

the FBI is basically not a U.S. foreign intelligence agency.

He responded that some of our operations involve foreign

intelligence and again asked if we could assist. He was told

that we certainly could not furnish any full answer, but would

attempt to see if we could contribute something to his assign-

ment.

that he sonsider

contacting Mr. K. William O'Connor,

coordinating many

aspects of the SSC investigation for the Department, and might

be able to clarify the request or contribute to the respassem

and that he consider contacting CIA. He indicated hedid not

feel that contact with CIA would be productive.

It wasb agle&8 1975

that the inquiry appears to relate to the AG institutionally

rather than to any involvement of the incumbent, Mr. Levi.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

Inquiry of Intelligence Division personnel, who

might have pertinent information, developed the following

information which might be offered to Mr. Ulman: (1) The

only specific instance in which we are aware that the AG is

involved in consideration or approval of activities of the

FBI regarding foreign intelligence is that when we desire to

effect electronic coverage, for ourselves or on request of

another agency, for the purpose of obtaining positive foreign

intelligence information or foreign counterintelligence

purposes, we seek the approval of the AG. Other agencies

might do likewise. (2) The National Security Act of 1947,

approved by the President 7/26/47, created the National Security

Council (NSC): NSC Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 1 was

revised on 7/7/49 and added the FBI as a member of the

Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC). By a subsequent revision

of NSCID No. 1 on 9/15/58, IAC became the United States

Intelligence Board (USIB), with the FBI still a member. USIB

concerns itself with foreign intelligence matters.

However,

inasmuch as the FBI itself is a member of USIB, and historically

the FBI has not coordinated USIB matters with the AG, the

Bureau's role in USIB is not considered pertinent to the

inquiry regarding the involvement of the AG in foreign intelligence

matters. (3) Our records indicate that prior to the establishment

of the NSC, former FBI Director Hoover recommended that the

AG be a member of the committee which later became the NSC.

Apparently the National Security Act of 1947 did provide for

the AG to attend NSC meetings as a member if the President sọ

desired. Our records indicate the AG did attend some NSC

meetings as a member during the 1947-48 period. However, by

memorandum 8/19/49, AAG Peyton Ford informed Mr. Hoover that

the AG could no longer attend NSC meetings as a member because

of the amendment to the National Security Act made by Section 3

of Public Law 216, 81st Congress, approved 8/10/49. (4) On

11/5/71, the White House announced the establishment of the

such as the recent revision of

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Delipayan

National Security Council Intelligence Committee (NSCIC)

with the AG as a member.

The President's 11/5/71 memorandum

stated the NSCIC "will give direction and guidance on national

substantive intelligence needs and provide for a continuing

evaluation of intelligence products from the viewpoint of the

intelligence consumer."

Assistant AG Robert Mardian attended

a meeting of NSCIC on 12/14/71 as the AG's representative.

We cannot document it, but the recollection of FBI personnel

involved in NSCIC affairs is that Mr. Mardian reported thereafter

to the AG that NSCIC activities did not concern the Department

and that neither the AG nor Mardian were subsequently involved

in NSCIC affairs. On 4/24/74, the AG was still listed as a

member of NSCIC. However, in August, 1974, FBI inquiry of a

member of the U. 'S. intelligence committee staff elicited the

opinion that the AG was no longer considered to be a member

of NSCIC because the AG's office had not been participating in

NSCIC affairs or attending its meetings; further, the AG was

not among the addressees of papers being sent out in preparation

for the next NSCIC meeting:

However, it appears that the AG

may still be nominally listed as a member of NSCIC. (5) It

might also be useful for Mr. Ulman to consult Mr. Kevin Maroney

of the Internal Security Section of the Department inasmuch as

Mr. Maroney has long been involved in matters relating to

internal security and foreign intelligence, and may be aware

of the extent of the AG's involvement.

ACTION:

With your approval, Office of Legal Counsel will

convey the information in the preceding paragraph to Mr. Ulman,

who said he can be contacted by telephone on 187-2051.

He

requested an expeditious response.

INTRODUCTION

Although

the term "revolutionary protest

movement" cannot be precisely defined because of the

amorphous hature of such movements, it can be said

"wi that revolutionary protest movements.existing vithin the !'"

United States fall into two broad categories, i.e: the

"rieNew Leit movement

and the black extremise movement.

The New Leit movement, which grew out of the

Their

stated aims and abjcotivos are simple; they are dedicated

to the total destruction of our traditional values and

democratic sysiem of government.

=====

-.

The New Left movement in this country is clearly

an integral past of a vorld-wide revolutionary movement of

students and young intellectuals. There is a definite

sinilarity of

goals, a uniformity of action from country to

country, and a rapport among leftist organizations and

individuals in

this and foreign countries:

Like the New Left movement; the black extremist

movement in the United States can be traced to the civil rights

movement of the early 1960s and the violent

response to civil

rights agitation.

This is best seen in the history of the

Student Honviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), formed in

1900 In Atlanta, Georgia.

SNCC was one of the moving forces

behind the freedom Riders of the carly 1960s and was the targe

of Ku Klur Klan violence.

In May ,.

The lack of progress toward

OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Historically, the United States

has

been the

target for subversive

activities emanating from and directed

by the international communist movement in regard to efforts

to: tonent disorder and disruption in a revolutionary vein,

The change from the monolithic nature of the movenent to

polycentrism only served to magnify the problem in that it

diversified the subversive attack:

Regardless of the diversification, the basic natuce

of the attack renained the same.

It, emanated from communist

and was channeled

into this country through

communist-bloc diplomatic establisments and old-line communist

groups and organizations working to advance international

in regard to countering these subversive thrusts

there were

two significant factoes which enabled us to nount effective

counterintelligence operations.

The firsi factor was that the activities themselves,

situation which lent itself to errective unlization ot

manpower for coverage and counterintelligence purposes.

The second factor was

engaged in by organizations

that the activities vere

such as the crust, which were

rightly secuctured organizationally in the traditional pattesn

of communist parties

throughout the world.

As such, -they

-presented clear-cui targets for informant penetration.

Because these old line organizations also followed

the traditional pattern of operating under the concept of

acmocratic centcalism with an insistence on rigid discipline

throughout pasty ranks, high-level informant penetration

provided an insighi into strategy and tactics being considered

at all levels. Here,

too, it was possible to effectively.

negate their thrusts.

The emergence of the New Left and black extremist

movements in out society dastically. altered the situation

they evolved mostly out of social reform novenents which

ancseasingly have been icansformed into hard-core revolutionary

moyenchis dedicated to the total destruction of

our domocratic

They produced a new breed of revolutionaries whose

Ison the inception of these movements,

the FBI

has been aware of the fact that theis increasingly revolutionary

communist imprint posed new and unique problems for the

internal security of this nation.

As these forces of covolutionary protest hardened

in their resolve to accomplish their purpose, more and moxe

they reached out in join hands with and seek

support from

• Old-line communists not only inside our country but also

In effect, the pictuce has changed fron one in

communist focess sought out supporters

within our country to carry out their objectives to one

in which domestic revolutionaries ace reaching our sceling the

support of anyone, including comunists, throughout the world

Since the objectives

of both so cloarly coincide, it

INTRODUCTION

Although

the tern "revolutionary protest

"movement" cannot be precisely defined because of the

amorphous. nature of such movements, it can be

said

that revolutionary protest movementssexisting within the

Untied states fall into two broad categories, i.e: the

Te New Left

movement and the black exixemist movement

8222;

The New Leit movement, which grew out of the

civil rights struggle of the 1950s, is a loose-knit,

Sundasciplined group of individuals who view our system.of.

government as iredeemably corrupt and oppressive.

Their

stated aims and objectives are simple; they are dedicated

to the total destruction of our traditional values ano

"denocratic system of government

Finit in ?

vit

The New Left movement in this country is clearly

an integral past of a world wide sevolutionary movement of

students and young intellectuals.

There is

a definite"

similarity of goals, a uniformity of action

from country to

country,

and a rapport among leftist organizations and

individuals in this and foreign countries:

i-is

Like the. New

Lest movement; the black extremist

movement in the United states can be traced to the civil rights

movement of the early. 1960s and the violent response to civil.

rights agitation.

This is best seen in the history of the

Student. Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), formed in

1960 in Atlanta, Georgia.

SNCC was one of the moving forces

behind the Freedon Riders of the early 1960s and was the target

of Ku Klux. Klan violence.

In Mays 1966, Stokely Carmichael was

elected chairman of

SNCC.

The lack of progress toward integration

since the 1954 school desegregation decision helped Carmichael

to. change. SNCC from a

nonviolent group to a full-blown black

revolutionary organization. Other black nationalists took up

.:Carmichael's Cry

for a "bloody revolution" and a proliferation: c"

of black extremist groups seized the initiative for change. from

established civil rights organizations and now advocate outright

and destruction of our form of government.

Foreign communist support of revolucionary

in a number of ways..

Since the Coumunist Party, USA; is

Sinilarly, the Progressive labor Party and

Other traditional chonnois which can

Within the past year leaders of the CPUSA in the

Midwest met with leaders of the

recruitment of these individuals into the CPUSA. These over.

When it was

proposed that there

SDS -and the CPUSA, the SDS leaders replied that the CPUSA is

not involved

in SDS collectives because the CPUSA has nothing

;to contribute.

Subsequently, a leader of the SDS in conversation

with leaders of the CP of Illinois stated that

allegiance to the thought of hao Ise-tung and the Communist

Party

of China.

for over a year in an

with the PLP and is seeking to discredii PLP in the eyes of

OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Historically, the United States has been the

target for subversive activities emanating from and directed

by the international comnunist movement in regard to efforts

-to foment disorder and disruption in a revolutionary vein:

The change from the monolithic nature of the movement to

polycentrism only served to magnify the problem in that it

a versiried the subversive attack.

Regardless of the diversification, the basic natuce

of the attack remained the same.

It emanated from communist

forces

abroad

and was channeled into this country through

communist-bloc. diplomatic establishments and Old-line communist

-groups and organizations working to advance international

Communist

objectives

.227 2-15

From the standpoint of the FBils responsibilities

cin regard to countering these subversive

thrusts. there were

:.."

tivo significant factors which enabled us to nount effective.

counterintelligence operations:

The first factor was that the activities themselves,

tooks place for the most part within our borders.

It was

misituation which lent itselt to effective utrlivation of ci

anpower for coverage and counterintelligence purposes

The second factor vas that the activities vere

engaged in by organizations,

such as

the CrusA, which

Were

lightly structured organizationally in the traditional batter

of communist pacties

throughout the world.

As such, they

presented clear-cut targets for informant penetration.

""Because these old line organizations also' followed

r.?.

the: traditional pattern

of operating under the concept of

democratic centralism with an insistence ou rigid discipline

throughout party

ranks, high-level informant penctration

provided an insight into strategy and tactics being considered

ai all levels.

Here,

to, it was possible to effectively.

negate their thrusts.

**:.

• The emergence of the New Left and black-extremist

_movements in our society drastically. altored.the situation.

They evolved mostly out of social reform movements which

increasingly have beei transtormed into hard-core revolutionary

The Director approved my memozanduzi of 6/23/69

which advised we were preparing a report for Na, Tom Charles

auston, state Assistant to the President, at his request

regarding our coverage of foreign communist support ot

revolutionary jouth activities in the United States to reach

him by 6/30/69: We advised Mi. Huston such a report would

be fortheoming.

Our report sets forth the traditional chaunel

for conmunist support of revolutionary activity in this

country by the established basic revolutionary groups under

foreign doninacion such as the Communise farty, Usa, and the

•Socialist Workers Party.

We also cover the capabilities of

hostile intelligence operations directed at the United States

by the soviet Union, Cuba and Communist China.

Next me show the never, bolder avenues of support

and direction being utilized by revolutionaries, often

without any attempt to conceal

their purpose.

These include

international conferences which in this period of history

are ostensibly for peace in Vietnam but which elso have the

usual underlying

goal of destroying United States prestige

in woeld attairs.

The ease of international travel. and

comunication with sevolutionary intent by New left and black

extremist adherents Sron the United States and abroad is then

set forth.

The section dealing with our coverage of the above

threats to.our internal security clearly shows our strong

reliance ipon the use of live informants and physical surveillance

techniques contrasted by the light selective and limited use

ce electionie coverage.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE :

FOREIGN SUPPORT FOR REVOLUTIONARY PROTEST

MOVEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES

Our report shows that the FBI has been aware from

the inception of the New Left and black extremist movements

that they

pose new and unique threats to our internal security.

It shows we have readjusted our investigative intelligence

efforts to cope with the new problems created. It stresses

the fact that these movements are developing increasingly

into hard-core revolutionary elements which will demand

still greater attention in the form of increased coverage

as it appears there will be increasingly closer links batween

these movements and foreign communists in the future.

We have prepared a transmittal letter to Mr. Huston

submitting our report.

Inasmuch as this documen't is not going

directly to the President, mo copy is being forwarded to the

Attorney General at this

ACTION:

With your approval, the

attached

report and letter

will be forwarded to Mr. Huston.

PERSONAT AND CONEIDENTIAL

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVE!

FROM:

Tom Charles Huston

Staff Assistant to the President

The President has directed that a report on foreign

Communist support of revolucionary protest movements in this

country be prepared for his study. He has specifically requested

that the report draw upon all the resources available to the

intelligence community and that it be as detailed as possible.

"Support" should be liberally construed to include

all activities by foreign Communists designed to encourage os

assist revolutionary protest movenents in the United States

On the basis of earlier reports submitted to the President

on a more limited aspect of this problem, it appears that ouc

present inteligence correction capaullilies ii mùs dea muy

ibe inadaquate.

The President would like to know what resources

(we presently have targeted toward monitoring foreign Conmunist

support of revolutionary youth activities in this country, hor

effective they are, what gaps in our intelligence exist because

of either inadequate resources or a low priority of attention.

and what steps could be taken, il he directed, to provide

(the maximum possible coverage of these activities.

I have asked CIA, NSA, and DIA to submit their contributions

to me by Monday, June 30 th.

I would appreciate it if the Bureau

would provide their response to the President's request by that

"...

sate -

Since the sureau has primary responsibility in this

srea,

I would like to discuss the matter further wich your staff

I have hau an opportunity to evaluate the initial

THE EXAMINATION OF ALL FIRST CLASS MAIL ENVELOPES ARRIVING AT THE

This informative memorandum records information

telephonically furnished the morning of 7/17/75 to Supervisor

S. F. Phillips, INTD, by former FBI Inspector Donald E. Moore.

At about 11:00 p.m., 7/16/75, Moore received a

telephone call at his residence from a Dave Martin (PH), who

identified himself with the AP (Associated Press) , who asked

Moore if Moore was acquainted with the press accounts of

Director Kelley's press conference on 7/14/75, particularly

as Mr. Kelley's remarks pertained to surreptitious entries,

principally at embassies. Moore told Martin

that he had

read about the matter in the newspapers. Martin asked

specifically about the "New York Daily News" of 7/16/75, and

Moore said he was not familiar with that account, Martin

then referred to the 7/16/75 "Washington Post" article and

referred Moore specifically to the newspaper referring to an

unnamed source. Martin wanted some comment from Moore which

the latter declined to give, Moore advising that any comment

should more properly come from the FBI.

Martin attempted to convince him he should make some

comment by stating that information about this matter would

eventually come out, and Martin was now offering Moore a change

to put the matter in a better light. Martin then asked Moore

if Mr. Kelley was correct in his statement and Moore again

declined to comment. Martin said he thought that the "unnamed

source" referred to in the newspaper was Bill Sullivan

(obviously referring to former Assistant to the Director

vitam Co Sullan. Martan asked Monze if he gend and Life

again Moore gave him a no comment reply. 62-111-37:

Martin then asked whether Joe Purvis was at one

time the sAc in WiO. This being a matter of public record,

Moore said that Purvis had been SAC in WFO. Martin attempted

to determine Purvis' current whereabouts and Moore could be

of no assistance as he actually does not know. Moore was

asked whether Bob Kunkel had replaced Purvis and Moore said

that he thought he had. Martin then wanted to know who Purvis'

predecessor was in WFO. Moore referred Martin to the FBI.

According to Moore, their conversation was cordial but he

sensed that Martin hung up rather abruptly. Moore indicated

that he thought that the Bureau would be interested in the

foregoing and he said that any similar further inquiries made

of him would be similarly reported to us. Moore was thanked

for bringing this matter to our attention.

ACTION:

None. For information.

expiess our appreciation to you for meeting

with us on

Wednesday afternoon.

We recognize the need for the Com-

mittee

to have

a complete understanding of the concerns

of the Department of Justice so that our inquiry can

proceed in the most responsible manner. Our meeting

was extremely valuable in that respect, and you may

be

sure thac we nave given full consideration to your

views.

The Committee has been informed that. Mr. John

T. Elliff, leader of the Domestic Intelligence Task

force, and members of his staff met yesterday with Mr.

K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence

coodination, and members of his staîf to agree upon

procedures for delivery of and access to FBI materials

requested by the Comnittee.

The proposed procedures

which resulted from that meeting are satisfactory to

the Committee.

We are pleased that your staff was able to meét

promptly with our representatives and that they reached

agreement without delay.

The Committee expects that the

proposed procedures will, if implemented, expedite its

work during the coming weeks.

As you know, one of our

major concerns was that all of the problems with the

Committee's outstanding requests for materials

We believe the procedures are an appropriate

and practical accommodation of our mutual interests.

to accomplish the work of the Committee within this

framework.

The prompt resolution of this matter demon:

a spirit of cooperation which we hope will

prevail in all our future relations.

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

I have received your letter of July 15 regarding

access/delivery of documents requested in the Committee's

letter of July 9, 1975.

The following relates specifically

to the procedure

suggested for handling documents on the

so called "Kissinger 17" surveillance, which is also applied

in your letter to materials relating to electronic sur-

veillance of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic

City in August 1964, materials relating to the electronic

survcillance of Di, King, anû jussibly lie 0à C files.

I regard this suggested procedure as a major step

forward and a recognition that previous arrangements were

too cumbersome and time-consuming.

Nevertheless, there

are certain practical problems with the procedure which may

be resolved by interpretation.

For example, I assume that

application of the procedure to the Atlantic City conven-

tion matters does not foreclose the Committee from receiving

for use at its offices actual documents or portions of

documents, as well as summaries. I understand that the

FBI has no objection to providing such documents on this

matter to the Committee for use at its offices.

Therefore, in order that the procedure you suggest

may be applicable to all areas of Committee inquiry claimed

•y the Department to Involve particularly sensitive matters,

it should be interpreted as follows: !

spencommittee starI

will have direct access to all files and materials at FBIHQ:

the Committee starf shall select certain documents from the

files which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiry

and necessary for the examination of witnesses or the es-

tablishment of certain facts during the course of the

inquiry; the FBI shall at that time designate specific

portions of such documents which might jeopardize par-

ticularly sensitive sources or methods; with respect

to such specifically designated portions of documents,

the Committee staff will prepare appropriate excisions

or summaries of the information; the summaries will be

checked at that time with senior Bureau executives to

ensure the protection of particularly sensitive FBI

sources or methods; thereafter, the excised documents

and summaries will be removed

to the Committee's offices;

the Committee staff may check back to the original documents

as extensively as necessary; staff notes on the designated

specific portions of documents will not be removed from

FBIHQ; and Committee members may, of course, at any time

see the documents which the staff has seen.

I believe this interpretation can serve as a work-

able framework for Committee access to particularly sensitive

FBI materials. You may be assured that the Task Force shares

your concern for the need to provide special handling tech-

niques to convey or secure any particularly sensitive

information or materials, as

indicated in the outline for

Inquiry Procedures.

we nope this interpretation will

facilitate the mutual effort by the Committee and

. the

Department of Justice to accomplish this purpose.

I would appreciate receiving your immediate advice

to me as to whether any further interpretation of this

matter is required.

Any public discussion of these arrange-

ments and interpretations should be cast in such terms as

will not jeopardize particularly sensitive FBI sources.

Sincerely,

lohn T. Elliff

ENFORMATION CONCERNING

7/1/75, captioned Colby Report to the President, " advised of a contact

Senorabam won, tegal Counsel to Mr, J. B. Adems, dated

of Legal Counsel by Mir. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the

President, during which Wilderotter advised that the report submitted by -

Director Colby of the CIA to the President dated 12/24/74 which dealt mainly

with the issues discussed in a "New York Times" article of 12/22/74 by

Seymour Hersh has been the subject of an FOIA request by Morion Halperin.

Wilderotter advised that attorneys for CIA had prepared the material for

release and that the material was now in the possession of The White House

for their review.

He suggested that inasmuch as the FBi was mentioned

in some of the material that it would be desirable for the FBI to review the

material prior to its release.

SA Fred J. Cassidy of the Intelligence Division reviewed this

material in Room 110 of the Old Executive Office Building on 7/7/75. This

review determined that the FBI is mentioned throughout the material being

made available to Halperin and that most of the references to the FBI

included in the material appear in the Rockefeller Commission Report which

Repori has been made available to the general public. No EBI sensitive

sources or tochniques are disclosed in the material to be furnished Halgerin.

In reviewing the material, SA Cassidy noted a misstatement in

Vir. Colby's ietter to the President which relates to the CIA mail intercept

project which was in existence from 1953 to 1913. In the Colby letter to the

President he stated that the intercept program was initiated in 1953 and from

its inception was fully coordinated with the FBI which received much of its

product.

The tacts are that we were not advised of the project until 1958

BY MORTON HALPERIN

when we became aware of such a project through postal authorities,

which fact is substantiated in the Rockefeller Commission Report.

The only other item in the material to be furnished Halperin

which could possibly present future concern pertains to a memorandum

captioned "Restrictions on Operational Lists on Americans" which

was issued to ClA employees sometime subsequent to the CIA retrenchment

in activities brought about by allegations concerning CIA's involvement

in domestic activities. This memorandum concerned the discontinuance

of lists maintained on individuals who were of possible operational

interest to CIA such as doctors who studied abroad. The memorandum

noted that if such listing's could not be made by CIA in a non-misunderstandable

manner arrangements should be made for the service to be performed by

the FBI or other service which can legitimately do this function. We

¡maintain no such list and have not been requested by CIA to perform such

la service. Under present day circumstances whether we could legiumately

periorm such tunction is open to question.

Colby Report to the President has been the subject of an FOLA request,

by Morton Falperin, and aitorneys for CIA have been preparing the material

for release. Mir. Wilderotter identifica the Colby report as a 1 or & page

letter addressed to the President dealing with the issues discussed in a news

article by Seymour Hersh. Included with the letter were nine enclosures

all of which were classified. This material has been reviewed and appropriate

deletions made.

Mr. Wilderotter said that the material refers to FBi - CIA

liaison and the Bureau's Legats abroad. He said that be feels that the FBi

should reviery the material prior to its release.

He said that the review

should be done today and that a Bureau representative should call Jay French,

at 145-2845, to arrange for the review which must be done in the Old Executivel/

The Honorable Edward H. Levi

The Attorney General

U. S. Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Nr. Attorney General:

On April 28 I wrote to you concerning certain allegations

contained in Newsweek magazine pertaining to the removal from

the FBI of certain "personal and confidential" or "official and

confidential" files belonging to former Director j. Edgar

Hoover.

The Select, Committee did not receive any acknowledgment

or response to the letter until one month later on May 20, at

which time we received a memorandum from the FBI. That memo

randum was unsigned and stated, in essence, that the fit had no

knowledge of the matter although a former employee might.

A

copy of my letter of April 28, the FBI memorandum and a letter

of transmittal are attached.

As a result of conversations between members of my staff

and representatives of the Department of Justice and the FBI, the

Select Cormittee understood that the May 20 memorandum ended the

matter and that neither the Department nor the Bureau intended

with oux investigation. In its May 14 comprehensive request of

your Department, the Committee had already specified several items

(items 21-23 of Appendix C) related to the so-called "Official

and Confidential" files which you had described in your testimony

of February 27, before the House Judiciary Conmittee. Further-

more, members of our staîf have interviewed a number of persons

knowledgeable about the files maintained by Miss Helen Gandy,

Executive Assistant to Mr. Hoover, part of which apparently were

the "Official and Confidential" files which you had described

in your testimony.

gation of the transfer of the files maintained in Miss Gandy's

office.

The fact that the Department is conducting such an

investigation has been confirmed by representatives of the

Department and the Bureau.

We are pleased that you are investigating the matter and

trust that you now will be able to answer the questions posed

in my April 28 letter. In addition, we would appreciate your

supplying any other information which comes to your attention

on the matter, including, of course, the results of your

investigation. In the meantime, however, our investigation

must continue. In that connection, representatives of the

Department have suggested that we should not interview current

Bureau employees during the course of the Department's investi-

gation. I am sure that you will agree that our investigation

should not be delayed by the pendency of the Department's

investigation. My hope is that we can work together on this

matter and, if you agree, would appreciate your indicating

that restrictions on our proceeding have been lifted.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

sincerely yours,

REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO OFFICIAL AND

CONFIDENTIAL FILES OF FORMER DIRECTOR HOOVER

During a conference with the Deputy Attorney General at

1:45 p.m. on 6/23/75, the Deputy Attorney General requested the

Bureau to prepare summaries of summaries previously prepared

concerning the official and confidential files retrieved from the office

suite following Mr. Hoover's death.

The Deputy described a notebook

containing 164 summaries that had been made available to the Attorney

General. He requested that the 164 summaries be used as the basis

for preparation of summaries that may be made available for review

by representatives of the Senate Select Committee in lieu of direct

Committee access to the original files. He said that names and

identifying data should be deleted from the file summaries in order to

protect personal privacy, but that the material prepared should serve

to explain the statement made by Attorney General Levi concerning his

review of the official and confidential files.

Mr. Adams instructed that this request should be conveyed to

Mr. Bassett and that the summaries should be prepared by the Inspection

| Division. I telephonically advised Mr. Bassett and during a subsequent

conference between Mr. Adams, Mr. Bassett and me, procedures for

preparation of the summaries were agreed upon.

RECOMMENDATION:

The summaries prepared by the Inspection Division should be

turnished to Legal Counsel for transmission to the Deputy Attorney Geff l

Transmitted herewith are three additional requests from the

June 30, which I received yesterday.

The four-page, 21 item, statement of additional documenta-

tion requested in one of the July o, letters, and the June 30, let-

This issue is the subject of my previous

witness

testimony, should be, I think, observed here.

The second July 8, request is simply for Manual pages to be

made available.

Please arrange for the preparation of appropriate documentary

responses to the requests attached. In the event that there is a

serious problem with response to any of the itemized requests, early

advice to me of that fact would be appreciated, so that I can advise

the Committee and attempt to resolve the problem.

Please alert me to any third agency problems which may arise

with. regara to any of these requests; in a cursory examination, no

such problem was patent to me.

However, I realize that there may be

SUBJECT: SSC Notification. of: June 27; COINTEIPRO

Attached is a request for further detailed information from

Senate Select Committee, regarding COINTELPRO, from Mr. Elliff dated

July 1: 1913.

Please note that this matter is considere air characterized

as an "abuse" (see page 21 of enclosures to SSC letter of. June 27,

previously forwarded; accordingly; any Agent interview would be an

"abuse interview subject to the strictures set forth in the "Outline

for Inquiry Procedures" referenced in the SSC letter of June 27.

Because of this, I feel we should discuss the procedures for inter

View which may be sought under page 2, paragraph "Interviews" of

Mc. Elliff's attached letter. It may be that the matter should be

discussed with the Deputy Attorney General as well, after No. Lavi

has responded to the SSC letter of June 27. A significant legal

problem may be presented by the compulsion of Agents' appearance.

Please also note the attached Departmental decision on the interpre-

tation of "demand" in 28 C.F.R., 16.21 et. sed. This decision will

bear on our resolution of the pending legal problem.

In the meantime, please arrange for the preparation of an

appropriate reply' enclosing a collection of appropriate documentary

ALL IBI INFORIATION CONTAINED

28 C.F.R., § 16:21, et. seg. - Action Memorandum

The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in

the C.F.R. sections indicated. Inis omission creates a need for an

Interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the

white House and the senate select Commutee on dune 13, 1915, and a

copy of those procedures les furnished to the Department on June 16,

1975. Ünues those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the

committee to identify witnesses to the Agendy a reasonable time before

the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and jormer

employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in

the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with

a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or

agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Cormittee is required

to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-

ject area; (b) periods of employment; (c) the date set for the intervie.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the

subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it

seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., $ 16.21, et. sea.,

which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request

by any Cormittee staff member to interview any employee, former employee

or other person connected with the Department of Justice.

This Interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit

ness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Department

Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designateo

I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI soul

be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, In coordination

with this offiçe.

The Honorable Edward H. Levi

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

We have received a letter from Clarence M. Kelley, Director

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated July 7, 1975,

requesting to meet with us for a discussion of certain

materials

pertaining to the FBI which were compiled by the

Commission

• on CIA Activities Within the United States and

may now be in the possession of the Select Committee.

The

Committee welcomes this opportunity for discussion with

Mr. Kelley of these and other matters of concern both to

the FBI and to the Committee.

Our reply to Mr. Kelley is

addressed to you because we believe it is essential that

you participate in this meeting in order to arrive at a

mutual understanding among the Justice Department, the FBI,

and the Committee.

Prompt discussion is especially important because of the

Committee's concern about the status of certain requests

for documents.

On May 14, 1975, the Committee wrote to you

requesting documents pertaining

to a number of areas of in-

The status of the May 14 request was considered by

the full Committee on July 8, 1975.

The Committee's review

of the responses to this request indicates that, although

certain documents have been supplied, others in

areas of

the most vital concern

to the Committee are still outstand-

ing.

A summary of the outstanding items from the May 14

request is attached.

July 9, 1975

As has already been made clear to members of your staff,

the failure of the Justice Department and the FBI to

respond fully to the Committee's request has severely ham-

pered our investigative work. Since the Committee is now

receiving excellent cooperation from the white House and

other agencies on highly sensitive matters, and indeed

from the Justice Department and the FBI on assassination

matters, we are at a loss to understand what special diffi-

culties are presented by the May 14 request.

The Committee has concluded that these issues cannot ade-

quately be resolved by further staff discussions and,

accordingly, that the only responsible way to proceed is

for the Committee itself to take up the problem with you

and the Director of the FBI. Therefore, we are pleased

that FBI Director Kelley's request for a meeting gives us

an opportunity to invite you and Mr. Kelley to appear be-

fore the Committee in executive session during the week of

July 14, 1975. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss

the matters of concern to Mr. Kelley and the steps which

might be taken to expedite response to requests for docu-

ments essential to the Committee's inquiry.

The members of the Committee look forward to this meeting

as a way to resolve issues of common

concern in a spirit

of comity between the Executive and Legislative Branches.

Outstanding FBI Documents

General and the FBI of its request for certain documents

"Use of the resources of the FBI to gather

political intelligence. Our review disclosed

a few documented instances in which the Bureau

at times during the course of an election

campaign was requested to provide - and did

indeed provide - information which could be

used as political intelligence information.

In one instance,

this involved a check of FBI

files on the staff of a campaign opponent.

b. "Improper use of the FBI in connection with

the political process.

In a few instances

recorded in Bureau files, an incumbent Presi-

dent caused the FBI to gather intelligence

relating to a political convention under cir-

cumstances that although cast in legitimate

law enforcement terms could-- and some would

say should -- have been suspected of being

politically motivated.

c.

"Use of the FBI to report on certain

activi-

ties of critics of an Administration's policies.

The FBI files document a few instances

in which

an incumbent President caused the Bureau to

report on certain activities of Members of

Congress who were opposed to and critical of

his policies.

d. "Use of information in the FBI files to respond

to or discredit critics.

Again, the Bureau

files document a very small

number of instances

in which derogatory information legitimately

obtained by the Bureau was disseminated to

other members of the Executive Branch to enable

them to discredit their critics.
