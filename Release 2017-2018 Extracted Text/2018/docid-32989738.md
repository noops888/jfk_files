Dote of transcription 8/4/78

ir. HOWARD C,. KENNEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drive,
Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residence telephone number (314)
521-8221.

Mr. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private
investigator and polygraph examiner. He retired from FBI
service on February 28, 1977. Prior to his retirement he
was assigned to the St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954
to the date of his retirement. During 1974 he was assigned
to general criminal matters and worked as a Special Agent
under the supervision of Field Supervisor ROBERT L. BENDER,

. Mr. KSWNEDY's recollection was refreshed regarding an
interview with him at the FBI Office in St. Louis, Missouri,
on July 28, 1978, by SAC ROY B. KLAGER, JR., concerning a
closed St. Louis file 137-16185; more specifically, serial 5
of that file. Mr. KENNEDY recalled having read this serial
in detail, He further recalled earlier discussion on July 28,
1978, concerning a notation appearing on the above serial
which states, "Notify locals of info re killing", and his
earlier reply that in his recollection this comment pertained
to a matter appearing on page 2 of the memorandum and unrelated
to the MARTIN LUTHER KING information.

Mr. KENNEDY was asked if he did in fact disseminate the
information in keeping with the above-cited handwritten
notation. He related that he recalls with reasonable certainty
that he did disseminate the information appearing on page 2
to someone in the St. Louis Police Department whose identity
he does not now recall.

Mr, KENNEDY called further attention to the last paragraph
of page 3 of the memorandum in question which refers to another
killing, unrelated to the MARTIN LUTHER KING matter. Ile
volunteered that this additional unrelated information was also
disseminated, to the best of his recollection, to the St. Louis
Police Department; however, he similarly does not recall to
whom this information was given. ways Sy,

FILE (62-5097) 8/4/78
SAC ROY B. KLAGER, JR.
HSCA

Attention is directed to two FD-302s in this file,
reflecting interviews conducted on 7/23/78 and 8/4/78,
respectively, by me, of former SA HOWARD C. KENNEDY.
Particular attention is directed to the interview with
KENNEDY on 8/4/78 as it pertains to dissemination of
information by him, which information is reflected in
serial 5 of St. Louis file 137-16185. In this interview
of 8/4/73, KENNEDY stated that he recalls with reasonable
certainty that certain information was disscminated by him
to the St. Louis Police Department.

In order to document such dissemination, this is to
record that I personally searched our dissemination control
file, 66~2340, for the months of April through July of 1974
and found no record of such dissemination having been made.

It should be noted that the volume of 66~2340 for the
month of March, 1974, and prior months are no longer maintained
as they have been destroyed under the file destruction program.

fhere is no FD-159 (dissemination form) concerning this
matter contained in 137-16185 or the related file 87-21859.

to speak with O'HARA for the purpose of informing
O'HARA of something. Beyond that, the purpose of
the visit was not explained to this female.

fhis female then stated that she was
alone in the art gallery, but was able to reach
O'HARA by telephone. She did so, and the interviewing
agent spoke with O'HARA. Again, since this contact
was by telephone, O'HARA was informed only as the
female was informed above. The interviewing
agent and O'HARA agreed to meet the following day.

The following day, 7/28/78, the inter-
viewing agent went to O'HARA's above gallery.
Aman claiming to be O'HARA came to the door of
the gallery and refused to admit the agent to
the gallery. He stated that he would not discuss
anything or permit the agent to inform him of
anything without the intervention of his attorney
identified as RICHARD S. JALOVEC, of Chicago,
Illinois.

Thereafter that day, the interviewing
agent contacted tir. JALOVEC and arranged for
JALOVEC to be present while the agent presented
O'HARA with certain papers which would inform
O'HARA of the matters set forth in referenced
teletype. ‘hereafter, O'HARA would have the
option of responding to the interviewing agent
and of discussing the matter with his attorney.
This meeting was arranged for the following day.

Mr. O'HARA had just decided not to appear at the

files of five (5) former informants and to recommend, in
accordance with a decision by the Department of Justice,
that excised copies of these files be made available only
to the HSCA's Chief Counsel and Director.

SYNOPSIS: The HSCA is trying to resolve allegation that
FBI informants reporting on the Invaders, a Memphis youth
gang, acted as "agent provocateurs" in instigating a,
causing King to return to Memphis where he was killed. HSCA /
requested access to FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) files on five ‘f
informants reporting on Invaders. This access was granted ._*
a to HSCA Chief Counsel and Director only as effort to
Z| comprottise with HSCA and assist in resolving allegation.
HSCA then requested access to Memphis Field Office files
on the same informants. This request was denied in Director
letter to Congressman Stokes, Chairman, HSCA, (copy attached)
primarily because it would be detrimental to our informant
development program. By letter to the Attorney General from
HSCA Chairman dated 7/5/78 (copy attached), a meeting with
the Attorney General was requested to resolve the issues.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett
RE: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

why files should not be made available were informally
provided him and are outlined in this memorandum. On
7/27/78, Mr. Keuch stated our arguments are persuasive,

but he still believed the decision in his letter of 7/24/78
was the best course of action in this matter. However,

he desired to use our arguments in responding to
Congressman Stokes' letter and asked this information be
furnished him on a formal basis. Mr. Keuch has determined
that our action in this matter will have no bearing on the
Socialist Workers Party litigation in New York. The
Congressional Inquiry Unit (CIU) believes that since copies
of these files will be excised to prevent compromise of
informants' identities, we should agree with Mr. Keuch's
position and make files available.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That we follow the decision of Mr. Keuch in

making excised copies of these informant files available to
the HSCA's Chief Counsel and Director only.

2. If the above is approved, an appropriate
communication be prepared directing to Mr. Keuch information
he desires to use in his response to Congressman Stokes.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett
RE: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

DETAILS: By letter to the Attorney General dated 4/12/78,
the HSCA requested access to files on our informants

within the Invaders, a Memphis youth gang. This request

was apparently made after a review of the Invaders file at
FBIHQ which disclosed the Memphis Office had five informants
who were providing coverage of that organization. Mr. G. Robert
Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, had advised Legal
Counsel Division that the HSCA is trying to resolve whether
or not the Invaders fomented racial violence to get King to
return from Atlanta to Memphis where he was killed and to
determine if any of these informants acted as “agent
provocateurs" in starting this violence.

None of the five informants involved are currently
active. Only one informant actually became a member of the
Invaders and that was not until after King's assassination.
Memphis files on these informants total 47 sections.

By Mr. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum dated
4/27/78, it was approved to release FBIHQ files on these
informants with all informant identifying data excised. It
was hoped these files would satisfy the HSCA that informants
were not responsible for violence. This action was taken
primarily as a "compromise" to demonstrate cooperation with
the Committee. Any additional efforts by the HSCA to review
field office files of the informants or to determine informant
identities would be opposed. Access to FBIHQ informant files 1
was limited to Mr. Blakey, since some staff members were
familiar with substantive file on the Invaders and to allow
staff access could jeopardize informants' identities.

As reported in Mr. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum
dated 5/19/78, Mr. Blakey reviewed excised copies of all
five FBIHQ informant files on 5/17/78, in the presence of
two Agents of the CIU. Following a review, Mr. Blakey stated
he found no evidence that any of our informants acted as
"agent provocateurs." He furnished FBIHQ 15 pages of notes
which he took during review and desired these notes be kept
at FBIHQ for possible later use in constructing a paragraph
in the final HSCA report to the effect that he found no
evidence that any of these informants instigated violence.
Following this review, Mr. Blakey made no verbal request that
field office files of these informants would be needed.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett
RE: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

By letter to the Attorney General dated 5/23/78,
Mr. Blakey requested access to Memphis Field Office files of
these same five informants. This letter stated that the
procedure used for review of FBIHQ files was unacceptable and
contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, but could be
utilized again.

In response to this request, a letter from the Director
to Congressman Louis B. Stokes, Chairman, HSCA, dated 6/13/78,
was sent denying access to these files. A copy of this
letter and the letter transmitting it to the Department of
Justice are attached to this memorandum. Our denial was based
primarily on the overall detrimental effect this access could
have on our informant development program and, as this letter
pointed out, the lives and safety of our informants could
be placed in jeopardy. This letter also stated that our
decision to make the FBIHQ informant files available was not
meant to serve as a precedent for the HSCA to request field
office files for the same informants. Mr. Robert L. Keuch,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General, concurred with our position
in the absence of additional information from the HSCA bearing
on the allegation that our informants acted as “agent
provocateurs" in instigating the violence in Memphis.

On 7/11/78, representatives of the CIU and Legal
Counsel Division met with Mr. Keuch, at which time Mr. Keuch
furnished a copy of a letter from Congressman Stokes to the
Attorney General dated 7/5/78. A copy of this letter is
attached to this memorandum. This letter sets out in detail
the basis on which the HSCA feels it has for requesting access
to informant field office files. This letter appealed to the
Attorney General to resolve the matter of the informant files
and requested a meeting with the Attorney General to discuss
the issues involved. Mr. Keuch advised that the HSCA was
prepared to subpoena these files. In his opinion, Mr. Keuch
believed the Department would lose a court decision over
the files and it would be in the Bureau's best interest
to comply with the HSCA request of 5/23/78 and allow access.
Mr. Keuch believed the letter from Congressman Stokes
contained additional information bearing on the allegation
against the Bureau in that the Committee's own investigation

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett
RE: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

had established a need to review the field office informant
files and the request was not based on irresponsible allegations.
Mr. Keuch requested that the FBI reexamine its position and
advise if the files could be made available to Mr. Blakey

only.

On 7/13/78, Mr. Keuch advised that if files were
not forthcoming, the HSCA planned to issue a subpoena for
them, an action to commence 7/17/78. .

At a meeting with representatives of the CIU,
Mr. Bassett and Mr. Bailey on 7/13/78, Mr. McDermott
directed that all five informants be contacted to determine
if they have any objections to their identities being disclosed
to the HSCA. If any did not object, then a signed waiver
would be obtained authorizing release of their files to the
HSCA. Subsequent to the meeting, Mr. Keuch was telephonically
advised of this action.

On 7/17/78 and 7/18/78, the field advised that
all five informants had been contacted and refused to allow
their identities to be disclosed to the HSCA. On 7/18/78,
Mr. Keuch was telephonically advised that all five informants
objected to their identities being disclosed to the HSCA.

By letter to the Director dated 7/24/78 (copy attached),
Mr. Keuch outlined the basis which he, as Special Counsel to
the Attorney General, believed that excised copies of these
informant files should be made available to the HSCA. In his
opinion, Mr. Keuch believes the HSCA's legislative and
investigative needs for the files are not based on “pure
speculation and/or naked allegations"; that the Committee
will issue subpoenas for the files and if we lost a court
decision regarding subpoenas, access would be broadened
and informants' identities could be disclosed; the nature of
the Committee is "that the Bureau and Department of Justice
are targets or subjects ef the investigation" and we are
obligated to be as cooperative as possible; and, that “if
and when we reach the ultimate confrontation over the possible
disclosure of informants" our position will be strengthened
by taking cooperative steps consistent with our needs to
protect informants' identities.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett
RE: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

Subsequent to receipt of this letter, Mr. Keuch
was informally furnished by the CIU a list of points against
making these files available to the HSCA. These points
were derived as results of discussions by interested
divisions at FBIHQ and a review of Congressman Stokes'
letter to the Attorney General dated 7/5/78. While it was
believed Mr. Keuch's position in this matter is sound, we
also desired he be made aware of our arguments in opposition
to making these informant files available. These points

_given to Mr. Keuch informally are as follows:

1. As stated in our letter to Congressman Stokes
dated 6/13/78, if it becomes general knowledge that FBI
informant files are being opened to outside parties, informant
privilege is threatened and our informant development
program can be severely hampered. Despite the HSCA's statement
in the letter from Congressman Stokes that it is not seeking
the informants' identities at this time, this is not the
central issue in point. The central issue is the principle
of opening a field office informant file to outside parties.

nana

2. The HSCA was provided access to_FBIHQ files
concerning informants who reported on the Invaders. —
Although the HSCA feels these were administrative in
nature, the policy of the Bureau at that time required that
all information of a substantive nature be furnished to FBIHQ.
Data such as informant's travel, amount of payments and a
summary of background material are examples of such infor-
mation provided to FBIHQ. Therefore, FBIHQ feels that its
files contain significant information concerning the operation
of any informant.

a

3. All information of substance concerning the
Invaders organization furnished by these informants would be
reported in the Invaders file at FBIHQ. The HSCA has had
access to this file since December, 1977. The HSCA has. Pa
shown no interest in reviewing the Memphis Field Office
file concerning the Invaders, a file which would contain
all reports from informants covering the Invaders. It
would appear logical to examine this file in detail prior
to pressing for files of informants, none of whom were
even members of the Invaders at the time of or prior to
King's assassination.

4. Review of FBIHQ informant files was restricted
to Mr. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA,
and not to his staff because, since the staff had access
to the Invaders file at FBIHQ, their knowledge of the
organization could possibly result in identification of
informants through a cross checking of the files. Subsequent
to Mr. Blakey's review of the informant files, the FBIHQ
Invaders file was delivered to the HSCA on 7/6/78. Now
Mr. Blakey himself has access to the substantive Invaders
file, and similarly, his possible new knowledge could result
in source identification if allowed access to field office
| files.

5. On 7/17/78 and 7/18/78, all five informants
were contacted to determine if they would permit disclosure
| of their identification to the HSCA. All declined.

6. Following his review of FBIHQ files on
5/19/78, Mr. Blakey told agents present that he found
no evidence that any of our informants acted as "agent
provocateurs." He furnished notes taken during his review
to FBIHQ and requested the notes be maintained by the FBI
for possible future use in writing into his final report a
paragraph to the effect he had found no evidence that any of
these informants had instigated violence. He made no request
at that time to review field office informant files. It is
possible that Mr. Blakey is satisfied with the review of
FBIHQ informant files.

7. The FBI desires to maintain consistency
with regard to our position in this matter. In our letter
to Congressman Stokes dated 6/13/78, access to these
files was denied. This position was decided upon after
careful deliberation between interested divisions in the
FBI and in our view the HSCA has provided no basis to cause
a change of this position.

8. Providing the HSCA access to field office
informant files, although excised, could serve as an
undesirable precedent for other outside groups to review
such files.

9. Because of the large number of excisions

in these files to protect the identities of informants,

it is unlikely the HSCA will be satisfied with its review,
if granted. It will probably ask for fewer excisions and/
or the identities of the informants.

RE: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

10. Finally, the letter from Congressman
Stokes dated 7/5/78, has been analyzed at FBIHQ and,
_generally, it is not believed it contains additional infor-
mation giving substance to the allegation that our informants
acted as "agent provocateurs." Specifically, the following
points are noted:

a. The letter states (pages 1 and 4) that the
HSCA had access to relevant Bureau personnel and has
conducted extensive interview among those who may also
be subjects of this aspect of the Committee's investigation.
The Committee claims need to review the files to determine if
the written record supports or refutes the oral testimony
on the relevant questions. However, the letter offers
no specific results of interviews of personnel or
others concerning the basic allegation. It has not identified
any specific individual who has furnished information
bearing on this allegation.

b. The letter states (page 4) that based on
field interviews with former members of the Invaders and
people present in Memphis at the time of the march, the
"Invaders were in fact a proximate cause of the violence."
This is not new information. The FBIHQ file concerning the
Invaders, media reports issued then and more recently verifies
the Invaders culpability regarding violence during the march.
The letter also states (page 4) that "it is universally
believed that the Invader followers who caused the violence
were paid FBI operatives." The FBI considers this statement
a sweeping generalization and again the Committee offers
no specific identities of individuals who believed those
causing violence were FBI informants. Other than articles
appearing in "Newsday" magazine in 1976 and more recently
statements by Mark Lane and possibly former members of the
Invaders, who else shares this belief? The letter from
Congressman Stokes identifies no one.

c. This letter states (page 4) that the "Memphis
Field Office had prior knowledge of impending violence (a
fact memorialized in FBI documents)." This statement
implies the FBI knew of violence because its informants

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

were instructed to instigate violence. However, as shown
in our files, FBI knowledge of impending violence was based
on information from various informants and officials,
resulting from a tense situation brought about by the
Sanitation Workers Strike, all of which made knowledge of
impending violence rather obvious.

d. The letter states (pages 4 and 5) that "members
of the Invaders were observed by agents of the FBI exhorting
the crowd and readying weapons from signposts (a fact later
testified to under oath by these agents)." A review of the
Invaders and informant files at FBIHQ disclosed that none
of the informants were members of the Invaders at the time
violence occurred. . Only one of these five informants was
ever a member and that was subsequent to the assassination.

e. The letter states (page 5) that "Professor
Blakey's review of the files revealed that at least one
informant subsequently joined a more violence-prone
organization." It is assumed this statement is to demonstrate
the informant's propensity for violence. However, the FBI
believes that King's death and the rioting that followed
intensified racial feeling and tended to make some organiza-
tions more violent. Therefore, it is logical that whatever
organization our informant was redirected into, it would be
more violence prone.

On 7/27/78, Mr. Keuch telephonically advised a
representative of the CIU that he reviewed our arguments
and found them persuasive, but still he believed the decision
as outlined in his letter of 7/24/78 was the best course
of action in this matter. He stated, however, that he
desired to use our arguments in responding to the letter
from Congressman Stokes and asked that this information be
furnished him on a formal basis. Mr. Keuch also stated
he had contacted the United States Attorney in New York
handling the Socialist Workers Party case and had received
clearance that our action in this matter would have no
bearing on that litigation.

. s ‘The allegation that cur infermants instigated vielence is ast

a @ tow ene. As disclosed in the FBI's file en the Iavaders, this allegetion
was reported in the media in February, 1976. At that time, files of
FBIUQ aad the Menphis Office ef the FRI were reviewed concerning the
allegation with negative results. The Memphis Office aévised thet these
inferments 41d net edvocate nor take part in the plenaing of any riot.
This itty ma was furnished te the Attorney Coneral by letter dated
March 4, .

Turther, the Department ef Justice Task Yorce reviewing the
¥EI's assassination and security investigations ef King eoncluded there
was mo evidence that the activities of these informants related te King
er were in any way connected with his sssessisation.

Despite the evervhelaing evidence disproving the above allegs-
Sion, this Bureau, in an effert to cooperate with the HSCA as fully as
possible and efter very careful deliberation, decided to make the YEIEQ
fnforment files available enly te Mr. Blakey with all inferueat identifying

@erve as @ precedent for the HSCA to request the field effice files on
the sane infernente wor for that matter te make available the files ef

fact, the purpose in reviewing these files is to determine whether these
infornents acted es “agent provocateurs,” this Bureau fe more then
willing to furaish a eworn affidevit denying this allegatica.

In referenced letter, Mr. Blakey stated the procedure by which
be was peraitted aceese to F512 infornant files was wnecceptable. It
should be soted thet Mr. Blakey agrees to these conditions, but prior te
the review, requested that menbers of his staff aleo be given access te

tities.

As you ean fully understand, the issue of pernitting eutside
parties to review informant files of the FBI is a very delicate one. It
fe vital to protect eur confidential informants because we miy be dealing
with the Lives and sefety ef these informants and meabers of their

NOTE: By Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum dated 4-27-78, it was approved

to allow Blakey access to files of informants who furnished information
concerning the Invaders. This action was taken in hope of satisfying

the HSCA that our informants were not responsible for violence which
occurred during the Sanitation Workers Strike in Memphis. After Mr. Blakey
revieved these files, as reported in Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum

dated 5-19~78, Blakey stated he found no evidence that any of our informants
acted as “agent provocateurs.” However, he followed with an additional
Fequest to see the informants’ Field Office files.

Representatives of the Congressional Inquiry Unit, the Legal
Counsel Division, and the Top Echelon end Criminal Informant Unit,
Criminal Investigative Division, are in total agreement that we should

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

duly 5, 1978

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell
Attorney General of the United States
Department of Justice

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the Committee's investigation into

“ the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King, dr., I write to request that you make certain field
office informant files available to the Committee so that
serious aitegations involving the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation and the death of Dr. King may be resolved, The
Committee has already had access to the relevant Bureau

: personnel, and it has conducted extensive interviews among

| those who may also be subjects of this aspect of the Com-

| mittee's investigation. The focus of the Committee's

effort now is to determine if the written record supports

or refutes the oral testimony on the relevant questions.

These files have been denied to the Committee by the Director

of the Bureau by letter dated June 11, 1978, with the con-

currence of the Criminal Division. I write this letter to

ask that you give your personal attention to resolving this

serious matter,

On October 7, 1977, you and I signed the Memorandum
of Understanding between the Department and the Select Com-
mittee. As you will recall, it was intended that the.
Memorandum should cover what materials the Department of
Justice would release to the Committee, (I.A.C.).

In a letter dated April 12, 1978, Professor G. Robert
Blakey, the Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Com-
mittee, confirmed an oral request in which he asked’ Sr
“the informant files on all informants in the Invaders
(a Black militant group in Memphis, Tennessee) during 1968
and provide the Committee with access to these files."
(See II. B.) Apparently, this group was involved in the
violence that occurred in Memphis when Dr. King was there

: in 1968. The files were to be examined in a form in which +
Pas only the identity of the informants had been exercised from
jon them. The letter also expressly noted the "Committee ...

-_ reserves the right to request...the identity of all Invader
informants during 1968 should the sanitized files and agent
interviews be inconclusive on the issues to be resolved by
the Committee." (See I.B.(1))

.

During the week of May 14, 1978, the Bureau, in partial
response to the April 12th request, permitted only Professor
Blakey to review the duly excised FBI Headquarters informant
files. The staff of the Committee was denied access to the
files. Professor Blakey agreed to this form of limited access,
reserving the right to insist that the terms of the Memorandum
of Understanding be complied with.

In a letter dated May 23, 1978, the Committee then
requested "that the Memphis Field Office files for these
Hi same informants be prepared for access by the staff." The
Headquarters files contained basically administrative data;
a it was felt that the Field Office file might be more en-
a lightening. The letter also observed, "While the Committee
feels that the procedure by which... (Professor Blakey) was
permitted access to the first set of files was unacceptable
and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending
, further discussions to arrange to broaden access, this pro-
cedure may again be utilized.”

It should be clearly understood that the Committee's
request for these files, as well as the other informant
files, is predicated on the precise language of the Memo-
“ randum of Understanding.

: Section I.B.(2) of the Memorandum sets out the
"Specific Rules" by which access to materials may be ob-
tained. Section I.B.(2), in pertinent part, provides:

: i Where...requested materials reveal the
identity of FBI sources who are or were
informants...The D(epartment) of J(ustice)
will appropriately sanitize, including ex-
cising, if necessary, information identifyin
such operat ronse sources or informants. emphasis

Under I.B.(2), the only matter at issue is the terms
of access. Denial of access is not contemplated. B(2) a
clearly allows access to the files at issue, subject only
to proper sanitization. Nothing else is asked for here.

The Committee is fully cognizant of the issues raised
by the Bureau in its letter of June 13, 1978, in response
to our request. It is, of course, recognized that a measure
of confidence in the Bureau's informant program would, in
fact, be eroded should it become general knowledge that
the FBI identified its informants in anything but extra-
ordinary circumstances, where, under the prevailing view,
they must be identified. See Roviaro v. United States,
353 U.S. 53 (1957). Nevertheless, all this is premature;
the Committee has not requested, as yet, that the identity
of these informants be revealed. All that is requested is
access to the files, in order that serious allegations
involving the informants and the Bureau be resolved.

The Director's letter of June 13, 1978, offers instead
of access to the relevant files, sworn affadavits denying
the Bureau's informants acted as "agents provacateurs”". The
Committee feels that this procedure for resolving this issue
would be unacceptable. As you know, with respect to the King
investigation the Committee is, in effect, performing for
death of Dr. King the same function that the Warren Commission
performed for the death of President Kennedy. One of the most
frequent criticisms of the Warren Commission is that in at-
tempting to resolve the issue of whether or not Lee Harvey
Oswald was an FBI informant, the Commission accepted sworn
affadavits from the Bureau. The Committee feels, therefore,
that it is unacceptable in this instance merely to rely on
sworn denials without an opportunity to examine and cross
examine the relevant witnesses and to examine primary source
documents. Our investigation must command the confidence of
the American people if it is to achieve its goals. Conse-
quently, it will not be possible for the Committee to accept,
as the Director suggests, that this issue be resolved by the
taking of affadavits from the Bureau.

After noting that the allegation that the Bureau or
persons employed by it instigated violence is not new, the
Director's letter of June 13, 1978, denied the Committee
access to the files, referring to "overwhelming evidence
disproving the...allegation." In support of that assertion,
the Committee is told that "The Memphis Office advised that
these informants did not advocate nor take part in the
Planning of any riot." Next, our attention is drawn to the
Department of Justice Task Force's conclusion, stated in two
sentences of their report.



ee e acca ae’

7 "There is no evidence that the activities :
|. of these informants related directly to
. Dr. King. Moreover, there is no evidence
that would suggest that these informants
were connected in any way to the assassina-
tion of Dr. King. (HQ 134-11867; 170-1841;
170-1922; 170-2530, and 157-4885) ."

From the Committee's perspective, this "evidence" is
‘ hardly overwhelming. But that is largely beside the point.

i Without access to this evidence, it cannot be evaluated.
Mere denials and conclusions cannot be accepted in lieu of
records and sworn testimony. The Committee has completed
the compilation of an oral record of the events that tran-

EEE spired in Memphis during March and April, 1968. This record

. consists of interview notes, testimony under oath before the
Committee, and witness depositions. It is now imperative
that these witnesses' current recollections be compared with

I the contemporaneous written record, particularly that con-

tained in the relevant informant files.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the Com-

: mittee has attempted to move with restraint. It was not until

. our field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

: people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968
March revealed: 1) that the Invaders were in fact a proximate
cause of the violence, and 2) that it is universally believed

h that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives that we requested access to any informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation
Strike, Invaders, King and Southern Charter Leadership Con-
ference files. It had also reviewed the Memphis Police
Department files, and it had interviewed their undercover
. Operative within the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers it
A yw sought would be contained in the Headquarters files. They
Hee Ly. are, as noted above, largely administrative, containing only
: general information on informant reliability, payment of fees,
Seo and justification for continuing the informant's status. They
es do not contain agent instructions; they do not reflect in
detail the working relationship between agents and informants.
From the Committee's perspective, therefore, the information
contained in the Headquarter files proved inadequate. Sub-
7 sequent interviews with current and former agents have also
be revealed that: 1) the Memphis Field Office had prior know-
. ledge of impending violence (a fact memorialized in FBI
documents) and 2) members of the Invaders were observed by

agents of the FBI exhorting the crowd and readying weapons +
. from signposts (a fact later testified to under oath by
“these agents.) Professor Blakey's review of the files
: revealed that at least one informant subsequently joined
ides a more violence-prone organization. You can see, therefore,
: the -peenitied why access to the files, duly excised, is es-
sential.

: I feel that this is a matter that can best be resolved
of by our discussing the issues involved. Since the Select

: Committee's investigation is in its last stage -- our public
‘ hearings will begin in August -- I suggest that you give me
7 a call this week and we can meet as soon as possible to dis-
cuss this matter.

SUBJECT: “ “House Select Committee on Assassinations
Request for Memphis Field office Files

By letter dated July 5,.1978, directed to the Attorney
General, the Select Committee has repeated its request for
access to the Memphis, Tennessee, field office informant files
concerning informants in the Invaders, a black militant group
in that city. It is my judgment, ‘as Special Counsel for the
Attorney General, that it is necessary to provide access to
excised versions of the requested files to Committee Chief
Counsel, Professor G. Robert Blakey. I have made an oral
request to have the files processed and this is to request
that this task be completed as soon as possible and that
Professor Blakey be provided access to the processed files.

As you are aware, we had, by letter of June 13, 1978,
previously refused the request of the Committee. I concurred
in that action and believe it was correct based on the fact
that, in our view, the only need demonstrated by the Committee
for access to the field office files rested on naked allega-
tions which had been denied in the past. In the Committee's
latest demand, presented by the July 5 letter, the Committee,
on pages 3, 4, and 5 of the letter, outlines in greater detail
the justification for its request. While it may be our judg-
ment that the information set forth by the Committee is not
sufficient to substantiate the allegations made about the
activities of the informants at issue, it is equally clear
that we can no longer take the position that the Committee's
legislative and investigative needs are based on pure specula~
tion and/or naked allegations. That being the case, the
limited access outlined above should be granted in response
to the Committee's request.

I am, of course, aware Of the deep concern held by the
Bureau concerning any indication that we are willing to
disclose informants or release information which will lead
to their disclosure. I share that concern and my decision
in this matter has been reached only with the greatest
possible consideration of that concern.

It is regrettable but inescapable that the timing of ..-.. ...
this demand by the Committee makes our decisions much more =
subject to public comment and criticism. The present interest
in, and repeated stories related to, the allegations in the .
‘case of Mr. Rowe makes this one of the worst times to come :
to-.a.point of absolute refusal in the face of the justifica-. ..:
tions advanced by the Committee. If and when we reach the
ultimate confrontation over the possible disclosure of
informants, our position will be extremely strengthened by
any steps we can take consistent with our needs to protect
our informants to provide the Committee with necessary
evidence and information. ‘That balance, at least at this
stage, is best struck by offering the limited access under
discussion.

Since the Committee's last request was directed personally
to the Attorney General by the Chairman of the Committee, the
Committee is preparing for public heatings in the near future,
and has delayed issuing subpoenas for these materials based on
my representations that we were making immediate efforts to
respond, we should not delay our response to the Committee.
Therefore, I am sending a copy of this request to the Attorney
General. If the Bureau disagrees with my determination and
decides not to comply ,with my decision, your response should
be directed to the Attorney General so this matter can be resolved
quickly.

_ In addition to the further justification submitted ‘by

the Committee for their request, I believe there are other ~“" ___
- factors which support my conclusion that we should provide | iH

the limited access discussed. An important factor is that,

if the response to the Committee's latest request is a complete

refusal, the Committee will issue subpoenas for the informant

files. The only way we could respond to such subpoenas other

than by providing the requested information would be to seek

to have them enjoined by a federal court. While this type

of confrontation may ultimately be necessary during the course

of the Committee's proceedings, it does not appear wise to

take this step without first offering limited access. This

is so for two reasons.

First, in contrast to the limited access we will offer
the Committee, a subpoena would request access to the informant
files by the entire staff thereby increasing the possibility
that the informants could be compromised through the knowledge
of the members of the staff who have studied the other files
in the matter in greater detail and, in any case, would broaden |
the number of individuals who could learn the identity of the
informants.

Secondly, if we are to prevail in the litigation, a 7
possibility which, in my judgment, is remote given the. subject
matter of the Committee's inquiry and the allegations and
information that formed the basis of their request, we can
only win if we show a reasonable posture to the court. An
absolute refusal to comply would not do that. An attempt
to meet the Committee's needs while protecting our interests
by providing limited access to excised files would do that.

Further support for the procedure of providing limited
access stems from the very nature of the Committee's investi-
gation. Unlike the normal Congressional investigation and/or
lawsuit, the Bureau and the Department of Justice are targets
or subjects of the investigation. Under such circumstances
our obligation to be as cooperative as reasonably possible
with the Congress is obvious. The public conception of our
cooperation is going to be a very important factor in the
acceptance or lack of acceptance of the Committee's efforts
and determinations in these investigations. To put ourselves
in a posture of confrontation with the Committee over this
particular issue without first attempting some accommodation |

of competing interests would only serve to revive all the
allegations and criticisms of us and our actions concerning
the assassinations.

PURPOSE: To provide results of interviews of former

concerning information regarding the Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., assassination case (MURKIN) recently discovered in a
St. Louis informant file.

SYNOPSIS AND DETAILS: In Ryan to Bassett memorandum dated
7727778, background information was provided regarding the
recent discovery of information in St. Louis file 137-16185
concerning the existence of a possible conspiracy in the -
MURKIN case, which, apparently, had never been acted on or (-;
disseminated. This information, contained in a meniorandum /‘/

of SA Howard C. Kennedy, dated 3/19/74, set forth the details—~

of a meeting between a St. Louis informant (SL 3167-C) and

Russell George Beyers, a St. Louis fence, in the Fall of

1973, During that meeting, Beyers advised that he had met

with a St. Louis attorney and another individual, and they

had offered him $10,000 or $20,000 to kill Dr. King. Beyers C
also stated that the unidentified individual was the person .
who later paid off James Earl Ray for the assassination of

Dr. King.

On 7/28/78, the Director indicated that the two
former Special Agents from the St. Louis Office wha handled

interviews and furnish the results in FD-302 form. By
airtel to the Bureau 7/31/78, St. Louis furnished the
FD-302's reflecting the interviews of SAs Kennedy and
Bender, which had been conducted by SAC Roy B. Klager, Jr.,
on 7/28/78. Copies of the FD-302's reflecting those
interviews are attached,

In his interview, former SA Kennedy advised that he
had handled St. Louis informant 3167-C. He was shown a
memorandum dated 3/19/74, to SAC, St. Louis, from him, reflecting
several contacts with that informant. The informant furnished
information on several matters, including the information
which pertained to the MURKIN case. Kennedy recalled
receiving that information, but he hed no recollection of ever
having disseminated it. He stated that his failure to
do so was through inadvertence and, in retrospect, that
information should have been handled further. He advised
that his evaluation of the informant and the individual from
whom the information was obtained, Russell George Byers, did
not @ffeet the manner in which this matter was handled.

Robert L. Bender, former St. Louis supervisor,
advised that he had supervised the squad to which Kennedy
was assigned. He did not specifically recall the memorandum
of 3/19/74 or the information regarding the MURKIN investigation
found on Page 3 therein. He stated that because his hand-
writing appeared on that memorandum, it had crossed his desk
on or about 3/19/74, but he could furnish no reason other
than inadvertence as to why it had not been acted on or
disseminated.

On 8/2/78, the results of the interviews of former
SAs Kennedy and Bender were orally furnished to Special
Counsel to the Attorney General Robert L. Keuch, as Mr. Keuch
provides liaison between the Department of Justice and
the HSCA. Mr. Keuch and the Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility had been notified of the information
furnished by the St. Louis Office when it was disseminated
to the HSCA on 3/24/78.

Dote of tronscription 2/32/78

Mr. HOWARD C. KENWEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drive,
Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residdénce telephone number (314)
521-8221.

Mr. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private
investigator and polygraph examiner. He retired from FBI service
on 2/28/77, Prior to his retirement he was assigned to the
St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954 to the date of his
retirement. During 1974 he was assigned to general criminal
matters and worked as a Special Agent under the supervision of
Field Supervisor ROBERT L. BENDER.

Mr. KENNEDY was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office,
at which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. KENNEDY was exhibited sufficient portions of a Glosed
St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to identify it as a matter
which was at one time assigned to him while he was an FBI Agent.

The file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. O'HARA,
a former informant of the St. Louis Division of the FBI, The
attention of Mr. KENNEDY was directed to a memorandum in this
file dated 3/19/74 from him to the SAC, St. Louis. This memorandum
is identified as serial 5 of the file. He was permitted to read
this memorandum in order to refresh his memory concerning its
contents. KENNEDY related that from his review of this memorandum
it reflects the r=sults of a contact by him with O'HARA at which
time O'HARA furnifned him several pieces of information.
KENNEDY's attention was further directed to paragraph 2, page 3
of the memorandum, which paragraph begins "During the fall of
1973 ...," and ending with "... $20,000 to kill KING.”

ReFrcrognue

Mr. KENNEDY stated that upon having his memory refreshed
by reading the above memorandum, he vaguely recalls receiving
the information. He has no recollection, however, of having
disseminated the information contained in the above-cited
paragraph or that the information was otherwise acted upon.
He can cite no reason for such failure other than inadvertence.
To the best of his recollection, no action was, in fact, taken
concerning the information about MARTIN LUTHER KING, as contained

in the memorandum, and he shared this information with no
other personnel in the office.

Mr. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the
information and he is sure that no other information concerning
KING was furnished to him by O'HARA. He can make no comment
with regard to the credibility of the information at this late
date. He does not believe, however, that credibility of either
O'HARA or BYERS entered into any decision or lack of decision
with regard to dissemination of the information concerning KI'iG.

KENNEDY recalls, however, from his many years of service
in the FBI at St. Louis that RUSSELL BYERS was a well-known
fence.

KENNEDY reiterated that he has no idea or reason for the
failure to disseminate the information contained in paragraph
2 of page 3 of the cited memorandum as it relates to MARTIN
LUTHER KING. He noted that there is nothing written on the
memorandum to indicate such dissemination was made or action
taken otherwise.

Mr. KENNEDY's attention was further directed to a hand-
written notation on the first page of the memorandum which
states, “Notify locals of info re killing." He identifies

this notation as being in the handwriting of his former Supervisor,

ROBERT L. BENDER. Upon reading the memorandum in detail, it
KENNEDY's conclusion that this handwritten notation did
| apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied
to an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities
appearing on page 2 of the memorandum.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. ‘KENNEDY stated that
in retrospect, the information concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING
in the memorandum of 3/19/74 should have been acted upon.

Mr. ROBERT L. BENDER resides at Route 1, Box 388, Chesterfield,
Missouri 63017, residence telephone number (314) 391-6518.

Mr. BENDER is presently unemployed, having retired from FBI
service on 2/28/77. Prior to his retirement he was assigned to
the St. Louis Field Division of the FBI from 1953 to the date of
his retirement. Additionally, he served in the capacity of
Field Supervisor in the St. Louis Division of the FBI for approx-
imately nine years prior to and until the date of his retirement.
he supervised general criminal matters.

Mr. BENDER was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office, at
which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. BENDER was exhibited sufficient portions of a closed
St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to identify it as a matter
which was at one time under his supervision and assigned to an
Agent under his supervision by the name of HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

The file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. O'HARA,
a former informant of the St. Louis Division of the FBI.

The attention of Mr. BENDER was directed to a memorandum in
this file dated 3/19/74 to the SAC, St. Louis, from Special Agent
HOWARD C. KENNEDY. This memorandum is identified as serial 5 of
the file. Mr. BENDER was permitted to read this memorandum in
order to refresh hig memory concerning its contents. Although

he had no independent recollection of the memorandum or its contents,

after reading it he concluded that the memorandum had crossed his
desk on or about 3/19/74, as attested to by the appearance of his
handwriting on the memorandum. BENDER's attention was further
directed to paragraph 2, page 3 of the memorandum, which paragraph
begins, "During the fall of 1973...," and ending with "... $20,000
to kill KING."

Mr. BENDER related that he had no independent recollection of
the paragraph in question; however, upon reviewing the entire
memorandum dated 3/19/74, he found no evidence that the information
contained in the above-cited paragraph was either acted upon or

He did note that there is a handwritten notation in his hand-
writing on page 1 of the memorandum which states, "Notify locais

it was BENDER's conclusion that this handwritten notation did
not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied to
an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities appearing
on page 2 of the memorandum.

Mr. BENDER stated that he has absolutely no recollection
as to why the information contained in the above-cited paragraph
on page 3 of the memorandum in question was not disseminated
or acted upon. He can only assume that such failure was through
inadvertence. He can make no judgment whatsoever concerning
the credibility of the information as a possible reason for
not acting on it. BENDER related, however, that because of
his long association with the FBI in St. Louis, he does recall
an individual by the name of RUSSELL BYERS as a well-known
thief and fence.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. BENDER stated that in
retrospect and in light of today's climate, the information
concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING in the memorandum of 3/19/74
should have been acted upon.

U, S.. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA) ‘

A review of this material by the Congressional
Inquiry Unit (CIU) reveals the material does not involve any
informants, classification or sensitive investigative methods
of operations.

The Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts (FOIPA)
Branch has advised that most of these documents were released
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) subject to
routine excisions, including identities of persons for privacy
reasons. (Attachment two contains a copy of documents as
released under FOIA). Although we are concerned with the
privacy of individuals, we cannot object to release of this
material for privacy reasons. Release of our documents to the
HSCA was an authorized means of disclosure under the Privacy
Act. In any subsequent release, privacy of individuals involved
is the responsibility of the HSCA.

Therefore, for above reasons, we should offer no
objections to release of this information, and Mr. Keuch will
be advised to this effect by CIU. He will also be advised that,
as stated in the HSCA letter, these documents, except for
Identification Division records of Ray's brothers and those
marked as Court Exhibits, were given out under FOIA. However,
routine excisions were made, and therefore the documents are not
in their entirety in the public domain.

It is the opinion of the CIU that the nature of this
material furnished by the HSCA could at best be described as
"bland". t is believed the HSCA is seeking sensationalism.
and publigity and therefore it is unlikely its hearings will be
limited %o areas covered by the attached documents. In
addition, the Department of Justice and FBI were given only
three Aays to review this material and state its objections,
if . Mr. Keuch was contacted on this point and agreed to
protést this short deadline to the HSCA. A representative
of she Legal Counsel Division (LCD) will also bring this point
to/the attention of Mr. Blakey in effort to secure more time
fgr future review of documents subject to public hearings.

This matter has been coordinated with Ron Heller,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, LCD,
H. P. Beckwith, Disclosure Section, FOIPA, and S. P. Riggin,

Walker was received at the MSP on December 20,
1977, to serve three consecutive three year sentences
from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, for Exhibiting and Flourishing
a Dangerous and Deadly Weapon, for a total of nine years
sentence. He previously had been in the MSP from October 10,
1967, until released on May 23, 1969, on a three year sentence (
for Assault With Intent to do Great Bodily Harm. He previously
had been committed to State Hospital #4 in Farmington, Missouri,
on several occasions, dating back to 1957, with final release
in May 1967. |

His history of mental disorders included alcoholism,
and Warden Wyrick furnished the following background information
from the file on Walker, which includes references to Reverend
Martin Luther King:

"HEALTH: No restrictions. Subject had several admissions
to Barnes Hospital early in 1964. A report from his doctor
concerning this indicates the subject suffers from recurrent
hematemasis which is severe enough to cause anemia. Subject
on many occasions has required numerous blood transfusions.
Information from the same report indicates that the subject
loses blood through his bowels, urine and coughing. Subject
also complains that he suffered a football injury to his
back while attending school and since that time on occasions
he suffers from blackouts and paralysis. The subject's
family physician could find nothing wrong with his back

and apparently believes his paralysis are due to hysteria.

"Subject has been admitted to Farmington hospital on several
occasions dating back to 1957. He has been discharged several
times and escaped from the hospital on two different occasions.
He was diagnosed as schizophrenic reaction, chronic
undifferentiated type. This report reveals several bizarre

eccasions in the subject's past behavior. On occasion
subject claimed that he received money from an individual

to assinate Martin Luther King. At this time he was stopped
by the Sheriff of St. Francois County from buying a bus
ticket preparatory to boarding a bus to kill King. Subject
has been on medication however, is not taking any now.

"SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT: According to the subjects mother he had
worm spasms when he was one year old and suffered with
enuresis until he was 17 years of age. School records
indicate irregular attendance and poor grades. Subject
denies any use of narcotics and claims he has drunk
excessively for the last several years. Employment wise
he claims that he has worked as a laborer, however,
cannot do hard work because of his physical disabilities,
primarily a back injury. Subject married a 14 year old
girl in 1957 and divorced her several years later. He is
now the father of six children born from his present wife.
Subject has a history of severe mental illness and twice
escaped from State Hospital No. 4. His behavior at the
hospital apparently was satisfactory. For recreation

the subject claims that he enjoys picnics, hunting and
watching television with his family.

“EVALUATION: This is a 29-year old Caucasian from Elvins,
Missouri serving his first felony incarceration. Subject
during this interview appeared to be a neat, cooperative
individual tho at this time has complete control over his
behavior. There is no evidence that the subject has ever
been arrested other than the present offense however,
he has on several occasions been placed in jail after
bizarre behavior which included threatening Martin Luther
King and on another occasion arming himself and searching
for escaped prisoners from jail. The subject's community
apparently suspect the subject in regard to an individual
who was murdered after being charged with raping a girl.
Subject has a history of blackouts, mental illiness,
repeated paralysis and internal bleeding. He is an
individual who for the last several years has received
welfare and spends most of his time in taverns. There
is information which indicate his family or wife are not
stable individuals who the subject can rely on.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Former Special Agent Harold R. Dobson (1941 ~- 1972),
residence: 8831 Bracken Circle, St. Louis, Missouri 63123,
who was St. Louis case Agent on the M. L. King - James Earl Ray
case in 1968, was interviewed, not under oath, by Mr. Michael
Eberhardt, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, at the offices of that committee,
Room 3386, Second and "D" Streets, Southwest, Washington, D. C.,
from 2:00 P.M. to 2:45 P.M. on the afternoon of June 28, 1978,
“at which time he furnished the following information in response
to direct questions: 7

Dobson served as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation from October 20, 1941 to retirement on June 20,
1972, being assigned to the Boston, Newark, St. Paul, and St.
Louis Divisions. He was in St. Louis from 1947 until retirement.
He was assigned to the Security Squad from 1948 to retirement,
concerned primarily with investigation of the Communist Party and
its members, nationalistic tendency, espionage, sabotage, and
Security of Government Employee. cases. He had comparatively
little knowledge or experience regarding New Left, racial and hate
| group cases. He was an alternate supervisor but declined
authorization as supervisor for personal reasons.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of the
Cointel Program in St. Louis, but was unable to recall any
specific activities, objectives, or accomplishments of same.

Dobson was unable to suggest why the case was assigned
to him, except that he had the first St. Louis lead in the case,
to trace the weapon used through officials of Browning Arms
Company, with whom he had continuing liaison, and for the further
reason he had been utilized in an administrative capacity on

virtually every major case of national importance in the St.
Louis Division beginning with the surveillance and apprehension
of St. Louis Communist Party leaders in 1952. Another Special
Agent since retired handled the Ray penitentiary escape case
prior to the assassination.

Special Agent in Charge Thomas Gearty supervised the
King case in St. Louis, It was Dobson's responsibility to
coordinate the investigation, handle the resulting "mountain of
paper", see that obvious, logical, reasonable, or merely
desirable leads or avenues of investigation were appropriately
assigned (with Special Agent in Charge approval), promptly and
adequately covered, and properly reported, and to keep the
Special Agent in Charge; Bureau, Memphis, and other interested
offices promptly advised of pertinent developments.

Until the true identity of Ray was established, every
Special Agent in the St. Louis Division was assigned exclusively
to the case. Twenty-four hour coverage of all leads was
mandatory. Developments of the day were discussed, and "brain
busting" sessions were held at nightly conferences of all
Special Agents, at which most new assignments were made. Ali
employees clearly gave of their best efforts. .

Dobson was unable to recall specifically what efforts
were made to determine the whereabouts of John Ray on the day |
of the assassination. He suggested the file would be the best
evidence in this regard. He believed the possibility of John
Ray's involvement was undoubtedly recognized and that appropriate
steps were taken to resolve.

Dobson was unable to recall any surreptitious. entries
to Ray's relatives' premises. St. Louis had no technical
surveillances on relatives. Requests for authorization for
same may have been made, but if so, were without his knowledge.

To the extent of his knowledge, the St. Louis Division
had never placed a technical surveillance on Ring.

Toll call records of relatives were obtained in
accordance with a then current Bureau policy subpoena process.
Relative bank accounts were monitored and results set forth in
reports with a statement that the information would only be
available after issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. Coverage of
relatives consisted of this, plus personal interviews and contacts

with informants, sources, neighbors, and associates, and
available public records.

Relatives were initially uncooperative in varying
degrees, but subsequently became generally cooperative,
although Dobson never fully trusted any of them. He was unable
to recall any evidence developed that Ray was ever in St. Louis
territory, or in contact with any relatives there, subsequent to
his penitentiary escape. He doubted financial contributions to
Ray by them, as their combined incomes and assets, in his
estimation, were insufficient to support the life style Ray
apparently enjoyed following his escape.

Dobson had no knowledge or any information as to the
source of Ray's income following his escape. Hé conjectured
the same would have logically had to result from successful
criminal activity or be contributed by an unknown person or.
group. He recognized Ray's record stamped him as a "loser",
but opined it was not beyond the realm of possibility access
to an excellent prison library and association with convicts
less unsuccessful than himself could have enhanced the quality
of Ray's thought processes to a point where he could have
conceived and carried out a successful supermarket or other
similar robbery. At least his escape was successful. He
considered Ray's technically proper preparation and filing of a
motion for a new trial, which was pending at the time of his
escape, as evidence of this possibility. Dobson recalled that,
as a Missouri prosecutor prior to entering the Bureau, he had
uniformly recommended alternative punishment for non-habitual
eriminals, as the Missouri Penitentiary, even then, was generally
considered a "finishing school for criminals". Supermarkets
offered the possibility of being almost as lucrative as banks,
without the disadvantage of incurring Federal jurisdiction. He
feels sure major police departments in the St. Louis territory
had been contacted to determine if Ray could be a logical
suspect in unsolved supermarket robberies. He recalled some
indication Ray might have been involved in a bank robbery in
Alton, Illinois and that the Springfield, Illinois Division had
been so advised, but he had no knowledge as to the outcome of
investigation there.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of white
hate organizations, but was of the opinion members of such
organizations in St. Louis territory lack sufficient organization,

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE CN ASSASSINATIONS

intelligence, and financial capability for significant
involvement in the King killing. Such organizations, in his
estimation, should have been able to reasonably foresee
King's death would elevate him to the status of a martyr,
which would have been counterproductive to their aims and
purposes. He was of the further opinion that any intelligent
co-conspirator would undoubtedly have eliminatedRay as a
security measure. He suggested that, if then current rumors
that King had become a liability to the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference were true, that organization had the most
to gain from King's demise.

All St. Louis informants, potential informants and
sources regarding criminal, security, racial, hate group, or
other matters, were under continuing instructions to immediately
report even the slightest information which they could obtain
or which might come to their attention regarding the King case.

Dobson recalled John Gawron as’ an elderly, self-
confessed habitual criminal, who had lived with Ray's mother
several years until her death. He never met, saw, or talked to
Gawron. If Gawron was initially carried as a PCI, but later
appeared openly, Dobson was unable to recall why, but suggested
Gawron may have initially indicated some potential for
furnishing information regarding current criminal matters and
was later found incapable of doing so. Having lived with Ray's
mother, Gawron was undoubtedly able to furnish some factual
personal history and background information as to the family
in the past, but it was Dobson's impression that Gawron was not
fully trusted by them and was capable of furnishing only
conjectural information as to their then current activities.
According to Agents handling Gawron,.he would start with a half-
truth or conjecture, and embroider upon it, and therefore was
considered generally to be unreliable.

St. Louis Agents contacting released fellow inmates
were instructed to not only obtain all possible information as
to Ray's whereabouts, but all possible information as to their
degree of association with him, his sentiments, his plans, the
identities of any associates or friends either in or out of
prison, and the manner of his escape.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS -

Dobson was unable to recall any telephonic contacts
with the Memphis case agent, although there may have been one
or two. He was in frequent telephonic contact with the.
Chicago Assistant Special Agent in Charge, who was handling
‘the case there, as Jerry Ray made at least one trip to visit.
St. Louis relatives.

Dobson never met, saw, or spoke with any Ray relatives,
with the exception of Jerry Ray who contacted him telephonically
on two or three occasions during a visit to St. Louis pursuant
to instructions from the Chicago Division.

“Dobson had no idea as to the basis for any friction

which may have existed between Director Hoover and King. Mr.
Hoover never confided in Dobson and never sought his advice.

The Bank of Alton, Alton, Illinois, was robbed! by two
white males wearing stocking masks on 7/13/67. The unknown
subjects were armed with a sawed off shotgun and an.
automatic pistol. They escaped with $27,230.00. No one was
harmed. There were no bank cameras, no bait money, and no
latent fingerprints developed. Numerous subjects, including
James Earl Ray, were developed. No one was ever identified
as the robber and the case remains unsolved. James Eugene
Gawron, known to have been an associate of Ray, advised that
he and Ray cased the Bank of Alton, in 1959, but did not rob
it as planned. Extensive investigation by the Springfield
Division, including showing of Ray's photographs, failed to
identify Ray as one of the robbers. The bulk of the Alton
investigation pertaining to Ray's involvement was reported

in the Murkin file and not the 91 file.

Dear, “Mr. | Attorney General:
BUS?

The [Select Committee_on_Assassinations_has learned that
the Department of Justice recently commenced an investigation

tion and investigating whether the circumstances relate DE
in any fashion to Dr. King's assassination in Memphis,

Therefore, in conjunction with our investigation, it is
requested that the Department of Justice, as well as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, provide the Committee with
copies of all reports, inter and intra~office memoranda, airtels,

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Captioned committee, by letter dated June 16, 1978,
requested an interview with Special Agent D. Alan Reighley, III,
Allentown,,Pennsylvania, Resident Agency, Philadelphia Division,
at a date to be later decided. The interview was subsequently
scheduled at 11:00 a.m., on July 11, 1978, at the House Office
Building, Annex 2, Second and D Streets, S.W., Washington, D. C.

On July 11, 1978, SA Reighley was interviewed by
Staff Attorney Tom Sacco, House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA), at the above address. Mr. Sacco advised he is in the
process of "tying up loose ends" in that portion of the Martin
Luther King assassination dealing with "extremist groups". All
of his questioning concerned activities of the Klan and Minutemen
groups in the Reading, Pennsylvania, area during the period of
August, 1967, through April, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated.
SA Reighley was able to give Mr. Sacco a fairly detailed account
of the general activities of these groups during the pertinent
period.

During the above interview, Mr. Sacco advised that
he is in receipt of certain "allegations" from certain sources
vegarding the relationship between the FBI and Klan and
Minutemen groups in the Philadelphia FBI territory, and, more
specifically, the Reading area. The "allegations" being that the
FBI “on a regular basis" furnished right wing extremist groups
with intelligence information for their use against Dr. King.
He stated he has specific reference to an allegation that the FBI
in the Reading area furnished extremist groups with photographs
of Dr. King in attendance at a meeting with "communists" which

House Select Committee on Assassinations

In answer to the above "allegation", SA Reighley
emphatically denied that the FBI in the Reading area had ever
engaged in such activity during his assignment there, nor
had he ever received any information that this had been done
in the FBI elsewhere.

Mr. Sacco stated that the above "allegations" came
from Roy Frankhouser (former Grand Dragon of the United Klans
of America for Pennsylvania and activitist with numerous white
hate groups including the Minuteman); and that he had also received
the same information from "other sources". He later admitted
that his investigation indicates that the information received
from “other sources" emanated from Frankhouser. Mr. Saeco then
asked numerous questions about Frankhouser and his background
and SA Reighley answered these questions in detail. He also
asked questions regarding the relationship between Frankhouser
and FBI Agents in the Philadelphia Division. He made specific
reference to retired SAs William E. Davis and Frank Kauffman,
formerly of the Reading Resident Agency; and retired Assistant
Director Joe Jameson, former Special Agent in Charge of the
Philadelphia Division. SA Reighley stated that his relationship
with Frankhouser had always been an "investigator-subject"
relationship and that to the best of his knowledge, this was the
same relationship that Davis and Kauffman had with Frankhouser.

SA Reighley also advised Mr. Sacco that he has no information at
all as to whether or not Frankhouser had any relationship
whatsoever with Special Agent in Charge Jameson but that it is
highly unlikely that Frankhouser had ever even met Mr. Jameson.

Mr. Sacco stated that SA Reighley had sufficiently
covered the area in which he is interested and he sees no
necessity to call anyone else from the FBI concerning this
particular matter. He indicated that he had certainly questioned
the reliability of the source of the allegations, namely,
Frankhouser; however, his main concern was leaving the "allegations"
unanswered. SA Reighley thanked Mr. Sacco for the opportunity
to answer the "allegations" and offered to be of any future
assistance in this regard.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS

On July 28, 1978, Michael Eberhardt, Staff
Attorney, House Select Committee on Assassinations, tele-
phonically contacted Special Agent Thomas H. Weaver of
the Jeffason City, Missouri Resident Agency, Kansas
City Division. Mr. Eberhardt was informed of Special
Agent Weaver's date of birth, home address, telephone
number and number of years assigned to the Jefferson
City, Missouri Resident Agency in response to his specific
questions.

Mr. Eberhardt's questions and Special Agent
Weaver's responses were, in summary, as follows:

Number of Agents assigned Jefferson City pre-
sently and in 1966-1968:

3 Special Agents assigned presently and 2 in
1966-1968.

Form which would have been used in 1966-1968, by
Missouri State Penitentiary, in advising FBI of an escapee
and requesting Unlawful Flight to Avoid Proseation Process:

Missouri State Penitentiary officials would have
notified Jefferson City Resident Agency of escapee and
method of escape, existence of warrant for escape and Cole
County Prosecuting Attorney would have been contacted by
Resident Agency regarding a letter requesting Unlawful
Flight to Avoid Prosecution Process through the United
States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, at
Kansas City, Missouri. It is possible in some instances,
generally in Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution cases,

that as an accommodation to a friendly prosecuting attorney
at that time, in cases of badly wanted fugitives, that
Special Agents could make inquiry before lInlawful Flight to
Avoid Prosecution process was issued to develop evidence of
interstate flight in order to give the U.S. Attorney basis
for issuance of Unlawful Fligt to Avoid Prosecution (UFAP)
process if such were not in the hands of the prosecuting
attorney, but in response to Mr. Eberhardt's question, no
specific cases were recalled.

Regarding any knowledge of any questioning of
James Earl Ray's family in UFAP case on Ray:

Normal investigative procedure would have included
interviews of Ray family members and friends and associates
of Ray in a fugitive investigation to locate him, but the
case was assigned to Special Agent Rowan B. Ayers, deceased
in November, 1974, and Special Agent Weaver is not familiar
with specific leads set out in UFAP case on Ray by Special
Agent Ayers,

Opinion of Special Agnt (SA) Weaver as to how Ray
escaped from the Missouri State Penitentiary:

SA Weaver recalls arriving at conclusion based on
- peview of Missouri State Penitentiary records that Ray
probably escaped by hiding in bread box which left His-
sourt State Penitentiary in truck, hauling bread to outside
prison farn.

SA Weaver's opinion of any outside help Ray re-
ceived in his escape:

Either through review of records or casual conver-~
sation with SA Ayers, it is SA Weaver's recollection that it
was believed at the time that Ray may have been picked up by
a car possibly operated by a family member, outside prison,
possibly after walking a distance on railroad tracks, but
SA Weaver now has no specific recollection of how this know.
ledge was mined; and in response to Mr. Eberhardt's specific
question, SA Weaver did not gain this information through in-
formant sources.

DocId:32989738 Page 70



HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Questions asial of inmates in Missouri State
Penitentiary regarding Ray's mentioning of Martin Luther
King or contract out on King:

No recollection of any questions asked in inter-
views of inmates in Missouri State Penitentiary after
Ray's identification as assassin as to Ray's ever mention-
ing Hartin Luther King or contract out to kill King, and
SA Weaver did recall that inmates were asked whether or not
Ray evidenced any racial prejudice and inmates responded in
various ways to that question, resolving nothing as SA
Weaver recalls as to his attitude in that regard.

Knowledge of narcotics in Missouri State Peni-
tentiary in the 1960's:

SA Weaver had no recollection of any narcotics
problem in Missouri State Penitentiary in the 1960's. Any
knowledge in this regard mainly developed in recent years
since SA Weaver's territory has included the Missouri State
Penitentiary.

What investigation SA Weaver conducted in investi-
gation of Ray in the UFAP case prior to his identification
as Kings assassin?

SA Weaver had no recollection of any investigation
on Ray in UFAP case prior to his identification as the
assassin of Martin Luther King.

What was the status of segregation of inmates at
the Missouri State Penitentiary as to race in the Mid-1960's:

SA Weaver had no recollection of whether or not
inmates were segregated at the Missouri State Penitentiary
in the Mid-1960's.

pee q

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

What was the frequency of FBI visits to Missouri
State Penitentiary during the course of a month in the
Mid-1960's:

SA Ayers was probably in the Hissouri State Peni-
tentiary two or three times per week in about the Nid-1960's
and SA Weaver only occasionally there during the course of
a month since his territory did not include Cole County
and the Missouri State Penitentiary in the Mid-1960's.

Whether or not FBI had any informants at Mis-
souri State Penitentiary in the Mid-1960's:

SA Weaver has no recollection of any informants
operated by SA Ayers at the Missouri State Penitentiary and
SA Weaver had none; no recollection of any Bureau policy
which would have precluded informants in the Missouri State
Penitentiary.

Any criminal investigations at Missouri State
Penitentiary other than leads to interview inmates regarding
other crimes:

Since Missouri State Penitentiary is a State
institution, the FBI had no criminal investigations there
recalled, other than occasional civil rights cases based
on complaints of inmates.

Any recollection of any civil rights complaints in-
volving James Earl Ray:

No recollection of civil rights complaints or civil
rights cases involving James Earl Ray.

In the course of a file review conducted at the

informant file-was reviewed. This file contained a contact
memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which set forth information {
relating to several criminal matters and also contained the
1 following paragraph: 7
“During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,
date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inguiring as
to whether they could get together to talk, and they later
did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, ssouri, in the area
of a Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled
on business. Beyers talked freely about himself end his
business, and they later nt to informant's house ere
-Beyers told a story abovt visiting a lawyer in St. Louis
County, now deceased, not further identified, who had
offered to give him a contract to E111 Martin Luther
He said that also present was a short, stocly man, u

valked with a limp. (Later, with regard to the- latter’
individual, Beyers commented that this man was actually

the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Ray efter
the killing.) Beyers said he had declined to accept this
contract. He did remark that this lawyer had confederate
flags and other items about the house that m iv] cate
that he was ‘a veal rebel*. Beyers also commented that

he had been offered either $10,000 or $29,900 to kill Hing.

V. 157-10673-802 p. 70 is a xeroxed copy of the
registration card for "JOE PARISH" at the Provincial Motel
as set forth on page 84 of the report of SA ALBERT E. MILLER
dated 11/27/68 at New Orleans.

The indices of the New Orleans Office contain no
other references relating to anyone by the name of "JOE PARISH."

For the information of the Bureau because "JOE PARISH"
was unable to be identified and located, it appears possible
that this is a fictitious name used by a male to rent a room
for a “l-nite stand." The name "JOE PARISH" would be used in
a similar manner as the name "JOE SMITH" is used in other
parts of the country on motel and hotel registration cards.

It is being noted that the name PARISH is commonly used in

this area as all 64 counties in the state of Louisiana are
known as or referred to as a Parish, ie. Orleans Parish,
Jefferson Parish, St. James Parish, St. John the Baptist Parish,
and so forth.

Finally, by letter dated March 23, 1978 to thSattorney

Therefore, in conjunction with our investigation, it is
requested that the Department of Justice, as well as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, provide the Committee with
copies of all reports, inter and intra-office memoranda, airtels,

. Wachtel noted that/the most important thing they would try .-

Wachtel secured plane reservations for siz’ persons.
to fly to Memphis the night of April 4, 1968: WacHtel felt that
he and his wife, Stanley Levison, Claren Jones / Harry Belafonte
and possibly Bayard Rustin would maké-the trip.” f le

Levison preferred not to have Rustin present at any
meeting they might have (in Memphis) because he,believed the
vest of the (SCLC) staff would feel hostile. ive -

Thereafter, Leyison and Wachtel began to doubt the
wisdom of going to Memptfis that night since they could not
hold any important diScussions or make any important decisions.

to do is not to h#ve violence in King's name. He indicated

that Andrew Young, Executive Vice President of the SCLC, has
taken that epproach. Levison stated this is not the kind of
approach he would have taken, that he did not mean to teil

them not to be calm or to urge them into violence, but that

he feels the point they should be making is, what kind of
system is it that produces such a thing (King's death) when

he starts to fight for.the lowly, like the garbage men. Levison
said that in other words he thought "we've got to be angry".
Levison added that Andrew Young was prdbably.thinking that there
are @ great many Negroes who are ng_to get hysterical and

go out and get themselves shot an i :

Levison subsequentYy told Harry Belafonte that he
had talked with Jesse Jacks6n, an SCLC official, who told him
not to come to Mémphis. LeVvison and Belafonte agreed to fly
to Atlanta at 11:30 AM on Friday, April 5, 1968. ‘ Levison told
Belafonte to make the reservations for the two of them and_to
let Harry Wachtel and the others worry about themselves.

: On April 5, 1968, the same source learned that
Andrew Young contacted Stanley Levison on that date. They
discussed King's successor and agreed that Ralph (Abernathy,
an SCLC official) was the only logical choice. Young stated
that they were going to call a press conference on the morning
of April 5, 1968, "To sort of straighten things out" and to
announce the establishment of the Martin Luther King Fand to
perpetuate his memory. Young noted that,Senator Robert Kennedy
had put his plane at their disposal. jive

On 4/11/68 Dr, CHARLES L, DINKINS, President,
Owen College, Memphis, and Liaison Source, orally
advised SA LAWRENCE as follows:

DINKINS went to Atlanta, Ga., to the 4/9/68
funeral of Dr, MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR,

He said JOHN BURRELL SMITH, Black Organizing
peaieee (BOP) leader, is still in school; that he is
an irresponsible loud-mouth, who is trying to legally
but unethically extort money from COME (Community on the
Move for Equality), a local group of Negro ministers
which was formed to aid the sanitation workers, under the
guise of being able to prevent racial violence in Memphis
if his group is given sufficient money,

SMITH and his group are trying to "con" the -
National Business League, headed by LEONARD SMALL, into
financing them in a project to manufacture tikis or amulets,
the African symbols which black power sympathizers wear around
their necks, SMALL will not "go for this,"

Both DINKINS and Rev. BEN HOOKS of the Middle
Baptist Church and also Judge in Shelby County Criminal Court
Division IV, are very/ciose to the National SCLC leadership,
DINKINS went to school with the current SCLC President,
RALPH D, ABERNATHY’s wife, ABERNATHY's wife used to live
with DINKINS! pay sits in ‘Selma, Alabama,
