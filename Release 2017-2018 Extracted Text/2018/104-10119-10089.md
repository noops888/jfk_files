I have discussed the point raised by you with Mr. Helms
and while we agree in principle, we believe that there is
sufficient gain from the contact and certain pieces of
information to take the calculated risk of continuing this
until 30 June, at which time she would normally be
expecting to separate herself from such responsibility in
anticipation of the expected birth of a child some time
around August 1963. I have so informed Mr. Hunt.
