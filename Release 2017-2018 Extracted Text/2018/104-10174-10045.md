The problem which seaned to need most careful consideration was

that of his cover while in Cuba,

In taliding to operational contacts he

makes there, the cover story suggested by the Station In IN 47609 of 12 Noi.:

1959 appears adeguate.' However,

according to Pan American Alrways, upon

arrival in Havana the vialtor is Issued a tourist card by the Cuban

Immigration authorities.

One must state his profession at this tire, which

should present no problem to Tichborn.

It could be that one is also asked

his reason for kieing in.Cubs.

In this case, WH has suggestod that the

answer ofuPtourist would be best since less suspicion would be placed on

Subject in the beginning.

The important aspect, however, appears to be

that of covering Tichborn as well as possible in the event that he runs

afoul of the Cuban authorities due to the naturo of his activities and hís

contacts.

I brought this matter up with Wi and they agreed that some kind

of backstopping might be a good idea.

As a result, t contacted M. Strange

Mt. Strange has agreed to provide paymont of Tichborn by a check drawn.

an the cover company to be deposited with Subjectly bank. (I guess the

final decision on

a bank deposit or cash.) If done through the cover compary and sent to

Tichborn's bank, wa should allow at least four or five days for the

deposit to be made, depending upon the speed of the postal system.
