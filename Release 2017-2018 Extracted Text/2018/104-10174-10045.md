SUBJECT: Guba TDY ~ Edvard G. Tichborn (P) -

OF.
03 1. On 12 Janusry and 13 January I talked with
of ®H Diviaion to firm up details re Tithborn's thefing here
an 15 January end xe preparations for his trip to Cuba.

2. Re the briefing, it was decided that: (1) re fan give
Subject a gonaral briefing on the Cubsn political situation (the major one
will be undertaken by the Staticn) (2), Subfect will be given sanitized
copies of the Kerlongo (?) repart Section IV, and of the report

tous. . Sons observations on security will probably also be made at this

(Me is of the opini thst since Tichborn will return to Kasningtor

i 3. The problem which seemed to need most careful consideration was
‘ that of his. cover while in Cuba, In talking to operational contacts he
i makes ‘there ,the cover story suggested by the Station, in IN-47609 of 12 Nov.
- 1959 eppeers adequate,” However, according to Pan American Airways, upon
arrival in Havana the vieltor is issued.a tourist cerd by the Cuben :
Immigration authorities. One mst state his profession at this time, vhich :
: should present no problem'to Tichborn. It could be that one is also asked
: his reason for veing in.Cuba. In this case, WH has suggested that the
fe answer .of-"tourist" vould be best since less suspicion would be placed on
Subject in the beginning. The important aspect, however, appears to be
that of covering Tichborn as well as possible in the event that he runs |
sfoul of the Cuban authorities due to the nature of his activities and his
contacts, I brought this matter up with WH and they agreed that some kind
ea of backstopping might be a good idea. As a result, I contacted Mr. Strange
ieee ef Cover Division who assured me that, if ne-essary, an eppropriate letter
could be provided Tichborn from a cover cot ouThe one finally decid

Hr. Strange suggested that if thio procedure be followed, Subject should
‘hea Le <iven tie nene.of the branch office rater then the one ia
Philadelphia, Mr,| suggested the wording of such a letter (the basic
idea of which a ar Subject to combine business with pleasure) which
I will write up (ir agreed upin by AC/PAD/¥P) in final draft, and Cover
Division will then transfer-it to the. appropriate letterhesd. Hevever, I
advised both Mr'3(fooey)and Mr.- Strange thut before going into this matter
further, I vould have to check this whole matter out with you om 14 January.

4. As far as financing is concerned, Mr. Sal WH is taking care
of this matter and as of 13 January, the te for the advance ($2,000)
has been approved, The request for one-half of Tichborn's salary, ($650)
must avait approval until Subject has'signed the anendsent to his contract
(which was received by this office on today':s date). as ner your suggestion,
Mr. Strange has agreed to-provide payment af Tichborn by @ check draxn

on the cover company to be deposited with Subject's bank. (I guess the
final decision a this vill depend oa how Subject wants the mney, whether

a bank deposit or cash.) If done through the cover compaay and sent to
Tichbornts benk, ve should allow at least four or five days for the

deposit to be made, depending upai the speed of the postal system,
