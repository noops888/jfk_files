Dear Mr. Harrelson:

Thave been asked by Jeremy Gunn to take responsibility, along with Robert Skwirot
and Michelle Combs, for handling the Review Board’s JFK Act Compliance Program
with respect to the Central Intelligence Agency.

Mr, Gunn has informed me that you have agreed to provide us with the CIA’s initial
compliance statement (as it is described in our November 27, 1996 letter to the CLA) by
the end of November 1997. Thereafter, we can establish a reasonable time for the CIA
to prepare and submit its Final Declaration of Compliance. The CIA’s Final Declaration.
will be submitted to Congress and the President.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,

“Tlontd Y. bourne
