(Unclassified - GLC) LIAISON Later in the day, I talked

with Steve Fallis, House Select Committee on Assassinations staff,

to advise him that we were not in pastion to provide access toy

files on the part of uncleared Select Committee personnel until such

time as clearances were obtained and appropriate secrecy agreements

were executed.. At this point, Richard Sprague, Counsel of the Committee,

came on the phone and referred to the fact that Mi. Knoche had made

an exception in granting access to classified material regarding the

tapes of Lee Harvey Oswald's communications with the Soviet Embassy

' in Mexico City and he wondered if similar arrangements could be

made in this case. I told Sprague I would look into it and be back in

touch with him.

5. (Unclassified - GLC) LIAISON Received a call from

Coverone peation camite taft in

"U.S. Hard Currency and Payments in 1977-1978." I made arrangements

for the document to be delivered to Ms. Fosdick this morning.
