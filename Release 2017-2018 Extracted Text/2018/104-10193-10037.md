anolo RAY and the MRP

SUBJECT: Relations with

1, For background see my memorandum of ld May 1961, teporting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. Ae will be noted in that memorandum, Manolo promised to
come up ‘with a proapectus within approaimately ten days" time, after con- Beare
sulting with bie leaders tn Cuba.

On} June 1961 Mr, Barnes called me to say that Mr, Goodwin had
been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for immediate financial
support for certain activities ofthe MRP which would run around $16, COU
dollars. Mr. Barnes asked moto contact BETANCOURT for the purpose of
ascertaining what the funds were to bo used for, exactly how miuch needed, ete,
I called BETANCOURT and he told me that | should get theses ‘details from
CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at room 549 at tha Washington Hotel.
Icailed Eugenio end made a date for me and Ray DuBola (Ray Adams is the
nang he-uses with Ray and Cisneros) to call upon him, We called on CISNEROS
at approximately 1445 hours | June, and he informed ua that he had urgent
need for pesoa for use in support of his eadorage and underground eciivilies
in Cuba, Ha said his peopte were absolutely without funds, needed money for
living expenses, transportation purchage of sabotage equipment, alc fares for
couriers, and for aesisting people to yet out of prison, Ne said that it was
now possible for people to buy thelr way out of prisoa by bribing one of the
many “coinmunist’ lawyers and judges, He thought that iv, 000 or Su, Woe
would meet tmmediate needs and that some sort of arrangement should be made
to receive funds - 3u, CO monthly or thereabouts - on a ilacd and permanent H

basis.

3. We mada no commitment to Eugenio other than to say that we would
pase hia plea along te the interested peopie. [renilnded him that we had asked
him and Manolo to prepare % plan for consideration and that we were still
walting for that plan. I said I personally doubted that anything could be done
wnul the plan was received from RAY. He said Manolo was planning to come to
Washington on the afternoon of 2 June with the plan, but that he himeelf was
having to return to Miami immediately and it was vital he be able io take the

5. RAY, upon arrival in Waskington, will Preoumably take hia plan (atong

Goodwin will pase tt down to Tracy and Tracy tous, Ray DuBoia, who has
