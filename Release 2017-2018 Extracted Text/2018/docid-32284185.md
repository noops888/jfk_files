“eoncerning their activities, some of which have no signi-
fieante to him, He pointed out that he has never exhibited
any inquisitiveness concerning these conversations because :
he felt "1t would not be healthy for him." HEGEMAN related
that within the past week he has returned from the Miami
area and while there he learned from individuals, whom he
declined to identify, but whom he claims are members of the
underworld element, that FISCHETTI and other unidentified
hoodlums are financially supporting and actively endeavoring
| %o secure the nomination for the Presidency &@: democratic
(candidate, Senator JOHN F, KENNEDY. He stated as evidence
of this fact, FRANK SINATRA is going to campaign for KENNEDY 3
|| in several of the primaries. HEGEMAN stated he has known | :
SINATRA personally since the latter has been connected with
ll motion pietures in Hollywood and he knows that SINATRA is a
hephew of JOE FISCHETTI. SINATRA is only booked to appear \
after clearance is obtained with FISCHETTI.

He advised that in addition,to SINATRA, a song
writer named JIMMY VAN HUSEN is in Miami writing campaign ‘
songs for KENNEDY. HEGEMAN advised that VAN HUSEN is SINATRA'ts
song writer and at the present time, VAN HUSEN's secretary
is rooming with an airline hostess of National Airlines
named BARBARA JEAN GALL,

HEGEMAN advised that BARBARA JEAN GALL is a native
of Miami Springs, Fla. and in the past has associated with
various hoodiums in the Miami area. HEGEMAN stated that it
is his opinion that SINATRA and VAN HUSEN are being made
available to assist Senator KENNEDY's campaign whereby

PISCHETTI and other hoodlums will have an entre to Senator
KENNEDY.

HEGEMAN advised that Senator KENNEDY's brother-in-
law, PETER LAWFORD, @ well known movie actor, has been culti-
vated by SINATRA and they are now apparently close associates.
He advised that it is Las Vegas gossip that LAWFORD has a
financial Jbnterest in the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. HEGE-
MAN claimed that the controlling interest in the Sands Hotel
is owned by DOC STATCHER, although the latter's name does
not appear as enamer, He advised that it is his understand-
ing that LAWFORD has an interest of one half of one per cent
la the hotel,

HEGEMAN stated when in Miami he had occasion to
‘ | overhear a conversation which indicated that Senator KENNEDY

had been compromised with a woman in Las Vegas, Nevada. He.
stated that he knows that Senator KENNEDY was staying at the
Sands Hotel in Las Vegas about 6 or 8 weeks ago during the
filming of a movie entitled "Ocean 11," starring DEAN MART)
He stated that he observed Senator KENNEDY in the night ¢lub
of the Sands Hotel, during this period, but has no idea as :
to the identity of any possible female companion. He stated —
that when Senator KENNEDY was in Miami, Fla., an airline
hostess named SUSAN STALLINGS, who is a native of Baltimore,
Md. was sent to visit Sen. KENNEDY. He stated that he learned
this from an airline hostess whom he did not want to involve
and whom he declined to identify. He stated that he had no
idea of the date Sen. KENNEDY was in Florida.

HEGEMAN stated that all of the above information
has come from members of the hoodlum element he has met and
thelr assockates, and he does not desire to identify them,
and in some instances does not know the identities of some
of these individuals. He stated that there is no way he can
eheck the accuracy of this information as he is afraid to ask
questions of any of these individuals, but he believes that
this information is correct. HEGEMAN said that he was con-
siderably disturbed when he learned this information, as he
would hate to see a pawn of the hoodlum element such as
SINATRA have access to the White House,

Although it is realized that the above information
as furnished by PCI HEGEMAN is to a great extent non-specific,
it is being brought to the Bureau's attention in view of the
prominence of Senator KENNEDY. HEGEMAN advised that he will
be proceeding to Mexico City within the next few days where
he will be & guest in the Bomber Hotel while negotiating with
the Mexican movie industry for distribution rights of Mexican
motion pictures in the United States. He stated his stay in
Mexico Clty will be indefinite. Upon his return, HEGEMAN
will be followed closely to assure that any additional infor-
mation received by him is made available to this office.
