INFORMATION CONCERNING

on 3/22/60, PCI JOSEPH HEGEMAN, who operates a

ouette relations business in New Orleans, La., furnished. the

following information:

HEGEMAN stated that among his clients in the public

relations

field are JERRY WALD, Hollywood motion picture

producer, and PHILLIP FRANK KASTEL, New Orleans top hoodlum.

HEGEMAN

stated that in the course of representing KASTEL

and other clients, he travels frequently to Las Vegas, Nev.,

Hollywood, and Miami, Florida. He said that in the course

of representing KASTEL's gambling interests, he has met a

number of well known hoodlums, such as MEYER LANSKY, whom

he described as a gambler operating in Miami and Havana,

cuba, and JOE FISCHETTI, Aka. JOE FISH, who HEGEMAN believes

1s the dominant figure in the racketeering element in the

Miami area.

HEGEMAN claims that as a result of his contacts

with these individuals, he has met socially a number of their

associates, whose identities are not known to him, and whom

he has not sought to identify, feeling that Inquisitiveness

on his part might be detrimental to his relationship with

KASTEL.

concerning their activities, some of which have no signi-

ficance to him. He pointed out that he has never exhibited

any Inquisitiveness concerning these conversations because

he felt "it would not be healthy for him."

HEGEMAN related

that within the past week he has returned from the Miami

area and while there he learned from individuals, whom he

declined to identify, but whom he claims are members of the

underworld element,

that FISCHETTI and other unidentified

hoodlums are financially supporting and actively endeavoring

to secure the nomination for the Presidency as democratic

candidate, Senator JOHN F. KENNEDY. He stated as evidence

lot this fact, FRANK SINATRA 1s going to campaign for KENNEDY

in several of the primaries.

HEGEMAN stated he has known

SINATRA personally since the latter has been connected with

motion pietures in Hollywood and he knows that SINATRA 1s a

nephew of JOE FISCHETTI. SINATRA is only booked to appear

after clearance is obtained with FISCHETTI.

He advised that in addition, to SINATRA, a song

writer named JIMMY VAN HUSEN is in Miami writing campaign

songs for KENNEDY.

HEGEMAN advised that VAN HUSEN 1s SINATRA's

song writer and at the present time, VAN HUSEN's secretary

1s rooming with an airline hostess of National Airlines

named BARBARA JEAN GALL.

HEGEMAN advised that BARBARA JEAN GALL 1s a native

of Miami Springs, Fla. and in the past has associated with

various hoodlums in the Miami area.

HEGEMAN stated that it

is his opinion that SINATRA and VAN HUSEN are being made

available to assist Senator KENNEDY's campaign whereby

FISCHETTI and other hoodlums will have an entre to Senator

KENNEDY.

HEGEMAN advised that Senator KENNEDY's brother-in-

PETER LAWFORD, a well known movle actor, has been culti-

vated by SINATRA and they are now apparently close assoclates.

He advised that lt is Las Vegas gossip that LAWFORD has a

financial fonterest in the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas.

HEGE-

MAN clalmed that the controlling interest in the Sands Hotel

1s owned by DOC STATCHER, although the latter's name does

not appear as anarner. He advised that it is his understand-

11ng chat LAWPORD has an interest of one half of one per cent

in che hotel.

HEGEMAN stated when In Miami he had occasion to

overhear a conversation which indicated that Senator KENNEDY

had been compromised with a woman in Las Vegas, Nevada.

stated that he knows that Senator KENNEDY was staying at the

Sands Hotel in Las Vegas about 6 or 8 weeks ago during the

filming of a movie entitled "Ocean 11," starring DEAN MARTIN.

He stated that he observed Senator KENNEDY in the night club

of the Sands Hotel, during this period, but has no idea as

to the identity of

any possible female companion. He stated

that when Senator KENNEDY was in Miami, Fla., an airline

hostess named SUSAN STALLINGS, who is a native of Baltimore,

Md, was sent to visit Sen. KENNEDY. He stated that he learned

this from an airline hostess whom he did not want to involve

and whom he declined to identify. He stated that he had no

idea of the date Sen. KENNEDY was in Florida.

HEGEMAN stated that all of the above information

has come from members of the hoodlum element he has met and

their assoctates, and he does not desire to identify them,

and in some instances does not know the identities of some

of these individuals.

He stated that there is no way he can

check the accuracy of this information as he is afrald to ask

questions of any of these individuals, but he belleves that

this information is correct.

HEGEMAN said that he was con-

siderably disturbed when he learned this information, as he

would hate to see a pawn of the hoodlum element such

SINATRA have access to the White House.

Although it is realized that the above information

as furnished by PCI HEGEMAN 1s to a great extent non-specific,

It is being brought to the Bureau's attention in vlew of the

prominence of Senator KENNEDY.

HEGEMAN advised that he will

be proceeding to Mexico City within the next few days where

he will be a guest in the Bomber Hotel while negotiating with

the Mexican movle industry for distribution rights of Mexican

Mexico City will be indefinite. Upon his return, HEGEMAN

will be followed closely to assure that any additional infor

mation received by him is made available to this office.
