INIS IS VERY IMPORTANI AND NUE A BAD JOKE!

25/11-63.

The President of the United Stütes of America, John I Kennedy was

assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the government of

the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act alore

but there was helpers and reserv. "Now all is over" was password

to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but be

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.

Later he was spy for us. When Lee E Oswald had returned fo USA we

contautEd nam dnew and Ireskeued up his minu "you have been a spy

Ior us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last information in Mexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Kennedy in lexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro lor the as-

ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion was bebind the assassin

ation. Then Cuba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend

himself. It that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-

ted. We should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. We and Sowiet should

win this war and whole the world should be Communistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjer and other soviet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEW :ORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmugaled

from our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is achinese spy-shool.

My name is Ryo Liang Yuan. Officer in the department. for State-georet.
