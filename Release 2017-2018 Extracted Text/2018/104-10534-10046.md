ATTENTION: Mr. Tom Campbell

SUBJECT: Technical Analysis of Letter and Envelope

1. Attached is a letter mailed to the American Embassy in
Stockholm purportedly from an officer in the Chinese Communist
Embassy in Stockholm. Also included is the envelope and a plain
folded sheet of paper which presumably was used to enfold the
letter within the envelope. Please perform a technical analysis
of these attachments to determine whatever can be determined
concerning the origin of the paper, envelope, typewriter, and
ink used. If you have any capability for comparing this letter
with other correspondence originating with the Chinese Communist
Embassy in Stockholm, we would like your opinion on whether or
not the stationery, typewriter, and envelope are of the type
normally used by that Embassy.

2. Because of the sensational nature of the contents of
the letter and the necessity for our checking out such allega-
tions as quickly and thoroughly as possible, it is requested
that this technical analysis be undertaken on a priority basis
and that the undersigned by notified by phone as soon as any
conclusions are reached. ©

3. Please acknowledge the receipt of the attached letter
and ensure that its whereabouts, when in your custody, is a
matter of record. We prefer that the letter and envelope be
kept as intact as possible while undergoing technical analysis.
