MEXICO CITY: BRIEF SUMMARY

LHO allegedly visited Mexico City during the latter

part of September or early October of 1963.

While there,

he supposedly was overheard in conversation by telephone

to the Soviet Embassy

from the Cuban Embassy-

We have information that indicates that the tape of

that conversation does not reflect LHO's voice.

Further,

the CIA incorrectly identified LHO as the individual photo-

graphed exiting the Russian Embassy and whose conversation

was recorded on October 1, 1963 from the Cuban Embassy•

Accordingly, an in-depth analysis of this matter must

be undertaken.

ORGANIZED CRIME

The following members of organized crime and their associates

may have pertinent knowledge concerning the circumstances surround-

ing the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

ACCARDO, TONY "BIG TUNA": ran Mafia operations in Chicago

along with Sam Giancana. Several organized crime investi-

gators feel that Accardo was

responsible for Giancana's

murder. Whether or not this is true, Accardo most likely

has much, if not all, of the

information pertinent to this

case for which Giancana was killed. He is believed alive

and in the Chicago area.

BAKER, BARNEY: was an underworld enforcer who operated out of

Chicago and who was used on occasion by the Teamsters

Union. In June, 1963, Baker was released from the state

penitentiary. Baker was allegedly an associate of Dave

Yaras and Jack Ruby. It appears that the Warren Commission's

records of Ruby's telephone calls reveals at least one call

to Baker, subsequent to Ruby having been contacted by Irwin

Weiner.

BENTON, SAM: was an underworld associate of Michael McLaney.

Reportedly, he attended

several meetings with John Roselli

at thr Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, at which the Castro

assassination plots were discussed. Benton was among those

arrested at the Lake Pontchartrain training camp, the camp

outside of New Orleans at which anti-Castro groups were

trained to conduct para-military expeditions against Cuba.

BINION, BENNY "THE COWBOY": presently owns the Horseshoe Hotel

Casino in Las Vegas, the casino in which Lewis J. McWillie

last worked. Binion is allegedly an associate of West Coast

mobsters, Jack Dragna and Mickey Cohen, as well as having

known Jack Ruby and John Roselli.

BRADING, EUGENE HALE: also known as JIM BRADEN: is believed to

be presently serving as a "personal courier" for Meyer Lansky.

Over the years he has been associated with Mafia leaders

in every national crime syndicate jurisdiction. In the fall

of 1963, Braden worked out of Room 1701 in the Pere Marquette

Building in New Orleans. Interestingly, during this same

period, David Ferrie was working for Mafia leader Carlos

Marcellos in Room 1707 of the same building. Braden was

the Kennedy

assassination by Dallas Police Officer C.L. Lewis, for

"acting

suspiciously." After being questioned for an hour

he was

released and

subsequently received attention by the Warren

---

## Page 26

- 2-

Braden, nee Eugene Hale Brading, changed his name to

Jim Braden shortly before the assassination, receiving

a new driver's license in that name on September 1o, 1963.

BROWDER, EDWARD J.: identified by an FBI informant as a gun

smuggling pilot associated with Jack Ruby, Browder had

worked for Norman Rothman on many occasions between 1958

and 1962, when he was arrested on the Mexican border and

incarcerated.

CELLINI, DINO: was an underworld associate of Lewis McWillie,

Santos Trafficante and Meyer and Jake Lansky•

CERONE, JACKIE: was a member of the Giancana-Accardo Chicago

mob. The transcript of an FBI monitored telephone conver-

sation places Cerone and Yaras in Miami in 1962 plotting

the murder of an enemy•

GRUBER, ALEX: was a scrap metal dealer in Los Angeles with a

long rap sheet, including grand larceny and detailing a

number of aliases. Gruber had been a childhood friend of

Jack Ruby. He stated to the Warren Commission that he had

had contact with Ruby only once in the ten years preceding

the assassination. However, that one time was in November

of 1963 when Gruber apparently traveled several hundred

miles out of his way to look up Ruby with whom he had not

spoken in ten years. It is also interesting that Ruby called

Gruber twenty monutes after the Kennedy assassination was

reported. Gruber is also a friend of Frank Matula, who was

an enforcer in the Southern California garbage industry and

who was appointed by Jimmy Hoffa as a trustee of the Inter-

national Teamsters Union when he was released after serving

114 days in jail for perjury.

HUMPHREYS, MURRAY "THE CAMEL": one of Frank Nitti's top aides,

Humphrey's was another of Jack Ruby's underworld associates.

JONES, PAUL: was an "advance man" for Chicago mob leaders, Sam

Giancana and Tony Accardo. His efforts to bribe members of

the Dallas Police Department in exchange for "complete pro-

tection" of certain syndicate-run Dallas operations came

to the attention of the Kefauver Commission. Jones was a

tention of the kefay

friend of Jack Ruby. Warren Commission Exhibit 1184 shows

that Ruby was introduced to Jones by Paul Labriola and Jim

Weinberg, both syndicate associates of Sam Giancana. Steve

Guthrie, who was

at the time of the bribery attempt, Sheriff

of Dallas, stated to the Warren Commission that Ruby had been

involved in the bribery attempts by the

Giancana-Accardo

group. Further testimony by Guthrie indicates that Ruby was

one of the Dallas front men for mob gambling activities.

---

## Page 27

- 3-

However, the Commission chose to find Guthrie's testimony

"hard to accept" because Lt. George Butler, a Dallas Police

Officer who was also involved in the Jones case, did not

recall Ruby being involved. Twenty-two secretly recorded

tapes of conversations between Guthrie, Butler and Jones

were reviewed for the Warren Commission by one FBI agent,

who prepared no transcript but instead, prepared a brief

report stating that Ruby's name was not mentioned. One of

the recordings, however, containing two conversations, was

missing. It might be noted that in pitting one witness against

another, the Warren Commission chose to believe the one who

had stored material evidence in a bribery conspiracy case

in his home, only to have some of that evidence turn up

missing and

who had, according to a Warren Commission Exhi-

bit, approached two other Dallas Police Officers after the

assassination with the revelation that Lee Harvey Oswald

was really the illegitimate son of Jack Ruby.

LANSKY, MEYER: is perhaps the most powerful syndicate leader

the world. He was the chief

architect of the syndicate's

gambling activities in Cuba and was subsequently the major

financial victim of Castro's expulsion of organized crime

from the island. Lansky reportedly placed a $1 million bounty

on Castro's head.

Lansky established ties between organized crime and the

intelligence community in the mid-1940's.

Whether or not Lansky was directly associated with Jack

Ruby

depends upon whether or not it can be established that

the

"Fox brothers" referred to by Ruby in testimony before

the Warren Commission were in fact, the Lansky brothers,

Meyer and Jake. Irrespective of direct participation, however,

Meyer Lansky is an important witness since both information

ard responsibility obviously stopped with him. He is currently

living in the Miami area.

MARCELLOS, CARLOS: is considered the second or third most power-

ful Mafia leader in the United States. His realm of control

is the Gulf states region; his base of operations is New

Orleans, Louisiana. The McClellan Senate Committee identified

Marcellos' New Orleans operations as the key distribution

point for heroin shipments. Marcellos, along with associates

Jimmy Hoffa and Sam Giancana, was a target of investigation

by the Justice Department under the Kennedy Administration.

Other associates of Marcellos, who were pivotal to his success,

were Meyer Lansky and Santos Trafficante.

On April 4, 1961 Marcellos was deported from the United States.

It was a highly publicized

and potentially illegal deportation.

Two months later, reportedly using David Ferrie as a pilot,

Marcellos returned from Guatemala to the

United States where

he challenged his deportation and won. His subsequent hate

of the Kennedy brothers was such that in September of 1962

---

## Page 28

- 4-

he allegedly told conferates at a secret meeting that plans

to kill both Kennedy brothers were underway.

Marcellos continued to use Ferrie's services as a pilot

and private investigator. Of note is an FBI report stating

that Ferrie placed at least six telephone calls to his

conduit with Marcellos, Attorney G. Wray Gill, during the

three-day period following the Kennedy assassination. David

Ferrie died

on February 22, 1967, from "a massive brain

hemorrhage," five days after being identified by District

Attorney Jim Garrison as a suspect in a conspiracy which

was responsible for Kennedy's death.

Marcellos is currently living in the New Orleans area.

MAYLOR, DEUTSCH "DUSTY MILLER": was head of the Teamsters Union

southern conference. He was also an associate of Jack Ruby.

MEYERS, EDWARD: is Lawrence Meyer's brother. Both men were

businessmen living in New York City. Meyers left New York

on November 8, 1963 to go to Mexico City. On November 18,

1963 he left Mexico City and went to Dallas. On November

21,

Meyers visited his brother Lawrence at his

motel around

midnight. Also present at this midnight "visit" was Jack

Ruby, to whom Edward Meyers was introduced.

MEYERS LAWRENCE V.: was, according to Warren Commission Exhibit

2267, a close friend of Jack Ruby. Meyers had visited Ruby

at his club and Ruby subsequently visited Meyers at his

motel on the night before the assassination. Meyers also

spoke with Ruby on the night before Ruby murdered Oswald.

Of note is the fact that on the night before the assassina-

tion, when Meyers visited Ruby he was accompanied by a woman

named Jean West, whom Meyers later stated he had known casu-

ally in Chicago. Jim Garrison later discovered in his 1967

investigation, that on September 24, 1963, the day that Lee

Harvey Oswald allegedly left New Orleans to go to Mexico City,

David Ferrie (in New Orleans) called Jean Aese West in Chicago.

Warren Commission Exhibit 2350 documents that this was the

same Jean West who accompanied Lawrence Meyers in Dallas on

November 21, 1963.

Lawrence Meyers is currently living in the New York City area.

MCLANEY, MICHAEL: On July 31, 1963 the FBI raided a house rented

by Mike McLaney. The house, in the suburbs of New Orleans,

was

apparently being used as a training center for anti-Castro

activities. Several of those arrested were associated with

Carlos Bringuier,

an anti-Castroite who became associated

with Lee Harvey Oswald in early August, 1963.

In September of 1973, an organized crime informer testified,

before

the

Jackson Subcommittee on Investigations. He alleged

that Mike McLaney, representing Meyer Lansky, offered him

$100,000. to assassinate the Prime

Minister of the Bahamas.

While McLaney and his brother, William, appear to have vast

organized crime connections and pivotal real estate holdings,

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FILES

I.

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Special Agent Lawn, Congressional Research Unit of

the F.B.I.,advised Select Committee staff in January that a

team of Bureau personnel had been preparing the following files

for review. These are described as the complete F.B.I files on

the investigation of the assassination.

62-109060 John F. Kennedy, 187 Sections

62-109090 Warren Commission, 32 Sections

105-82555 Lee Harvey Oswald, 238 Sections

Staff has begun a review and detailed indexing of the

Oswald sections. These sections roughly average two hundred

pages each and are comprised of non-classified internal memoranda,

general correspondence and field investigative reports.

Initial analysis of these materials indicates there is

a great deal of cross referencing and duplicity of Warren Com-

mission documents which are available at the National Archives.

For a thorough indexing, it has been necessary to proceed log-

ging-in all those documents available for review at the Bureau's

headquarters and compare our listings against those available

at the National Archives. Thus far we have found that what the

Bureau is providing is unique with respect to their own internal

memoranda, teletype and airtel messages. Items provided the

Warren Commission were often summaries of these communications.

The Bureau advises us that they have no index per se

of documents pertaining to their investigation of President

Kennedy's assassination. Their central card index makes reference

to file numbers for the subject of investigation and serial

---

## Page 40

- 2-

numbers for reference to specific areas of investigation of

those subjects. It is, therefore, as they explain it, a manual

process of searching through large bound volumes for a needed

document.

Our approach has been to compile an indexing of all

documents which will eventually facilitate access and retrieval

of documents pertinent to areas deemed worthy of further investi-

gation. During the interim, staff has been able to identify

certain areas of the F.B.I. 's Warren Commission investigation

which appear to be promising leads not previously pursued. These

leads have been identified by utilizing the somewhat indirect

indexing of F.B.I reports laid down in unpublished Warren Com-

mission documents at the National Archives.

Through comparison of Warren Commission testimony and

findings against F.B.I investigative reports leads such as the

following have been developed.

The Warren Commission testimony of Raymond Krystinik

appears in Volume 9 of that Commission's hearings. He was a

co-worker of Michael Paine, the man in whose home Oswald's wife

and child resided at the time of the assassination.

According to an F.B.I. report dated November 25, 1963,

which was part of the Warren Commission records, Krystinik had

occasion to be introduced to Lee Harvey Oswald at a meeting

of the American Civil Liberties Union. This meeting was held in

Dallas following the rather abusive reception United Nations'

Ambassador Adlai Stevenson experienced on his visit there one

month before the assassination. Oswald spoke up at the meeting

and opined that General Edwin Walker

was behind the incident.

---

## Page 41

- 3-

It should be pointed out that Walker, a local right-winger,

figured prominently in the Warren Commission investigation.

They reported that on the basis of available evidence, it was

most probable that Lee Oswald had made an unsuccessful assas-

sination attempt on Walker's life.

Getting back to Krystinik and the contents of the

F.B.I. report marked Warren Commission document number 75,

we find that Oswald and Krystinik that evening got into a heated

discussion of the merits of communism versus capitalism. After-

wards they are reported to have gone their separate ways.

Krystinik, accompanied by his wife, did something out of routine

for a devout Catholic who neither smoke nor drank. In the ten

years of their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Krystinik had never been

to a nightclub. On the same evening that they met Oswald, they

decide to see the floor show at the Carousel Club. The report

indicates they saw but did not speak with the club manager,

Jack Ruby •

When Krystinik testified before the Warren Commission,

he was not questioned regarding the contents of this F.B.I. report.

A member of our staff has made initial contact with Krystinik who

is still residing at the same place as when he testified before

the Warren Commission.

Another example of possible leads made available through

researching F.B.I. documents which the Warren Commission had is

the case of Dr. Orlando Bosch. Numerous publications have

recently focused on the terrorist activities of this man who is

perhaps the most infamous anti-Castro activist. Bosch is

currently in Venezuela awaiting trial for the bombing of a

---

## Page 42

- 4 -

Cuban airliner. American officials are seeking to question

him in connection with the murder of Orlando Letelier here

in Washington last September.

Our attention was brought to Dr. Bosch through an

indexing of F.B.I. documents first made publically available

at the National Archives in 1975. An unidentified F.B.I. in-

formant was reported on November 22, 1963, to have advised

that two brothers in San Juan, Jimmy and Victor Bosch, sup-

posedly had knowledge of the activities between Cuba and the

U. S. Upon interview Jimmy Bosch, who runs a nightclub, denied

any knowiedge of the assassination. Victor Bosch, an attorney,

refused interview.

We attempted to pursue Warren Commission records by

referring to various indices within that record group. The

largest of these, compiled by the Secret Service, has some

80,000 entries. Unfortunately, their entries refer to Secret

Service numbers assigned to Warren Commission documents and

no translation is provided between the two. Under Bosch, there

are three separate entries. Two of them refer to the documents

indexed and previously discussed. The third entry is for Dr.

Orlando Bosch and lists simply a Secret Service number. This

confirms that Dr. Bosch was of interest to the Warren Commission

and after extensive searching of non-indexed materials, we have

located that reference in a Secret Service document. It seems

that at the time

of President Kennedy's last trip to Miami,

Dr. Bosch organized a demonstration in an effort to embarrass

the Preisdnet.

The manner in which this document has been tracked

down is a good example of how new leads can be culled from

---

## Page 43

- 5-

previous investigations where significance was not apparent.

There

is in addition to the Bosch lead here an added utility.

An individual to whom we have made previous reference in brief-

ing memoranda, one Diaz Lanz, a/k/a Pedro Luis Diaz-Lanz, is

mentioned here as someone suspected of an attempt to embarrass

the President on his November 18, 1963, visit to Miami. Lanz,

a member of Cuban Brigade 2506, defected from Cuba with Frank

Sturgis and later joined with him on leaflet bombing missions

over Cuba.

As a follow-up on these leads regarding Bosch and

Lanz our research staff plans to expand a document search

concerning them at each of the investigative agencies.

II. Secret Service

As with the assassination investigative records of the

FBI, the Secret Service records we have examined are housed

both at the National Archives and at their headquarters. Per-

sonnel at the Secret Service have advised that all of their

original records were sent to the Warren Commission and

National Archives. What remains at the Secret Service head-

quarters is post-Warren Commission investigative files and

correspondence. Most

of their copies uf materials were destroyed

in what they explain to be normal records destruction procedures.

For these reasons the total Secret Service headquarters files

on President Kennedy's assassination are small in comparison to

those of the Warren Commission's chief investigators, the FBI.

Indexing and abstracting of nineteen numbered documents with

varying respective titles is nearly complete. These fill four

file drawers and are a combination of documents supplied the

Warren Commission and up to date records of the investigation

which was never oficially closed. In addition to the numbered

documents there are file folders containing correspondence with

numerous researchers, file folders containing miscellaneous

reports and files of news articles. Following is a brief des-

cription of the numbered documents reviewed so far.

A possible significant lead with respect to the Secret

Service investigation of the assassination was discovered when

a pair of newly available Warren Commission internal memoranda

was compared against previously published testimony.

Robert Inman Bouck, head of the Protective Research Section

of the Secret Service at the time of President Kennedy's assas-

sination testified before the Warren Commission in April of 1964.

Counsel Sam Stern questioned him regarding the Secret Service's

liaison arrangements with other federal agencies, noting that

Bouck had earlier said he thought they were satisfactory and

supplied the sort of information needed by Protective Research.

Bouck was asked why Oswald had not come to their attention. He

responded by saying no one knew enough about Oswald to judge him

to fit Secret Service criteria of presenting a threat to the

President; including the fact that he had a vantage point on the

the motorcade route.

Staff has located an internal memorandum by Counsel Stern

regarding a March 26, 1964 informal interview with Bouck. That

---

## Page 46

- 8 -

memo was withheld from research until 1973. It discusses

Bouck's firm position that a list of items of information

about Oswald which he has prepared and believes the FBI to have

prior to November 22, clearly warranted the FBI's advising the

Secret Service.

In a second Stern memo made available for the first time

this past March, a March 20, 1964 meeting is also discussed.

At that meeting, Inspector Kelley of the Secret Service was

present and concurred in Bouck's position that they would have

expected to be informed of Oswald since they would have regarded

him as a threat to the President and had him put under sur-

veillance. They go on to specify the reasons being the FBI's

knowledge of Oswald's defection, political pursuits, Marine Corps

training, job and family instability, New Orleans arrest and

Fair Play for Cuba activities, trip to Mexico City and visa

efforts there and, most

importantly, employment in the Texas

School Book Depository•

We have located Mr. Bouck, who is retired and living in the

Washington area. He will be another of many individuals involved

in the original investigation that can perhaps provide useful

information.

III CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

In their Warren Commission testimony on May 14, 1964,

CIA Director John McCone and Deputy Director Richard Helms

testified

that the substance of all relevant assassination

material had been supplied. In light of staff's initial

survey of Warren Commission records and documents made avail-

able to private researchers under the Freedom of Information

Act the sworn statements of these men are of questionable

accuracy •

According to Warren Commission document Number 49 an

FBI agent from the Washington Field Office interviewed Birch

O'Neal of the CIA on the day of the assassination. He

sought to obtain "any information" in the CIA files on

Oswald and was told there was nothing other than that fur-

nished them by the FBI and Department of State, That was

demonstrably false, particularly with respect to original

CIA documents on Oswald's trip to Mexico City.

Staff has secured a copy of the Agency's 271-page

Document Disposition Index. A legal document, it was supplied

under court order in the F.O.I.A. suit of Bernard Fensterwald.

It provides either descriptions of or reasons for withholding

documents compiled before the assassination on Oswald and up

---

## Page 48

-10-

to current activities relative to disclosure of their

assassination investigation materials.

CIA has provided the staff with copies of approxi-

mately 1500 pages of documents which have been made publicly

available thus far. This past December, the Chief of Re-

search and former Chief Counsel visited Agency headquarters,

were briefed on the J.F.K. assassination investigation files

and given a tour of their computer facilities.

J.F.K. assassination investigation files were described

as separate from the Agency's general files and are currently

in the process of being computerized. Staff was advised that

when appropriate security clearances are granted they will be

welcome to visit headquarters and be provided access to all

documents.

Based on analysis of CIA documents which are non-classi-

fied and available both at the National Archives and under

the Freedom of Information Act, we are in a position to cite

some specific examples of CIA withholding from, and deception,

with the Warren Commission.

An internal memorandum released under the Freedom of

Information Act in 1976 makes reference to Warren Commission

requests for information concerning photographs of a man who

visited the Russian Embassy and

possibly impersonated Oswald.

---

## Page 49

-11-

This memo, Number 250, advises that "we prefer to wait the

Commission out on this one". Another internal memo, dated

two days before the testimony to the Warren Commission of the

CIA director and deputy director discusses the upcoming

appearance. An Agency staffer, whose name is deleted, writes

that new information developed in the Mexico City investiga-

tion raises a number of new factors. The document, Numbered

298, continues that "this information should not be provided

prior to the Deputy Director's appearance since it could well

serve as the basis for more detailed questioning".

During the joint testimony of Mr. McCone and Mr. Helms,

which is found in Volume 5 of the Warren Commission hearings,

some rather strong statements were made under oath relative

to possible CIA contacts with Oswald. After describing the

thoroughness of their record search and staff inquiry, Mr.

Helms stated "

...there is no material in the Central Intelli-

gency Agency, either in the records or in the minds of any

of the individuals, that there was any contact had or even

contemplated with him..." (Oswald)

According to a CIA memorandum to headquarters on Novem-

ber 25, 1963 from an operative who had been following Oswald's

activities in the Soviet Union, the accuracy of Mr. Helms'

assertions are questionable. He writes that "I had discussed---

sometime in summer 1960.... the laying on of interviews"

---

## Page 50

- 12-

This document, Numbered 173a, goes on to discuss interest

in the information Oswald might provide on the Minsk factory

where he was employed and anything Oswald was possibly able

to contribute in developing foreign personality dossiers.

He concludes by saying that at the time he was phasing into

his next cover assignment and didn't know what action developed

thereafter.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: Summary and Conclusions

The concern of this portion of Oswald's life

is simply his activities in Dallas immediately preceding

the assassination. It was felt that his activities and

relationships in other locales, e.g. New Orleans and

the Soviet Union, were covered by other analyses.

Furthermore, in terms of the timing of the analysis,

it is clear that Oswald moved to Dallas shortly before

the assassination, and thus, an exploration of his

activities in the period preceding the assassination

should reveal his associations and patterns in Dallas

in general. These portions of Oswald's life can be most

fruitfully broken down in the following scheme:

A. Activities on November 22;

B. Relations and Associations in the Dallas

Community; and

c.

Employment and Living Arrangements.

---

## Page 52

I. ACTIVITIES ON NOVEMBER 22

The activities of Oswald on the day of the

assassination are the most crucial areas of inquiry in

the case.

They can best be summarized in outlines of

the evidence available at present concerning his

activities, as presented by the Warren Commission

Report, Exhibits, and testimony. Those outlines are

included below and preserted in three analyses:

A. Oswald As Lone Assassin

This is essentially the evidence used by the

Warren Commission to document its conclusion that Oswald

was the lone actor in the assassination of both Kennedy

and Tippit.

B. The Existence of a Conspiracy, Though Not

Excluding Oswald as Involved.

This is the evidence which indicates the existence

of a conspiracy, as collected from the Exhibits and

Documents produced by the Commission, and from analyses

of the Warren Commission critics.

C. Oswald As Not Involved in the Assassination.

Although there is some overlap in this outline

with (B), The Existence of a Conspiracy, this is a

collection of additional evidence which would support

---

## Page 53

- 3-

a conclusions that Oswald was not involved at all in

the events of the assassination.

What becomes clear from these analyses is that

the next crucial step in this portion of the case is

a precise, minute-by-minute chronology of Oswald's

activities on November 22. Timing is absolutely

essential to the findings of the Warren Commission,

and there are substantial areas of doubt about the

conclusions reached by the Commission. In particular,

the following areas are the most crucial, as well as

the least conclusive:

(1) Oswald's presence, locations, and activities in

the Book Depository;

(2) Oswald's escape from the sixth floor, if indeed

he were there, and his confrontation with

Officer Baker and Roy Truly minutes after the

last shot was alledgedly fired;

(3) Oswald's trip from the Depository to his

rooming house;

(4) Oswald's trip from the rooming house to

the scene of the Tippit murder; and

(5) His arrival at the Texas Theater.

Other topics of central concern must remain his

activities that morning. Doubt still remains substantial

---

## Page 54

- 4-

concerning his transportation of the rifle, and his

preparations that morning for the assassination.

In this regard, witnesses must be consulted

and an attempt made to verify his activities. In

this regard, Marina Oswald and members of the Paine

and Randle families are most crucial. Linnie Mae

Randle was a reliable and perceptive witness who saw

Oswald on that morning, and her son was a fellow

employee at the Book Depository who often drove Oswald

to the Paine home.

Attached are outlines of Oswald's activities on

November 22, as described above.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD AS ASSASSIN

I. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

A. Ballistics

1) CE 399:

The bullet was identified as having been fired from the

Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the TSBD and purchased

by LHO. There was a positive identification of the

bullet. Furthermore, the bullet was found on a stretcher

at Parkland Hospital, providing a crucial link between

the victims ard the particular rifle found at TSBD.

No other bullet and no other type of bullet was found

either with any of the victims or in the limousine, thus

pointing to the conclusion that no other rifle were

involved. (WR 79, 85, 93, 95)

TELES

2)

Fragments Found in Limousine

As with CE 399, the bullet fragments were positively identified

as having been fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano.

(WR 76-77, 87) These fragments were also found to be

covered by blood and tissue, implicating the rifle. No

other fragments were positively identified as having come from

any other scarce. (weight: 44.6, 21.0 grains out of 160-161.)

3) Spent Cartridges on the 6th Floor of TSBD

Three spent cartridges, positively identified as having been firec

from the Mannlicher-Carcano were found on the sixth floor

of TSBD near the window at which a rifle was seen during the

Although eyewitness reports are inconsistent

in terms of the number of bullets fired during the assassi-

nation, three spent cartridges, indicating three shots,

is consistent with the medical findings. WR 79, 84-85)

B. The Mannlicher-Carcano

1)

The rifle was found on the sixth floor of a building

from which shots were heard. Witnesses identified the

window at which the rifle was found as that from which a

rifle had protruded during the assassination. The rifle

---

## Page 56

(2)

matched the bullet and bullet fragments found with the

victims and in the limousine.

2)

3)

This rifle was owned by IHO, and there is no evidence

showing that the rifle wasrenoved from his custody.

There is evidence that IHO transported a package to

the TSBD; the package could be consistent with the

transportation of a rifle. The package was constructed

of materials to which IHO had access in the TSBD.

II. TSBD AS THE SCENE OF THE ASSASSINATION

A. Autopsy

1)

The autopsies performed on JFK shows that bullets

entered from the rear. In particular, the neck wound

shows clearly that JFK was struck from behind. There

are minute

bullet

fragments in the wound, and the clothing shows

an inward protrusion caused by a bullet entering from the

rear.

The head wound shows no clear front entrance

wound. There is a rear entrance wound and a massive wound

on the right

side of the head.

This also indicates

that the bullet came from behind and above the automobile.

2)

The trajectories of the paths of the bullets are consistent

with shots having been fired from the TSBD. Later

tests provide additional confirmation.

3)

A number of simulations conducted by the warren Connission,

while not as good evidence as the actual physical evidence,

show that the assassination could have occurred in the

manner which the physical evidence indicates. Tests

demonstrated that it was possible to strike a target several

times at the same distance as the car from the TSBD.

Furthermore, this could have been accomplished in a short

span of time - the span of time indicated in the Zapruder

film as the length of the assassination.

B.

Eyewitness Identification of the Rifle and Assassin at TSBD

Sixth Floor Window

1) A number of eyewtinesses to the event testified that they

saw a rifle protruding from the sixth floor of TSBD during

the

assassination. They also saw a man at the window and

noticed his movements during the assassination. In

particular, witnesses Brennan, Euins, Jarman, and

Williams saw or heard the rifle and shots from the sixth

floor of TSBD.

---

## Page 57

III. EVIDENCE LINKING LHO TO THE CRIME

A. Presence of IHO at the TSBD During the Assassination

1) LHO was an employee at the TSBD, and thus had access

to all parts of the building.

He was familiar with

the activities of employees there and with the

building in general.

2)

IHO was seen in the building, and on the sixth floor

inmediately before the assassination by Givens, a

worker in the building.

LHO was seen in the building immediately after the

assassination as well, and his presence, while not on

the sixth floor, can be verified by Baker and Truly.

4) IHO was in the TSBD at the time of the assassination.

Indeed, several witnesses, though not strongly credible,

testified that they could vaguely identify him as the

person in the windown with the rifle.

B. Ownership of the Rifle

C. Familiarity with Weapsons

1)

Although there is dispute as to the degree of expertize,

there is no question that IHO was familiar with weapons,

both through his military experience and from occasional

hunting trips.

2)

There is also evidence that IHO actually practiced with

the Mannlicher-Carcano. In any case, he owned the rifle

for a long enough period to become familiar with the

particular rifle.

IV. MOTIVATION AND OTHER LINKS TO THE ASSASSINATION

A. Tippit Murder

1) The bullets and casings which were involved in the

Tippit murder can be traced to LHO. The casings

given to the police by an eyewitness match exactly

with the gun found on LHO at the time of his arrest in

the theater.

The bullets cannot be matched exactly,

but are consistent with the gun which was found with

LHO at the time of arrest.

---

## Page 58

2)

3)

(4)

The murder of a policeman was viewed by several

witnesses who later identified IHO as the person

conmitting the crime.

The murder of Tippit provides a necessary link in the

quilt of IHO. It establishes that he feared the

police, and that he was reacting in an unusual manner.

There is no other explanation for the presence of the

revolver on his person or for an unusual reaction to

a meeting with a policeman.

This is especially so since

other employees at ISBD did not leave the building and

did not react in this manner.

THE EXISTENCE OF A CONSPIRACY: THE INVOLVEMENT OF MORE THAN ONE

ASSASSIN, THOUGH NOT EXCLUDING LEE HARVEY OSWALD

I. CE 399 DID NOT CAUSE ALL THE WOUNDS ATTRIBUTED TO IT

A. CE 399 Was Undamaged and Unmarked

1)

CE 399 weighed 158.6 grains out of a possible

160-161 grains.

2)

There was testimony, which was undisputed, that there

is a standard deviation of 2.0 grains in the weight of

that type of manufactured bullets. (Robert Frazier,

FBI, 3H 430). Thus, the slight loss of weight in this

bullet could be accounted for simply from deviations

in manufacture, within statistically permissable

bounds.

3)

The bullet was devoid of blood, tissue, fabric threads

or impressions. A bullet which passed through tissue

would leave such marks unless wiped off.

important, a bullet would retain the impressions of

threads even if wiped. (Testimony of Frazier that

the bullet was devoid of blood and tissue at 3H

428-429.

Testimony of Joseph Nicol re: lack of

threads and impressions from fabric or threads at

ЗН 505) •

B.

Expert Testimony That CE 399 Could Not have Caused Such Damage

1)

Drs. Humes and Flinck testified to the Warren Commission

that 399 could not have caused all of the wounds as

alleged under the Commission's "single-bullet theory."

2) Puni kely and Gregory termed such an occurrence

C. 399 Could Not have Caused Governor Connolly's Wounds

1) CE 399 could not have caused the fracture of the wrist

of Connolly. A hard-jacketed bullet of the type of 399

would have been damaged severely upon striking

resistant object such as a wrist bone.

Comparisons of

399 with other bullets fired through wrists of cadavers

shows this clearly. (HR 139, 141; photograph by

---

## Page 60

2

National Archives).

2)

CE 399 could not have caused the wound in Connolly's

thigh, since the fragment left in the leg, while

not removed, and thus not weighed, would probably

account for more than the total weight of the bullet.

3)

For similar reasons, the bullet seems unlikely to have

caused the wounds to Connolly's chest.

Although within

the realm of possibility, it seems likely that breaking

a rib would have caused more damage than that exhibited

by 399. There is the additional problem of the lack of

fiber, threads, or impressions, since the bullet

would have passed through cloth.

4) The Zapruder film shows a long delay between the

reaction of Kennedy to the wound in his throat and the

reaction of Connolly. The film indicates that JFK

reacts to the bullet in his back or throat by frame

225 of the film. Although there is dispute, it

appears that the wrist was not struck (Connally)

until frame 233. The film indicates through this time

delay that the wounds were caused by more than one

bullet, and additionally, that the delay was too short

a time for the Mannlicher-Carcano to be fired twice.

(SM 26-29) .

D. 399 Could Not Have Caused JFK's Head Wounds

1) A fairly large bullet fragment was found at the site

of the entrance wound in the head.

The "Clark

Panel" report which was released in January, 1969,

demonstrates that a fragment 6.5mm in diameter was

found at this alleged entrance wound. This would

eliminate 399 as the agent of this wound. (HR 115).

2) The head wound also shows

30 or 40 tiny metal fragments

in the head.

Humes testified that they were the "size

of dust particles." (2H 359). Kellerman testified

that the X-Ray showed "a mass of little stars." (2H 100).

In addition, a large quantity of brain tissue was

missing, raising the inference that a larger number of

such small fragments were in the wound. This also

eliminates 399 as the agent of these wounds.

3)

The laceration of the brain tissue was such that a

bullet such as 399 (hard jacketed) could not have

caused that damage.

---

## Page 61

3

4) Warren Commission simulations of the head shot demon-

strate that it is unlikely that one shot from Oswald's

position in the TSBD, firing the Mannlicher-Carcano

and hard-jacketed bullets, could have caused such

damage.

The Commission fired Mannlicher-Carcano bullets

into ten old skulls filled with gelatin. Of these,

only one exhibited damage in any way similar to the

head wounds of JFK. This one skull, however, showed

no laceration or disturbance of the gelatin (brain

tissue simulation). The massive disturbance of

JFK's brain indicates that either some other type

of bullet were used, or that more than one shot struck

JFK's head.

5)

The fractures of JFK's head were such that a very high

velocity rifle was used in the assassination. Humes

testified that the head wounds were typified by

a type of high velocity strike which extensively

fragmented the bullet and disrupted the skull. (2H 356)

The necessary velocity is estimated as higher than

2,700 f.p.s. (HR 120) The Mannlicher- Carcano 15

a medium-velocity rifle, with a muzzle velocity

of roughly 1,800 to 1,900 f.p.s.

E. 399 Could Not Have Caused JFK's Neck Wounds

1) Fragment

A fragment was found in the back or neck wound at the

point of entrance. The slight weight loss of 399

combined with the presence of the neck fragment makes

it impossible that 399 was responsible for this damage.

2) Lack of Fibers in Connally's Wound

There were no fibers found in the entrance wound in

Connally's back. The neck bullet clearly passed through

JFK's clothing, both in his back (through both shirt and

jacket) and possibly when passing through his anterior

neck (there is a possible nick in the tie he wore that

day). If 399 had passed through JFK before striking

Connally, fibers would have been found in his first

wound.

3)

Velocity

The velocity of the Mannlicher- Carcano was such that

merely passing through a 13 cm neck would not have

stopped the momentum of the missile. In order to

---

## Page 62

4

have stopped, 399 would have had to have struck

another object and would thus have sustained more

damage than evident from its condition.

F. Conclusions

1) The only possible wound which could have been caused

by 399 is the back or neck wound of JFK.

If 399

did cause this wound, however, it necessitates a

finding that all three of the bullets which were

allegedly fired from TSBD struck the Presidential

limousine.

A finding that all three bullets struck

a victim raises several problems:

(a) It is conceded that a bullet or bullet fragment

struck the street and injured a bystander (James

Tague).

(b) This necessiates thatLHO managed to hit his target

three times in an exceptionally small amount of

time.

Given doubts about his abilities and about

the possiblity of any marksmen having such success,

this raises the inference of another assassin.

(c) The Warren Commission concluded that only two shots

could have struck the car and its victims.

Their

evidence must somehow be rejected or rebutted in

order to establish that three shots struck the car.

The more reasonable conclusion is that more than one

assassin was involved, thus necessitating a conspiracy.

In order to account for all the bullets and all the

wounds, more than three shots would have to have

been fired.

II. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT MORE THAN THREE SHOTS WERE FIRED

A. The Mannlicher-Carcano Was Not The Only Weapon Used:

Medical and Ballistics Evidence

1) Fragmentation

The extensive fragmentation, especially in the head

wound, raises the inference that a soft-lead bullet

was used in the fatal shot. The Mannlicher-Carcano

bullets were hard-jacketed bullets and would not have

fragmented in this manner.

---

## Page 63

5

2)

The fractures of the head support the conclusion

that a very high velocity rifle were used, thus

eliminating the Mannlicher-Carcano as the weapon

used

for the fatal shot.

3)

The number of wounds and the evidence that 399 could

not have caused all the wounds attributed to it

necessitates a conclusion that a second rifle was

involved.

B.

The Mannlicher-Carcano Alone Was Not Capable of Such

Performance

1) Quality of the Weapon

The weapon which allegedly caused such damage has

been described variously as a "cheap old weapon"

by expert witnesses. (Latona testimony 4H 29).

2)

Dispersion of the Bullets

The Mannlicher-Carcano was not a very accurate weapon,

and had a dispersion of 12 X 12 cms

at 100 meters,

a rate which could possibly rise as high as 20 x 20

cms at 100 meters.

Renaud de la Taille,

Science et Vie

(December, 1964): "only a miraculous accident would

have enabled Oswald to place his bullets at only 10

cms of dispersion." (That degree of dispersion necessitated

by the feat allegedly performed.)

3) Two-Stage Trigger

The rifle found in TSBD had a two-stage trigger,

which would have increased the difficulty of the

shots allegedly made by Oswald, and rendered his feat

even more unlikely.

4) Defective Scope

The rifle had a defective scope, and was possibly

fitted for a left-handed individual.

C. Eyewitness Testimony Indicates That More Than Three Shots

Were Fired

1) Kellerman

Secret Service Agent Roy Kellerman heard a "flurry of

shots" within five seconds of the first noise, i.e.

after the first shot. (WR 50)

---

## Page 64

6

2) Amos Euins

Euins saw three shots from the TSBD, a-cording to his

testimony, but believed that there were four shots

fired.

3)

Brennan

Howard Brennan only heard two shots although he was

apparently in a position to have heard all the shots

from the TSBD.

This indicates that other shots came

from somewhere else. In addition, he testified that

he saw a "very deliberate aiming"

of the rifle in the

window of the TSBD. Such a deliberate aiming would

lessen the likelihood that all shots came from that

window in such a short span of time.

4) Jarman, Williams, Norman

These three witnesses testified that they heard the

hots so loudly that " they shook the building." They,

however, only heard two shots. If the shots were that

apparent, then they should have heard all three, or at

least three.

Since they did not, there is the inference

that other shots came from another location which they

could not hear as distinctly.

5)

Bennett

Glenn Bennet testified that the first shot missed, and

that JFK was struck in "rapid succession" by two shots.

This indicates that at least two assassins were involved.

(WR 111)

6) Other Witnesses

Other witnesses to the assassination in the vicinity of

TSBD heard five or six shots. (WR 110, n. 334)

III. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE SHOTS CAME FROM OTHER THAN TSBD

A. Zapruder Film

The Zapruder film at frame 313 et. seq. shows a reaction of

JFK's head which indicates that shots or a shot came from

in front of the presidential car. The head moved forward,

while at the same time debris from the head is evident in

the area of the President's head. Shortly thereafter,

the head was propelled backward violently, and the air

filled with debris from the head. The abrupt and violent

---

## Page 65

7

backward reaction of the head implies a strike from the

front. (SM 34 ff.)

B. Eyewitness Testimony That Shots Came From Elsehwere

C. The Grassy Knoll

1) A large number of witnesses reported that they heard

shots or saw smoke from the grassy knoll area.

(Article, "Fifty-One Witnesses and the Grassy

Knoll")

Among the credible witnesses who reported such activity

are: LEE BOWERS, MALCOLM COUCH, FRANK REILLY,

S.M. HOLLAND, ROYCE SKELTION, A.D. McCURLEY, J.L.

OXFORD, ALLAN SWEATT, J.C. PRICE, PAUL LANDIS, AND

JEAN HILL. (SM 18-21)

2)

Deputy Sheriff J.M. Smith found an alleged "Secret Service

Agent" behind bushes in the grassy knoll area at

12:36. The "agent" exhibited suspicious behavior and

immediately showed credentials to Smith, although he had

not asked for them. Records show that no Secret Service

agents were remining on the scene at this time,

but

accompanied the automobiles to Parkland Hospital,

staying with the persons whom they were to protect.

(SM 26)

IV. EVIDENCE THAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD IN PARTICULAR WAS NOT THE

LONE ASSASSIN

A. Eyewitness Reports

1)

Rowland

Arnold Rowland saw two men on the sixth floor of the

TSBD no more than 15 minutes before the assassination.

2) Walther

Similarly, Carolyn Walther saw two men on the sixth

floor at roughly the same time.

3)

No witness to the actions at the TSBD actually saw and

reported that he saw a rifle being discharged. A

rifle such as the Mannlicher-Carcano would have

shown

a discharge if it had been fired during the

---

## Page 66

8

time it was being viewed.

B. Oswald's Rifle Capability Was Not Equal to the Task Alleged

1) Military Experience

LHO's military records indicate that he was not an

exceptionally good shot with a rifle. Although he at

one time received a fairly high score, his marksmanship

was generally regarded as "fairly poor."

There

certainly is no evidence that he possessed the skill

to perform the feat as alleged in the Warren Report, let

alone the feat necessitated by the fact of CE 399, as

discussed supra.

2)

Practice

In order to perform ai this level of expertize, LHO

would have had to practice at some point relatively

recent in time with the assassination. There is no evi-

dence that LHO had the opportunity to practice with the

rifle, or that he in fact did so.

This conclusion

is also indicated that no other bullets for the

Mannlicher-Carcano were found in the possession of

LHO or in any of his possessions.

C.

The Rifle Marksmanship Tests Performed by the Warren

Commission Do Not Establish That Any Rifleman, Irrespective

Of LHO, Could Have Performed the Assassination in the Absence

of a Conspiracy

1) Superior Ability

The marksmen used in the simulation by the Warren

Commission were of vastly superior abilities to

LHO, and cannot be said to stand in his shoes in order

to prove that LHO could have accomplished the assassination

as a lone gunman.

2) Stationary Targets

The targets used in the Warren Commission simulation

were stationary.

3)

Test Results

Even given the fact that the targets were stationary and

that the marksmen were superior in ability to LHO, the

results were quite poor, both in terms of accuracy and

the time taken to fire three shots. They do not strongly

recommend that LHO could have fired three shots in such

## Page 68

LEE HARVEY OSWALD AS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT

KENNEDY

I. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

A. CE 399

2)

CE 399 was unmarked and due a large extent, undamaged,

weighing 158.6 grains out of a possible 160 to 161

grains.

There was

testimony which was undisputed,

that there is a standard

deviation of 2.0 grains in

the weight of that type of manufactured bullet.

(Robert Frazier, FBI, 3H 430) Thus, the slight loss

of weight in the bullet could be accounted for simply

from deviations in manufacture,, within statistically

permissible bounds. Additionally, the bullet was

devoid of blood, tissue, fabric threads, or impressions.

A bullet would retain the impressions of threads even

if wiped off if it had passed through clothing.

Problems in the discovery of CE 399 at Parkland Hospital

The stretcher upon which CE 399 was supposedly found

was handled at several points during the operations

at Parkland Hospital.

The bullet

was not located until

sometime after the presidential party had left Parkland.

In particular, after Governor Connally was transferred

to an operating table, a nurse removed the paraphernalia

on the stretcher (sponge, gauze, hypodermic syringe

wrappers, role of 1" tape).

then rolled the

sheets on the stretcher, one inside the other,

into a

small tight package which remained on the carrier. She

not see any bullet or hear one fall to the floor

during this procedure.

(6H 12i-1z3, SM175) Additionally,

the stretchers which had been used to transport both

JFK and Governor Connally to Parkland Hospital were left

unguarded on the ground floor for a substantial period

of time after the two men had been removed from the

stretchers.

CE 399 was found on the stretcher only

after they

had been left on the ground floor.

Thus,

CE 399 was found

considerably after the operations

at Parkland Hospital and after the stretchers had been

left unguarded in a position which was readily

accessible to the public.

---

## Page 69

- 2-

3)

4)

Problems in the Chain of Custody

CE 399 was found by the senior engineer in Parkland

Hospital who in turn gave it to the chief of personnel

who

then transferred it to a Secret Service agent.

The SS agent took custody of the stretcher bullet

the hospital

at

and returned to Washington with the

Presidential Party•

He gave the bullet to his superior,

Chief

James

J. Rowley, and Rowley in turn gave it to

an FBI agent.

In June, 1964, the Warren Commission

requested the FBI to establish the chain of possession

of the stretcher bullet. All of those who handled the

stretcher bullet, however, including the senior

engineer, the chief of personnel, the ss

agent, and

Chief Rowley were unable to make a positive identifi-

cation of the stretcher bullet as the bullet found on

the day of the assassination. (CE 2011) •

Evidence That CE 399 Could Not Have Caused Any

of the wounds to Either Governor Connally or JFK

There is substantial evidence that CE 399 could not

have caused any of the wounds to either Governor

Connally or JFK.

If CE 399 did not cause any of the

wounds, then there is no reason why the missle would

have been in the car or with one of the victims, thus

adding to a conclusion that the discovery of CE 399

was less than bona fide CE 399 could not have caused

the fracture of the wrist to Governor Connally.

hard-jacketed bullet of the type of 399 would have

been damaged severely upon striking a resistant

object such as a wrist bone.

CE 399 could not have

caused the wound in Connally's thigh either, primarily

since the nature of the wound was

such that only a

fragment rather than a whole bullet could have caused

the injury. For similar reasons, the bullet seems

unlikely to have caused the wound in Mr. Connally's

chest.

Although within the realm of possibility, it

seems likely that breaking a rib would have caused

more damage than that exhibited by 399.

CE 399 could not have caused JFK's head wounds

for

a variety of reasons. First, a fairly large bullet

fragment was found at the site of

the entrance wound

in the head.

More important, the head wound shows

30 or 40 tiny metal fragments, not only eliminating

399 but also implicating another type of bullet.

Additionally, the laceration of the brain tissue was

such that a bullet such as

not have caused that damage. Finally, the fractures

of JFK's head were such that a much higher velocity

rifle than the Mannlicher Carcano which Oswala

supposedly used was involved.

---

## Page 70

B.

- 3-

CE 399 could have caused the neck wound to JFK, but

the fact that there was apparently no exit for

the

bullet which caused

the back wound, combined with

the fact that a bullet fired with the velocity of

399 (1900 feet per second) would have passed easily

through JFK's body makes this extremely unlikely.

is thus no explanation for the presence of

399

in the car or with the victims, barring a demonstra-

tion that 399 somehow became lodged in the Presidential

limousine without having passed through any of the

victims.

The Bullet Fragments Found in the Presidential Limousine

Do Not Implicate Oswald in the Crime

The bullet fragments which were found in the Presi-

dential limousine, weighing 44.6 and 21.0 grains,do not

provide

a link between Oswald and the crime.

The fact

that this evidence as well does not link him to the

assassination is further evidence that he was not involved

in the crime.

First and most important, the bullet frag-

ments which were found were covered with blood. Yet,

according to the Warren Report, these fragments could

have caused any of the wounds to either JFK or Connally.

All of the wounds except JFK's head wound are attributed

by the Commission to CE 399.

Since the fragments were

covered with blood, the Warren must necessarily conclude

that the fragments

came from JFK's head wound. Yet, the

other evidence, including the laceration of the brain

tissue and the

large number of fragments in the head

implicates another type of bullet, not a bullet which

separated into several very large

fragments.

Again, since

there is no reason for the presence of the fragments in

the Presidential Limousine, a question is raised concerning

bona fide

nature of the

fragments and their use as

evidence against Oswald.

This conclusion is enhanced by the fact that these

bullet fragments were found very much later in the

evening on November 22, 1963.

They were not discovered

with a victim, but were found many hours later, and after

ample opportunity to manufacture evidence.

Furthermore,

spectrographic analysis which was undertaken of the bullet

fragments proved inconclusive; no other scientific tests

were performed on the fragments and no attempt was made

to link the fragments with other fragments found with

the victims.

---

## Page 71

- 4 -

C.

The Empty Mannlicher-Carcano Shell Casings

Even if the empty shell casings found on the 6th

floor of the Texas School Book Depository were in fact

fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, there is no

necessary link between these empty shell casings and

the victims. Furthermore, there is no evidence that

these shell casings were fired on November 22, 1963.

In addition, there were irregularities in the photographing

of their place of discovery on the 6th floor of the Texas

School Book Depository and in their finding by the police.

D.

The Mannlicher-Carcano Rifle

1)

The medical evidence shows that it is possible that

all of the wounds to both JFK and Connally were

evide te

caused by another type of bullet and another type of

rifle.

2)

The ownership of the rifle was not proved conclusively

to be that of Lee Harvey Oswald. Although purchased

under the name A. Hidell, this name could

have been

used by others with access to Oswald's alias.

3)

4.

A crucial piece of evidence in the case against

Oswald was the discovery of the brown paper package

allegedly used to transport the rifle to the Texas

School Book Depository.

This package, however, had

no oil stains and there were no creases in the pack-

age in locations which should have showed such marks

if a rifle had been transported in that period.

Oswald was in fact seen with the package on November

22 at the Texas School Book Depository.

The best and

most consistent testimony on that point, however, was

that the package transported by Oswald on that day was

much shorter than the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.

Limie Mae Randle who witnessed Oswald's arrival

at the Texas School Book Depository that morning,

maintained consistent testimony, through several

demon -

strations as well, that the packaged Oswald carried

was 27" long.

E. •

Palmprint on the Rifle

The Warren Report relied heavily upon a palmprint

of Oswaldfound on the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle discovered

on the Eth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.

Serious doubts must be raised, however, about the authen-

tisity of this palmprint, since there were irregularities

in the lifting of the print. The FBI, which

took custody

of the rifle, did not find any worthwhile prints upon close

inspection.

The print which was alleged to be that of

---

## Page 72

II.

- 5-

Oswald

was not discovered until much later, after the

rifle had been returned to the Dallas Police.

The print

was not sent to the FBI from Dallas until November 26,

1963, and did not arrive until much later. Furthermore,

the

Dallas Police did not check the rifle for powder

marks or for any metal fouling, so that there is no

varification that that particular rifle was in fact fired

on November 22, 1963.

F. The Rifle was First Identified as a 7.65 Mauser

Those who first discovered the rifle on the 6th

floor of the Texas School Book Depository identified the

gun as a 7.65 Mauser, rather than a Mannlicher-Carcano

rifle supposedly belong to Oswald. Deputy Constable

Seymour Weitzman, who along with Sheriff Boone discovered

the rifle during a search of the 6th floor of the

Depository, signed an affidavit for the Dallas Police

in which

he stated that "this rifle was a 7.65 Mauser

bolt action equipped with a 4/18 scope, a thick leather

brownish-black sling on it." (CE 2003, page 63)

G.

The Serial Number of the Mannlicher-Carcano Rifle Found

on the 6th Floor was not Distinctive

The serial number of the Mannlicher-Carcano Rifle,

C 2766, is not distinctive, but rather can apply to a

number of similar weapons,

possibly possessing the same

serial number.

The possibility that more than one such

rifles exists makes specific identification of the rifle

from the

serial number alone impossible.

THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY WAS NOT THE SCENE OF THE

ASSASSINATION

A.

The Grassy Knoll

1)

The clearest demonstration that the shots came from

the front is the Zapruder film.

In particular frames

313 et.seg. show a reaction of JFK's head which indicates

that shots came from in front of the Presidential

car.

The abrupt and violent backward reaction of the

head implies a strike from the front. In addition,

the action of JEK grasping his throat at frames

et. seg. is also consistent with shots coming from

in front of the Presidential car.

2)

A large number of witnesses reported that they

heard the shots and saw smoke from the grassy

knoll area.

The testimony of these 51 witnesses,

along with reports of suspicious activity in the

grassy knoll area is evidence that this location,

rather than the Depository, was the scene of the

assassination.

---

## Page 73

- 6-

B. Eye Witness and Photographic Evidence

1)

Dillard Exhibit C

This photograph, which was taken only seconds after

the last shot was fired, shows very clearly both

the 5th and 6th floors of the Texas School Book

Depository, including in the window on the 6th floor

allegedly used by Oswald to fire his rifle.

In the

photograph, several persons are visible looking out

the 5th floor window directly beneath the location

allegedly used by Oswald.

The persons in this window,

as demonstrated graphically by the Dillard photo,

show absolutely no alarm or surprise and have taken

no actions either to escape or to apprehena a gunman.

If the shots were loud enough to have been heard below

on the street, then they were certainly loud enough

for those directly below the shots to have heard, to

have been aware of the location of the shots, and to

have shown some alteration in emotions.

The reactions

of these witnesses indicate that the 6th floor of the

Depository was not the scene of the assassination at

all.

2)

Robert Jackson

Robert Jackson of the Dallas Herald, who was in the

motorcade, saw a rifle protruding on the 6th floor

of the Depository only after shots had been fired.

It was his feeling that no shots in fact did come

from this window, for he saw none even though he

was aware of the shots and took photographs of the

Depository •

3) Other Witnesses

It is significant that no witness testified that he

actually saw

smoke or a gun shot coming from the

6th floor of the Depository.

Even Howard Brennan,

whose testimony was relied upon to a great extent

by the Warren Commission, did not testify that he

actually saw a shot from this location.

Indeed,

no witness could actually testify that the shots

came from the 6th floor.

III. LEE HARVEY OSWALD IN PARTICULAR CAN BE PLACED OTHER THAN ON THE

SIXTH FLOOR OF THE DEPOSITORY AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION

A. Witness Identifications Before the Assassination

1) Bill Shelley

telephone shortly after 11:45 (he thinks approximately

11:55) on November 22. (7H 390)

2)

Ed Piper

Ed Piper saw and spoke to Lee Harvey Oswald on the

Ist floor of the Texas Depository at 12 noon (6H 383) .

3)

Carolyn Arnold

Carolyn Arnold testified that she saw Oswald on the

Ist floor as late as 12:15.

This is at exactly the

same time that Arnold Rowland

saw a gunman in a window

on the 6th floor. In addition, it corroborates Oswald's

story that he was on the Ist floor eating lunch at this

time.

Location After the Assassination

Oswald's location after the assassination can be pin-

pointed with even greater accuracy. Dallas Policeman

.Marion Baker and Roy Truly, manager of the Depository,

found Oswald in the 2nd floor lunch room within 90 seconds

after the last shot.

In addition, Oswald was found in the

vestibule of the lunch room, a position which is consistent

only with, having come up to the lunch room from the lst

floor, which is consistent with Oswald's version of the

events. In addition, several witnesses testified that the

gunman

in the 6th floor window withdrew the rifle from the

window

"very deliberately", and all state that the rifle

remained in the window for some time after the last shot.

This delay, coupled with the position of the Mannlicher-

Carcano rifle when it was found (hidden beneath carton;)

makes it impossible for Oswald to appear less than 90 seconds

later on the 2nd floor.

Furthermore, when approached by Officer Baker, Oswald

was "calm and collected",

according to both Baker

and Truly,

even_ though Baker Accosted him with a drawn gun.

Oswald

showed no emotion and did not react in an unusual manner

less than 90

seconds after the last shot had been fired.

Oswald reaction at this time is significant evidence of his

innocence.

The WC relied very heavily upon Oswald's

later alleged murder of Officer Tippit in order to show

a feeling of guilt on Oswald's part for

his earlier

assassination; his "unusual" reaction to being approached

by a policeman was used by the Commission as

evidence of his guilt of an earlier crime.

---

## Page 75

- 9-

4)

Early Police Radio Broadcast

Finally, in terms of identifying Oswald as the

assassin on the afternoon of November 22, 1963, the

police broadcast a description of th Oswald over

the

radio before they had talked to any witnesses

or received a description from Howard Brennan, thus

suggesting advance knowledge. At best it is

an

unusual circumstance.

IV. TIPPITT MURDER

The Tippit

According to the Warren Report,

the killing of Tippit showed guilt and apprehension, thus

fear of the police.

The issue of the murder of Tippit, however,

is a separate matter, for

it could have implications other than

those which were concluded by the Warren Commission and which

are unrelated to the Kennedy assassination.

It is clear,

though, that in terms of demonstrating guilt for an earlier

assassination of the President, the

lippit murder is

not

persuasive, given the earlier reaction to

Officer Marion Baker

in the Depository.

---

## Page 76

- 8 -

Yet the Tippit murder took place almost 1 hour after the

assassination.

The confrontation with Baker and Truly

took place less than 2 minutes after the assassination,

yet Oswald showed no emotion, let alone that which might

be termed

"unusual". Indeed, it is very surprising that

Oswald, when confronted by officer Baker with a drawn

gun, should remain "calm and collected", yet sometime

later when similarly approach led by an officer shoula

react with murder.

C. Altaens Photograph

D.

The Altgens photograph, taken of the Depository as

the motorcade passed, shows a figure on the steps which

closely resembles LHO. Although this person has been

identified as

Billy Lovelady, doubt must remain sub-

stantial. This photograph corroborates Oswald's version

that he was on the lst floor when the motorcade passed.

No Identification or Description of Oswald at the Sixth

Floor Window was Given

1)

Howard Brennan

Although Howard Brennan was relied upon to a great

extent by the Warren Commission in terms of

identifying Oswald at the

oth floor window,

his

description can have little probative value.

In the first place, Brennan was nearsighted and was

not wearing his glasses.

Second, the description

which Brennan gave to the police varied substantially

from Oswald's actual appearance. Finally, his later

lineup identification of Oswald was clouded by having

viewed Oswald on television in the interim.

2)

Arnold Rowland

3)

Arnold Rowland testified that he saw a Negro man in

the southeast corner of the 6th floor of the Texas

School Book Depository, not Oswald, who varies sub-

stantially from that description.

Amos Euins

Euins, as well as Rowland, testified that he saw a

Negro man

on the 6th floor of the Depository

building.

## Page 77

II.

RELATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE DALLAS COMMUNITY

The relations and assocations of Oswald in the

Dallas community is a topic which can be dealt with

rather quickly, though questions may be raised

concerning the nature of the investigation which

the Warren Commission undertook.

Their evidence shows, however, that Oswald had

few connections of any kind in Dallas. He was a loner,

who was described by those who made his acquaintance in

Dallas as rather unpleasant. Essentially, his

associations in Dallas were with other members of the

White Russian community. Those few contacts which he

made were usually with his wife Marina. With one

exception, those interviewed by the Warren Commission

liked Marina and did not like Lee. They thus

avoided contact with him, and knew little or nothing of

his personal life and personal views. Their testimony

is presented, in the short form which it deserved

considering Oswald's contacts with other human beings,

in Volume 23 of the Commission hearings and exhibits.

Also central in this regard is the testimony of Marina

Oswald, who did not like Lee at the time, and who may have

had ulterior motives in giving portions of her testimony

(i.e. the promise of remaining in America) .

---

## Page 78

- 2 -

As far as can be ascertained at present, the only

relationship which was of a substantial nature in

Dallas was that with George De Mohrenschilat.

An analysis of information concerning De Mohrenschildt

uncovered to date by the Committee follows.

---

## Page 79

GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT

In light of the testimony of Willem Oltmans

before this Committee, staff members have begun an

extensive investigation of George DeMohrenschildt.

The Committee has obtained from Patrick Russell

who was DeMohrenschildt's lawyer the following

items:

a. ten tapes reported to be taped conversations

between George DeMohrenschildt, Jeanne

DeMohrenschildt and Willem Oltmans made in 1967

b. George DeMohrenschildt's Texas drivers license

c. manuscript for proposed book by DeMohrenschildt

entitled I AM A PATSY: I AM A PATSY! (241 pages)

d. folio containing miscellaneous letters,

receipts, newspaper clippings and memorabilia

belonging to George DeMohrenschildt

e. photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald

The Committee is in the process of transcribing the

taped conversations between DeMohrenschildt and Oltmans.

The manuscript has been read and analyzed. Key statements

made by DeMohrenschildt in the manuscript include:

a.

Lee Harvey Oswald

is innocent of the assassination

of President Kennedy

b. Lee Harvey Oswald liked President Kennedy

c. Lee Harvey Oswald admired Premier Castro and

disliked Cuban refugees

who were anti-Castro

d. Lee Harvey Oswald despised reactionary groups

e. Willem Oltmans was convinced that DeMohrenschilat

planned the President's assassination and financed

it with Texas oil interests but this WAS NOT TRUE.

---

## Page 80

It should be noted that contrary to the testimony of

Mr. Oltmans, only one FBI Agent is named in the

manuscript and there is absolutely no indication that

this agent, the FBI, the CIA, H.L. Hunt or anyone

else known to DeMohrenschilt conspired to kill the

President.

The Committee is currently checking out everything

to which Oltmans testified when he appeared before

this Committee. This includes checking with all

airlines on which Oltmans and DeMohrenschilt allegedly

flew, hotels where they stayed as well as interviewing

all people with whom they came in contact.

The Committee has already spoken to Karl

Ekalraar who is the head of Dutch Television. He

has confirmed much of Mr. Oltmans testimony. However,

he states that at no time did Mr. DeMohrenschildt

make any admissions in his presence concerning

his involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy.

The Committee is now seeking to contact the Dutch

publisher with whom DeMohrenschildt allegedly reached

a verbal contact to write a book.

Another facet of the investigation concerns the

notebook and personal, papers which this Committee has

obtained. These have been analyzed by staff members

and the people mentioned will be interviewed as to

---

## Page 81

their knowledge of George DeMohrenschilt as well as

any information they may possess relevant to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

Finally, the Committee has obtained the Parkland

Hospital records of George DeMohrenschildt during

his stay at their psychiatric clinic. These records

clearly show Mr. DeMohrenschildt to have been

a very depressed and paranoid individual. The doctors

who treated Mr. DeMohrenschilt will be interviewed

about his mental condition and the Committee is

preparing to consult psychiatric experts to determine

whether George DeMohrenschildt was mentally fit

at the time he made his revelations to Willem Oltmans.

III. EMPLOYMENT AND LIVING ARRANGEMENTS

Again, there is little which seems of issue in

this regard, since Oswald's living arrangements

can only be described as Spartan, at least based on

the evidence presently known. He lived in his rooming

house on Beckley and attempted to save money from his

meager earnings. His relations with his wife were

strained, yet seemed to have reached a plateau of

sorts with which both Marina and Lee were content:

that is, seeing Marina on the weekends and living in

Dallas during the week. There seems to be some sort of

domestic tranquility which was established during the

months immediately preceding the assassination,

although Lee was never open in either his relations

or in his discussions of his thoughts. One possibly

unclear aspect of his personal living arrangement is

the relationship between Earlene Roberts, who managed

the rooming house and Roberts's sister, Bertha Cheek,

who was contacted on several different occasions by

Jack Ruby concerning real estate dealings. Another future

area of concern, more in terms of Marina Oswald than Lee,

was the strange and as yet unexplained relationship with

Ruth Paine, who undertook extraordinary tasks to help

---

## Page 83

- 2 -

Marina Oswald and her family (excluding lee, of

course). Trips to New Orleans to transport Marina

to and from Dallas are exceptional activities and there

is no adequate analysis of this relationship. This is

also true for the living arrangements of Lee and

Marina immediately before the assassination, as well

as for the existence of some of Lee's property --

primarily his weapons -- in the Paine garage. The

circumstances surrounding the Paine house and the Paine

household is the most crucial area of future concern in

this regard.

Concerning Oswald's employment, a number of

questions remain.

First is the employment with

the photographic labs at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. The

Commission did not adequately inquire into Oswald's

involvement with this firm. Although the Commission

presents a raft of information concerning Jaggars

(see Volume 23), this

information is of a perfunctory

and routine nature and does not add any analytical

perception concerning Oswald's relationships there.

The involvement of George De Mohrenschildt in this

regard must also be explored.

The employment at the Depository has been explored,

though not explained. In particular, there remains the

---

## Page 84

- 3-

question of why Oswald accepted this position when

the Texas Employment Commission had offered him another

position at a higher salary. The refusal of a higher

paying job seems unlikely, considering the apparent

desire of Oswald to maximize his income. Indeed, it

appears clear from the Commission testimony and

Exhibits that the lack of funds was a thorny problem for

Oswald. It caused great strains in his marriage

relationship, since Marina was encumbered in her activities

from the lack of funds, and seemed to require constant

relocation in different areas of the country. In

addition, persons who knew Oswald insist that he was

very concerned about his failure to provide adequately

for his family, and thought that this brought into

question his adequacy as a male (the Commission hints

that there were other bases for his concern in this re-

gara.

Concerning the procurement of the position at the

Depository, the testimony of the Randles is crucial

and has not been explored adequately. Linnie Mae

Randle's son worked at the Depository, and apparently!

it was through them that he obtained his position.

Oswald also had frequent contacts with him, and his

perceptions about Oswald's life are central.

JACK RUBY:

Summary

and Conclusions

I. SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE

The Warren Commission's exploration of the

issues surrounding Jack Ruby varies in quality

depending upon the nature of the topic considered by the

Commission. There is no question but that a very

deep inquiry was made into several areas of Ruby's life

and activities, and that the work of the Commission

cannot be faulted on this score. In particular, these

topics can be grouped primarily around Ruby's employees

and Dallas associates. The questioning of Ruby's employees

appears to be quite complete ard substantial: a very

large number were interviewed and every possible connec-

tion followed. This is true to a large extent as well

in the area of Ruby's associates, although in this

case, some associates from earlier times, especially

in certain areas, such as his links to organized crime,

were not questioned.

Part of the inquiry into Ruby, especially in

comparison with the other murders in this case (Kennedy

and Tippit), is made quite simple, if only because there

---

## Page 87

- 2-

is no doubt that Ruby actually fired the gun which

killed Oswald. As many commentators have pointed out,

the actual murder of Oswald was clearly the most viewed

homicide ever, at least from the standpoint that many

million television viewers saw Ruby shoot Oswald at the

very instant he pulled the trigger.

It is thus important to remember that the

inquisy into Ruby is not, as with Kennedy and Tippit,

an inquiry into ballistics and a determination of the

possibilities of the murder having taken place

according to any number of hypotheses. The

Ruby case

is simply one of finding a conspiracy. Ruby must thus

be approached in essentially the manner in which the

Warren Commission approached its task, that is, in terms

of Rupy's associations, for in those associations and

business transactions must lie any conspiracy which

may have existed.

In this sense, the Warren Commission explored

a number of primary areas of concern, the most important

being as follows:

(A)

Activities on 11/21 through 11/24

( B)

Business and Personal Associates

(C)

Possible Connections to Organized Crime

(D) Travels

---

## Page 88

- 3-

(E) Possible Association With Lee Harvey Oswald.

Although theCommission did a credible job in most of

these areas, with the exceptions listed below,

the general topic areas of Possible Connections to

Organized Crime (and participation in other illegal

activity in general) and Travels were not explored

adequately.

The conclusions which emerges from the Commission

REPORT, Exhibits, Documents, and testimony concerning

Ruby is that he was not involved in any concerted action

to eliminate the alleged killer of the president.

Ruby acted on his own, although the motivation for his

actions remain a mystery.

Perhaps the most reasonable explanation, at this

point, for Ruby's actions is that he acted irrationally

and impulsively, after having been caught up, as some

of the witnesses described it, "in the excitement of

history." This is not a far-fetched explanation, by

any means, since the picture which emerges of Ruby as

an individual confirms, above all, that he was capable

of irrational and impulsive actions: indeed, this was

a flaw in his personality which led many who otherwise

liked him very much to avoid his company.

---

## Page 89

- 4-

The other prominent trait of Ruby's character

is that he craved affection and an acknowledgement that

he was an important and worthwhile human being. He

was dependent upon other people to bring him happiness,

and clearly could not stand to be alone for even short

periods of time. He had to be the center of attention

and was also a constant bundle of activity: he had no

internal mechanism which regulated his activities, but

would clearly respond at any time to someone else. If

any person for whom Ruby had respect proposed any

activity, there is no question but that Ruby would

undertake the activity.

These two traits combined in the events of the

assassination to produce the murder of Oswald, at least

in theory. Ruby clearly became caught up in the whirl

of activity which surrounded the assassination, although

he previously had no strong political views and was not

an exceptionally strong admirer of Kennedy. It was the

most exciting thing which had happened in Dallas for a

long time, and Ruby had to be part of that frenzy of

activity (which he craved merely because it was frenzied).

He thus became involved in a whirlwind of activity, making

telephone calls, visiting the offices of the newspapers

and radio stations with kosher sandwiches, present at the

---

## Page 90

- 5-

Dallas Police station during any important activity,

present at Parkland Hospital, acting "as a reporter",

talking with District Attorney Wade, making comments at

news conferences, and finally, shooting Oswald. It was

Ruby's final and most assertive act to remain an

integral part of the drama unfolding in Dallas, undertaken

on an impulse. He undoubtedly would have been present

at the transfer of Oswald under any circumstances, since

he could gain admission through his relations with

police officers, and since he was "caught up in history."

Once inside the basement of the jail, he shot Oswald, for

no particular reason, but simply to remain part of the

drama.

II. ISSUES WHICH REMAIN DOUBTFUL

Although much of the Commission inquiry was

complete and substantial, there were several major

areas of conern which were not explored adequately in

the investigation undertaken in 1964. They can be

summarized as follows:

(1)

Organized Crime: almost no inquiry was made into

Ruby's connections with organized crime. For

example, his relations with Lewis McWillie,

a known crime figure, were minimized and

left at a superficial level. Mcwillie's

---

## Page 91

- 6 -

( 2)

connections to organized crime were substantial,

both in terms of his relations with Santo

Trafficante and the gambling establishment in

Havana, which Ruby visited at McWillie's

request and payment in 1959, and in terms of

his friendships in the gambling community in

Las Vegas. In addition, there is an indication

that there were earlier connections with

organized crime in Chicago, and perhaps later

in Detroit. Some of the other members of the

Ruby family were engaged in activities which,

although strictly legal, were on the fringes

of activity by organized crime. An example is

the appliance business in Chicago, where "off-

brands" were probably peddled under false

pretenses as better merchandise (at lower

prices). The Kefauver Committee also notes

activities of the Dave Miller gang in Chicago,

of which Ruby was a member. There were also

indications that Ruby was involved with crime

figures in the development of the Nationwide

Racing Wire Service (where John Roselli also

appears) and through former boxing associates

in Chicago.

Gambling and Other Crime in Dallas: this topic

of concern is different from involvement in

---

## Page 92

- 7-

organized crime per se, since it deals with

activities undertaken by Ruby on his own in

a small manner and not a part of the underworld

network. This is possible, given that as far

is known by some of the Mafia witnesses contacted

by the Comnittee (e.g. Charles Crimaldi), Ruby

was considered a "punk" and not really part

of any substantial operation for organized

crime. Thus, in Dallas, which was not a major

outpost for organized crime, it is possible

that Ruby was engaged in some small operations

on his own, which, despite their small size,

could certainly have major implications in

terms of associations developed with certain

elements in the Dallas community. Moreover,

these elments of the Dallas comjunity would be

more likely than others to have been involved

in some sort of assassination conspiracy.

The

Warren Commission included witnesses who

identified Ruby as involved in both gambling

and narcotics in Dallas (See Exhibits in Volume

23, especially Exhibits 1754-1774), but did

not pursue the information which it obtained

on any

sort of systematic basis.

---

## Page 93

( 4)

- 8-

(3)

Sale of Contraband to Cuba:one of the most

fascinating aspects of the Ruby case is the

attempt by Ruby to engage in selling contraband

to Cuba during the Revolution. After Castro

seized power, Ruby also apparently attempted

to obtain the release of some underworld figures

being held in Havana. The key witness in both

of these attempts to deal directly with Castro

is Robert Ray McKeown, whose testimony is

explosive, yet barely touched upon by the

Commission. McKeown, who knew Castro personally

(even to

the point of appearing in an embrace

on the front pages of Texas newspapers during

a trip by Castro to Texas in 1959), yet was

engaged in an unimportant restaurant operation

outside Dalias, had several dealings with Ruby.

His testimony seems reliable, yet there is no

mention of him in the REPORT, and his information,

which is substantial, is buried in a very short

Exhibit. This area must be explored.

Dallas Police: Ruby clearly had a large number

of friends on the Dallas Police force, and had

a great deal of reverence for law enforcement

officers in general. It is unknown, however,

which officers were special friends of Ruby,

---

## Page 94

- 9-

and what the Department's perceptions of

Ruby entailed. There is a substantial amount

of concern by the Commission for Ruby's

relations with officers, but, unfortunately,

this concern is never for the exacting details

of the relationships with the Department and

with specific officers. This is important,

clearly, in light of the admittance to the

basement of the building, and in terms of

Tippit and any possible involvement of the

Dallas Police or any of its officers in the

murders on November 22 and November 24.

( 5)

Parkland Hospital: according to two witnesses,

one of whom is quite clearly reliable, Ruby

was at Parkland Hospital on the day of the

assassination, at approximately the time Kennedy

was pronounced dead (and before the stretcher

bullet was

found). It is possible to explain

his presence there in the same manner as his

presence in many other places that day (such

as his continual presence at the Dallas Police)

that is, as his involvement in the history

and drama of the moment, yet certainly this

is a circumstance which needs more exploration

---

## Page 95

-10-

before such a conclusion can be adopted.

(6) Admission to the Basement: Ruby's admission

to the basement has yet to be explained. The

officers who might have allowed Ruby into

the basement were some of the best on the

force, and have repeatedly denied that he

was allowed in or that Ruby even appeared

that day. Furthermore, no one was ever repri-

manded for the affair, so that the Department

itsylf has never made a statement concerning

culpability. Even more important, the admission

of Ruby had to have occurred without great

difficulty, since the timing was very close.

Ruby was at the Western Union office a few

blocks away only minutes before the shootirg

of Oswald, so that Ruby could not have attempted

to be admitted and denied. He must have

entered quickly and without incident, and again,

with amazing speed and accuracy, appeared in

a perfect position from which to shoot the

prisoner. These events are all rather unlikely

on a coincidental basis. The admission and

position of Ruby in the basement are crucial

areas, and the Commission did little to clear

the

air.

---

## Page 96

(7)

(8)

-11-

Activities on November 24: there is a great

deal of doubt about Ruby's activities on the

all-important morning of November 24. Several

reputable and credible witnesses saw him at

several points near the Dallas Police Department

in downtown Dallas, yet associates who knew

him well insist that he did not leave his

apartment until very close to the time of

the shooting of Oswald. In terms of finding

an association which might indicate conspiracy,

his activities on that morning are essential,

and as yet unknown.

Larry Crafard: among his associations, Larry

Crafard is the most mysterious in the months

directly before the assassination. Ruby met

Crafard during the promotion of "How Hollywood

Makes Movies" at the Texas State Fair in October,

1963. The others involved in this production

are largely unknown and seem in some ways

nefarious. Crafard himself clearly is an

untrustworthy person whose activities are

suspect. Furthermore, Crafard's departure

from Ruby and Dallas on the evening of the

assassination raises many questions, none of

---

## Page 97

- 12-

which was answered by the Commission testimony.

Although the Commission did question Crafard

at some length and with some degree of tenacity,

his responses were inadequate and the mystery

concerning his departure remains. He is a

suspect character and his relationships must

be explored, as was not done by the Warren

Commission.

II. FUTURE AREAS OF CONCERN

As noted, the coverage of the Commission in most

areas of inquiry was fairly complete, aside from the

concerns listed above. In this sense, the next steps

must consist primarily of contacting, locating, and

interviewing witnesses. There are no records which would

further the inquiry at this point: the Commission

assembled all records relevant to Ruby's tax and financial

dealings, with negative results. Thus, the focus must

be on witnesses, in the subject areas listed above.

Certainly Larry Crafard and Robert Ray McKeown must

be two of the first contacted.

In addition, in questioning witnesses re: the

areas listed above, the interviews must be conducted

in a much more penetrating manner. The Commission did not

---

## Page 98

- 13-

force the witnesses in any aspect of the Ruby case

to answer penetraing or difficult questions; indeed,

the major concern of the FBI interviewers seemed to be

Ruby's sex life and possible homosexual activities

(which appears unlikely as well as totally irrelevant to

the inquiry).

TIPPIT MURDER: Summary and Conclusions

I. SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE

The Tippit murder is by far the least explored area

of the JFK assassination. This is unfortunate, since the

Warren Commission, as well as post-hoc analysts, rely upon

Oswald's alleged guilt in this crime as a major link in the

chain of evidence against him. In terms of both the

Warren Commission and the supporters of the arguments

advanced in those volumes, the Tippit murder is used

as circumstantial evidence to show that:

(1) Oswald was capable of murder; and

(2) His guilt in the JFK assassination a short while

before was the basis for his extreme paranoia and

his unusual reaction to being stopped rather

casually (about which there is little debate) on

the street by a policeman.

Given the importance which these supositions assume, the

paucity of information and effort expended on this portion

of the case is alarming.

After rather perfunctory testimony from a small number

of witnesses, the Warren Commission seemed to have no doubt

that Oswald in fact murdered Tippit, despite a lack of

---

## Page 103

- 2-

detail concerning the time and circumstances surrounding the

presence of Tippit in that area and his reasons for

accosting Oswald. In essence, the Warren Commission

relied upon witness identifications made at the time of the

assassination, and upon ballistics evidence.

The witness identifications take major importance

to the Commission. Two witnesses, Willima Scoggins

and Helen Markham, identified Oswald as the person who

actually fired a gun at Tippit. Seven other witnesses

identified Oswald as the man whom they saw escaping from

the scene of the crime shortly after the shooting.

The ballistics evidence, while to some degree

inconclusive, was also relied upon, although the Commission

makes much less use of this ballistics evidence than in

other portions of the case. In essence, the ballistics

tests showed only that the bullets found in Tippit's body

were "consistent" with having been fired from the gun

which was allegedly found with Oswald in the Texas Theater.

• II. ISSUES WHICH REMAIN DOUBTFUL

In light of the paucity of evidence received by the

Commission, as well as its quality, the Tippit murder

presents a large number of issues which are clearly

questionable. Furthermore, it is evident that even more

---

## Page 104

- 3-

doubts would be raised if more were known: at this point,

so little has been revealed that there is no basis for

proposing counter hypotheses. The major areas of doubt,

which was not aided by the Warren Commission remain

as follows:

(1) Why was Tippit present in that area at that time,

given that his district was several miles away

from that area and since he had been given no

instructions to move into that position;

(2) Why did the Dallas Police Dispatcher continually

place calls to Tippit, even after he was shot,

when he was not known to be in the area, and was

hardly a prominent member of the force;

(3) Why did Tippit stop on Beckley Street near Oswald's

rooming house a few minutes before he was shot some

eighteen blocks from that spot.

(4) Timing: the precise timing of the murder remains a

mystery. The Warren Commission places the murder

at approximately 1:15, although two key witnesses

(Helen Markham -- important to the Warren Commission

though of questionable perception-- and T.F. Bowley)

place the event much closer to 1:10. Tippit must

have been shot before 1:16, which is when the call

placed from car number 10 was received by the Dallas

---

## Page 105

- 4 -

Police Department. Oswald must thus have shot

Tippit by 1:15, since it must have taken some

short amount of time for the call to have been

placed on the radio. In this case, Oswald must have

arrived at the scene before 1:15, since he apparently

spoke with Tippit for perhaps a minute before the

shooting took place. The timing of Oswald at the

scene thus does become closer to 1:10 than 1:16.

Under these circumstances, timing is crucial, since

it is established that Oswald did not leave his

rooming house until after 1:00, and needed to walk

eighteen blocks in a very short span of time. It is

estimated that such a walk would take ordinarily

eighteen minutes -- the placing of the crime at a

substantially earlier time confuses the issue of the

presence of Oswald at Tenth and Jefferson;

(5) Calm Demeanor: the Warren Commission testimony is

undisputed that both Oswald and Tippit exchanged

no hostile language or appeared in any way to be

excited at the time of the shooting. Tippit had

not drawn his gun, did not call for help on his

radio, and did not indicate in any way that trouble

was expected. He apparently made no threats or

moves to arrest Oswald, so that the motivation for

shooting Tippit remains a problem;

---

## Page 106

- 5-

(6) This unusual response to an apparently calm

situation contrasts remarkably with the earlier

experience in the Book Depository with Officer

Marion Baker and Roy Truly less than three minutes

after the last shot was alledgedly fired. Even

though Baker had drawn his gun in the Depository

and Tippit had not, Oswald allegedly responded with

murder in the calm situation and with sang-froid

in an atmosphere of tension only moments after killing

a president;

(7) The testimony of Officer N. M. McDonald concerning

the capture of Oswald in the Texas Theater is of

questionable validity, as is the testimony

of store keepers which led to the identification of

the Texas Theater as the hiding place of the suspect;

(8) The lineup identifications of the key witnesses in

the case -- Helen Markham, William Scoggins,

Domingo Benavides, and Ted Callaway -- are all

suspect, and were used extensively by the Warren

Commission in identifying Oswald as Tippit's killer.

Markham was hysterical at the time of the lineup

(later on the afteroon of the murder), and even

when questioned later by the Commission, gave

incoherent testimony. Benavides, who was perhaps

no more than fifteen feet from the shooting, said

at the time of the murder that he was unable to make

---

## Page 107

- 6-

an identification of the killer. Although he did

attempt to make such an identification later, this

post-hoc claim is not extremely probative.

Scoggins, who was the most trustworthy of the

witnesses in the Tippit case, made a positive

identification of Oswald, but according to the

statements of fellow cab driver William Whaley, who

was present at the time that Scoggins made his

identification, there was no question that Oswald

was the suspect. The other three men in the lineup

were Dallas police officers and, although they stated

fictitious names, Oswald was forced to state his

real name and occupation, giving his employer's

address at the School Book Depository. In addition,

Whaley testified that Oswald was uncooperative,

while the others were complacent, kaming it even

more evident that he was the suspect. Similar

problems exist for all of the witnesses who made lineup

identifications of Oswald, so that they must all

be questioned;

(9) Several witnesses are either unknown or were never

questioned by the Commission, including most of the

audience in the Texas Theater and several persons

on the streets which Oswald supposedly used as

means of escape; and

---

## Page 108

- 7 -

(10) The Warren Report does not include an autopsy

materials on Tippit, and apparently never inquired

into the matter. This was obviously crucial, given

the reliance on ballistics tests and the uncertain

nature of the ballistics results.

III. FUTURE AREAS OF INQUIRY

The future exploration in this area must be extensive;

indeed, as discussed, there was so little testimony taken

concerning Tippit that it is difficult to point specifically

to tasks which must be undertaken.

Without doubt, however, several steps may be identified

as appropriate. First, all witnesses questioned by the Com-

mission must be interviewed and hard questions posed.

Second, additional witnesses must be identified and

all those not originally interviewed should be approached.

Dispatch records for the cab company employing William

Scoggins should be viewed, since he testified that he

called immediately after the shooting to request that an

ambulance be sent at the scene. This was apparently not done,

although the timing is crucial and as yet inverified.

Finally, Dallas Plice records must be obtained and

analyzed for the following information:

(1) The precise locations and dispatch signals to

---

## Page 109

- 8-

Officer Tippit;

(2) Complete information concerning the lineups

conducted and the procedures used, including

statements made by the police to the potential

witnesses; and

(3) Complete records of all arrests and suspects

questioned in the entire area during that day.

This

information is essential to ascertain the liklihoo

of Tippit stopping Oswald in such circumstances,

and for discovering general police practices

in

Dallas.

Witness:

DOMINGO BENAVIDES

6 H 444

I. WARREN REPORT

A. Personal Information

At the time of the assassination, Benavides

was 26 years old and employed as an automobile

mechanic for the D-otch Motor Company in Dallas, with

offices around the corner from the scene of the Tippit

murder. This establishment is also the employer of

TED CALLAWAY and SAM GUINYARD, also witnesses in

the case. Benavides had only a tenth grade education,

but was fairly articulate, given his background, in

his testimony. The testimony, byt the way, was quite

perfunctory and certainly not undertaken with the

degree of care and skill which was deserving such a

crucial witness in the case.

B. Summary of References in the Warren Report

According to the REPORT, Benavides stopped his

---

## Page 112

- 2-

truck when he heard a gunshot. At the time he was

25' from Tippit's squad car. Benavides called on

Tippit's radio to report the murder and then left the

scene. He returned later to pick up two empty shell

casings which he observed the escaping gunman eject.

He did not make a lineup identification because he said

that he did not get a long enough view of the

suspect. It is clear, however, from the description

which Benavides later provided at his testimony before

the Commission, that he provided the most detailed descrip-

tion of any of the Tippit witnesses.

II. TESTIMONY BEFORE THE WARREN COMMISSION

A. Description of Actions and Locations

At the time of the Tippit murder, Benavides had eaten

lunch and was headed west on Tenth Street in his truck

on an errand for Dootch Motors, his employer. He saw a

police cruiser headed in the opposite direction,

though when he first saw the car, it had stopped, and

the officer was standing next to the driver's side door.

Benavides only saw the officer after Tippit had gotten

• out of his car. He also saw another man standing on the

---

## Page 113

- 3-

opposite side of the car.

At this point, Benavides heard one shot. He

turned his truck into the curb, hit the curb and

stopped, and ducked down, as he heard two more shots

(three total). He was stopped fifteen feet from the

police car. He saw Tippit fall, although he said

nothing as he fell. Upon inspection, Benavides

saw that Tippit had his gun in his hand, and was lying

partially on his gun and partially on his hand.

Benavides saw (before inspecting the body)

the suspect fleeing from the scene. As the suspect

left, he ejected two shells from his gun at the location

of the murder, and left at a "pretty good trot."

Benavides entered Tippit's car and called

headquarters on the radio to report the murder.

Another passerby stopped at this point, but Benavides

does not know his identity. He also notes that another

auto was stopped in front of him, and a man about 25-30

years of age (driving a red Ford) also saw the murder.

This witness remains unidentified.

Later, Benavides went back to the scene (about

4:00 p.m.) and picked up the two shells which he had

seen the suspect eject and turned them over to the police

in a cigarette package to avoid putting on his fingerprints.

Benavides provided the most complete description

of the suspect. He was described as 25 years of age

and about 5' 10". He was wearing a light beige jacket,

dark trousers, and a dark shirt. He was of average weight

and had curly hair (neither dark nor brown) and a dark

complexion (which varies substantially from Oswald's

facial appearance) .

C. Placement of Other Witnesses

TED CALLAWAY: asked to pursue the suspect in

Benavides' truck.

SCOGGINS: describes the cab and that SCOGGINS left

with CALLAWAY TO pursue the suspect.

SAM GUINYARD

Unidentified driver.

D. Police Lineup and Identification

Benavides did not desire to make a lineup identifi-

cation, feeling he had inadequate time to view the suspect.

He later did make an identification of the suspect as

Oswald, but this was months later and after a deal of

pressure to make the identification.

E. Crucial Documents

None.

III. COMPARISONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Benavides was the most percipient witness to

the Tippit murder and gave the most accurate

description of the suspect. His testimony is

crucial as to the timing (he believed that the shooting

took place at about 1:00 p.m., which is earlier

than the Warren Commission places the event.

Also, his identification and description of the

suspect is at odds somewhat with the other descriptions.

He is a reliable witness and must be questioned further.

Tippit Murder

Witness: TED CALLAWAY

3 H 351 et. seg.

I. WARREN REPORT

A. Ted Callaway: Personal Information

At the time of the assassination Callaway was 40 years old and

employed as a used car salesman at Harris Brothers Auto Sales, located

at 501 East Jefferson, the northeast corner of 10th and Jefferson.

Callaway was raised in Dallas, went to school in Dallas, and completed

2 years of college at Southern Methodist University. He served in

the Marines for a period of 3 years and received an honorable discharge

in 1954. Callaway had no police record.

B. Summary of References to Callaway

According to the Warren Report, Callaway heard the sound of shots

to the north of the used car lot where he was employed. After hearing

5 gun shots, he immediately ran to the sidewalk on the east side of

Patton to a point about half a block south of 10th Street. At this

point, Callaway saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held

high in his right hand. Callaway saw this man cross to the opposite

side of Patton whereupon Callaway yelled to the man from across the

street, "Hey, man, what the hell is going on?"

Callaway then continued to the intersection of 10th and Patton

where he found Officer Tippit's gun where it lay beneath him outside

of his holster. At this point, Callaway and William Scoggins attempted

to follow the gunman in Scoggins' taxicab.

On the evening of November 22, Callaway viewed the same lineup

of 4 men from which Mrs. Markham had earlier made an identification

of Lee Harvey Oswald. Callaway stepped to the back of the lineup

room and made a positive identification of Oswald. Callaway testified

that he had not been shown any pictures by the police before the lineup.

II. TESTIMONY BEFORE THE WARREN COMMISSION

A. Description

l of Actions and Locations

At around 1:15 on November 22, Callaway was standing on the front

porch of the office of the Harris Brothers Auto Sales car lot at 501

East Jefferson. He heard the sound of 5 pistol shots coming from the

back of the lot toward 10th Street. Callaway then ran out onto the

sidewalk on Patton Street, where he saw a man crossing from one side

of the street to the other. Callaway states that he "hurried" from

his position on the porch to his position on Patton Street. Callaway

testified that he stayed in this position until the man whom he had

viewed earlier passed him on the other side of Patton, and Callaway

turned and spoke to the man behind him, whom he later identified

aS

B.D. Searcy, telling Searcy to, "Keep an eye on that guy; follow

him."

Callaway then ran, at a "good hard run," up Patton to the

corner of 10th and Patton. Callaway saw a squad car and a group

of 4 or 5 people and a couple of cars that had stopped. He approached

the squad car, and saw Tippit lying in the street; whereupon Callaway

ran over to the squad car, got on the police radio and called in a

---

## Page 119

- 3-

report that a man had been shot, telling the police the location.

The police told him to get off the air and that the shooting had

already been reported.

Callaway then approached Tippit's body and rolled it over,

finding a pistol underneath him. Callaway testified that the gun

was out of the holster and that the holster was unsnapped. Callaway

picked the gun up and put it on the hood of the squad car, and then

helped load Officer Tippit into the ambulance.

Callaway persuaded Scoggins to take him in his taxicab in an

attempt to locate the man whom he had seen running down the street.

Callaway describes the path taken by he and Scoggins as follows: north

on Patton to 10th Street; west on 10th Street to Crawford; south on

Crawford to Jefferson Boulevard; west of Jefferson to Beckley; they

then circled around several blocks and ending up coming back to Patton

and 10th Street. Callaway's further connections with the case were

later that evening at the police station where he made a lineup

identification of Lee Harvey Oswald as the man

whom he saw running

down Patton Street.

B. Description of Lee Harvey Oswald

Callaway testified that he first saw Lee Harvey Oswald cutting

from the east side to the west side of Patton. At this time, the

man had a pistol in the raised position, with the muzzle pointing

upward and the arm bent at the elbow. Callaway estimated that the

man at his closest distance was about 56 feet away from Callaway;

that distance was measured with a tape measure in a reconstruction of

the scene done by the Warren Commission.

Callaway gave a description to the police officers at the scene

---

## Page 120

-4-

of the murder on November 22. He described the man as about 5'10"

tall, weighing about 160 lbs. The man was "neither fat nor thin,"

and was of fair complextion with dark hair.

The man was wearing dark trousers with a light tanish-grey

windbreaker jacket, with a white tee-shirt underneath. Callaway also

stated that he saw the face of the man running, and that he saw the

front of the face with a good view. When Callaway spoke to him from

across the street, the man was running at a "good steady trot, not

real fast" but slowed down and almost stopped when Callaway spoke to

him. The man said something to Callaway that Callaway could not

understand, and after speaking to Callaway, the man resumed his progress

at about the same pace as before Callaway spoke with him.

C. Placement of Other Witnesses at the Scene

1) William Scoggins

Callaway states that as he ran out onto the sidewalk on Patton

Street, he saw a cab driver beside his cab parked on Patton. The cab

was parked on the east side of Patton and Callaway states that he

saw this man beside the cab at the same time that he saw Oswald cut

from one side of Patton to the other. This places Oswald between

him and Scoggins. This testimony would lead to a conclusion that

Scoggins was in a position to view clearly the suspect as he crossed

Patton near the taxicab. In addition, Callaway places Scoggins with

the group of people, Tippit's body, and Tippit's squad car immediately

after the killing.

2) B.D. Searcy

Callaway places Searcy behind him on Patton at the time that

Oswald crossed Patton running towards Jefferson Boulevard. Searcy

---

## Page 121

- 5-

was, according to Callaway's testimony, near Jefferson Boulevard, and

in a position to see Oswald as he ran down Jefferson Boulevard.

Callaway makes no further mention of Searcy, and he is not one of the

witnesses relied upon by the Warren Commission Report. He was not

interviewed by the Commission.

3) Sam Guinyard

Sam Guinyard worked at Harris Brothers Auto Sales with Callaway.

In his testimony, however, Callaway makes no mention of Guinyard's

position or his view of the killing or of the alleged escape of Oswald.

The only reference to Guinyard is that Guinyard accompanied Callaway

to the police station later that evening when Callaway and Guinyard

made a lineup identification of Oswald.

4) Other Individuals

Callaway mentions that there were 4 or 5 other people who had

gathered near the squad car at the time he arrived after running up

Patton. He does not identify any of these individuals by name.

D. Police Lineup and Identification

Callaway went to the police station at around 6:30 or 7:00 that

evening, accompanied by Sam Guinyard. He was met by detective Jim

Leavelle. Also present was Cecil J. McWatters, the driver of the bus

which Oswald allegedly took after leaving. The lineup contained 4 men

including Lee Harvey Oswald. Callaway testified that he stepped to the

back of the room so that he could "kind of see him from the same distance

which I had seen him before." Callaway made a positive identification

of Lee Harvey Oswald as the man he had seen running across Patton Street,

stating as well that Oswald had on the same clothes minus the jacket.

It was Callaway's testimony that he had seen no pictures of

---

## Page 122

-6-

Oswald in the newspaper or on television before he made the lineup

identification. He stated that he had "hadn't seen

a newspaper, hadn't

even heard a radio, really." He was not shown any pictures of the man

before the lineup took place, but he did testify that of the 4 men,

Oswald was the shortest, though they were all of about the same age.

E. Documents or Exhibits Used or Referred to During Testimony

1) Commission Exhibit 537

Commission Exhibit 537 was a diagrom of the area in which the

actions took place. Callaway marked this exhibit with an X on the

location of the used car lot where he worked.

2) Commission Exhibit 538

Commission Exhibit 538 was identified by Callaway as a picture

of the office in which he worked at the Harris Brothers Auto Sales

used car lot.

3) Commission Exhibit 539

Commission Exhibit 539 identifies the location of Callaway when

he saw the man running across Patton Street. Callaway identifies his

position as point 27 on the chart, and identifies point 29 as the

position of Scoggins' taxicab.

III. COMPARISON AND CONCLUSIONS

Callaway's testimony before the Warren Commission does not differ

materially from the summary of his testimony given in the Warren Report.

There are, however, some problems with Callaway's testimony before the

Warren Commission. At several points Callaway offers information which

he could not have known on a first-hand basis.

At one point Callaway states that Oswald was "headed right towards

the Texas Theater." He made this comment in reference to Callaway's

---

## Page 123

-7-

conclusion that if he and Scoggins continued up Jefferson Boulevard

in their pursuit of Oswald, they would have found him, since he was

on his way to the Texas Theater. It is clear that at this point

Callaway is projecting information which he later obtained into this

testimony before the Commission. Similarly, when describing the

clothing worn by Oswald in the police lineup, Callaway testifies that

Oswald had "ditched his jacket." Again, this in some degree calls into

question the value of his testimony before the Warren Commission as

present-sense recollection, since there are several instances of his

projecting information which he later obtained into supposedly present-

sense impressions.

In addition,

according to Callaway's testimony, there are problems

with the lineup procedure in the Dallas Police station which may call

into question his positive identification of Oswald. According to

Callaway, Leavelle, the detective in charge of the lineup procedure,

stated to the witnesses present that "we want to be sure, we want to

try to wrap him up real tight on killing this officer. We think he

is the same one that shot the President. But if we can wrap him up

tight on killing this officer, we have got him."

Thus, to some extent, the police placed pressure on Callaway to

make a positive identification, and also gave information which was

not necessary or pertinent to the identification of Oswald as the

killer of Tippit, i.e. Leavelle's belief that Oswald was also the

killer of the President. This certainly would add greater incentive

for Callaway as well as the others to make a positive identification

of Oswald, since an eye-witness identification of the killer of the

President would heighten the witness's import.

7 H 153

A. Personal Information

None given of any import.

B. Summary of References in Warren Report

Davis heard the sounds of gunshots and went

to the door of her house whereupon she saw a

man cut across her yeard, apparently shaking

cartridges from a gun.

Davis called the police

and later aided them in a search for empty

cartridges in her lawn.

She later found an

empty shell and also identified Oswald at a

lineup held that evening in the Dallas Police

Cepartment.

---

## Page 126

II. TESTIMONY BEFORE THE WARREN COMMISSION

A. Description of Actions and Locations

Davis heard two gunshots, although the timing

was not clear, since she was at the time in bed in her

apartment.

She rushed to her front door, and saw

Helen Markham screaming for help.

Alerted by Markham's

screams, she then saw a

man crossing her lawn emptying

a gun.

She did not see the man throw anything away,

however.

Davis then called the police and went to aid

Tippit.

Later that day, at the request of the police, she

searched her yeard and found one empty shell near some

bushes.

B. Description of Lee Harvey Oswald

At the lineup, Davis stated that she recognized

Oswald primarily "from his clothes, and from his face,

mostly." It seems clear, however,

that her recognition

came only from the clothes, since this was the only reference

she made in later testimony before the Commission.

Davis stated

that her main recollection was that

the suspect was wearing a dark jacket of a wool-like

material, similar to

a hunting jacket.

She was certain

that the material was not as light as the jacket shown

to her by the Commission.

In addition, she stated that CE 150, which was

Oswald's shirt was much darker than the shirt which

she saw on the suspect.

---

## Page 127

C: Placement of Other Witnesses

Davis placed HELEN MARKHAM next to the body of

Tippit, and stated that she pointed to the man escaping,

thus alerting her to the man crossing her lawn.

She also placed the location of VIRGINIA DAVIS,

her sister, whose actions were essentially the same as

those of BARBARA DAVIS, although VIRGINIA did not view

the man crossing the lawn.

D. Police Lineup and Identification

Davis recognized suspect "#2". She stated that

the lineup was composed of four white males of

approximately the same height.

No more specific

information concerning the lineup and its procedure

was elicited by the Commission.

The lineup took place a little after 8:00

p.m. on Friday, 11/22.

Also present was her sister,

who made an identification at the same time.

really delve into these matters with DAVIS, who must

be seen as a crucial mitness.

Tippit Murder

Witness: HELEN LOUISE MARKHAM

3 H 305

7 H 499

I. WARREN REPORT

A. Personal Information

MARKHAM possessed

an eighth grade education, and

was a waitress in Dallas. A life-long Dallas resident.

She was very nervous at her interview by the

Commission and bordered on incoherence.

Her perception

and credibility must be questioned severely.

B. Summary of References in Warren Report

MARKHAM saw a man leaning on an open window

of a police cruiser while she was walking down the street.

She viewed the officer and this man speaking rather calmly

and then saw Tippit slowly open the door on the driver's

side of the car.

At this point, the man fired three shots at the

officer.

MARKHAM was at all times extremely upset, and

bordered on hysteria, leaving her shoes on the top of

Tippit's squad car.

She was present at a 4:30 lineup

at which she identified Oswald at the killer.

She later had a telephone conversation with

MARK LANE, which she denied. The Commission did not view

this adversely, although it pointed out the fact.

---

## Page 130

II. TESTIMONY BEFORE THE WARREN COMMISSION

A. Description of Actions and Locations

MARKHAM'S testimony was confused and unclear.

She stated nothing in testimony which was not included

in the REPORT, which indicates the reliance of the

Commission on MARKHAM.

The only divergent testimony was that TIPPIT

attempted to speak to MARKHAM after he had been shot,

although other testimony was that Tippit died instantly.

She also clarifed that Tippit was shot as he

reached the left front wheel of the squad car.

Her testimony was quite abbreviated before the

Commission and she was in the beginning asked to remain

calm.

B. Description of Lee Harvey Oswald

MARKHAM described Oswald as being about 30 years

of age, slender, and with black hair.

In a lter telephone conversation with MARK LANE,

she gave a different description, describing the

suspect as short and sticky and having "bushy"

hair.

contradictory, and was clearly terminated by

the Commission because of its incoherence and its

lack of probative value.

Despite this, the REPORT relied heavily upon

her statements.

Despite her constant denials that she spoke to

MARK LANE, it is clear that she did, and that she

gave different information to him than to the Commission.

at 2 H 51.

Tippit Murder

Witness:

N. M. McDONALD

3 H 309

I. WARREN REPORT

A. Personal Information

McDonald was a

radio patrolman for eight

years on the Dallas Police force. He knew Tippit

quite well both

personally and as a fellow officer.

With McDonald on the day of the assassination

T.C. GREGORY, who was a trainee. It was customary

(indeed, this applied to 80% of the police force) that

patrolmen rode alone unless participating in a training

session, which was shy he was accompanied, and why, for

example, Tippit was not on November 22.

B. Summary of References in Warren Report

McDonald is the major actor in the capture of Oswald

at the Texas Theater.

He is thus mentioned prominently

in the pages of the REPORT concerning these matters.

Of note is the reference in the REPORT that

McDonald searched two men before approaching

Oswald in the theater, although he knew that oswald

was the suspect.

The REPORT continues, giving a rather lengthy

discussion of the fist fight which Oswald and McDonald

engaged in after McDonald approached him. The

REPORT also notes

that McDonald heard Oswald state

"It's all over now," or words to that effect.

---

## Page 134

II. TESTIMONY BEFORE THE WARREN COMMISSION

A. Description of Actions and Locations

McDonald went on his own initiative to the scene

in order to aid officers involved in the Tippit murder.

He was not directed to that location by the police dispatcher

He searched the Public Library at Marsalis and

Jefferson after hearing that a suspect had been seen

in that location.

After that proved negative, he proceded

to the Texas Theater after hearing that a suspect was

in the vicinity.

He went into the theater and stood on the

stage with the house lights on. He approached

two

men sitting in the front of the theater before

going toward Oswald. He heard Oswald say something

net other descent joined him in subut with

the suspect.

McDonald put his mark on the gun which was

found on Oswald's person at the time.

approximately 27 years old, 5' 10", weighing 145,

and wearing a white shirt.

III. COMPARISONS AND CONCLUSIONS

never interviewed.

Tippit Murder

Witness: WILLIAM SCOGGINS

3 H 322

I. WARREN REPORT

A. Personal Information

At the time of his testimony, SCOGGINS was

49 years old and employed as a cab driver in Dallas.

He did not grow up in Dallas, but had lived in several

areas of the country.

B. Summary of References in Warren Report

See pp. : 7, 165, 169, 175, 651.

SCOGGINS viewed Oswald passing within 12'

of his taxicab after the fatal shots had been

fired.

He did not actually see the shots, but only

saw the escape.

As Oswald passed, SCOGGINS heard

the man say "Poor dumb cop," or words to that

effect.

SCOGGINS took place in a lineup identification

on Saturday sometime after noon.

Before taking part

in this lineup, he had seen a picture of Oswald

in the newspaper.

---

## Page 138

II. TESTIMONY BEFORE THE WARREN COMMISSION

A. Description of Actions and Locations

SCOGGINS testified that he had stopped his cab

at the curb on Tenth Street and was having lunch after

having purchased a soda from a nearby store.

He had

eaten two bites of his sandwich, and believed the time

to be 1:20.

At this time, he saw a police car cruising about

10-12 miles per hour

along the street. He paid no more

attention until he heard 3 or 4 gunshots, at which time

he looked down the street. He did not actually see the

shooting of Tippit. He immediately called the cab

dispatcher to report the shooting and requested that

an ambulance be sent to aid Tippit.

He then saw Oswald

leaving the scene, with a gun in his hand, running

at "a kind of a trot."

SCOGGINS got out of his cab and hid behind it

until the gunman had passed, thinking from stories

which he had heard, that the gunman might attempt to

commandeer his cab in an attempt to escape.

After Oswald had passed, SCOGGINS went to aid

Tippit, who had apparently expired by this time. In

addition, an ambulance had arrived, apparently from

SCOGGINS ' call, by the time he arrived near Tippit.

According to SCOGGINS, Tippit's revolver lay in the

street, although it was clear to him that Tippit

"never got to his gun."

At this point, CALLAWAY approached SCOGGINS

and persuaded him to drive his cab in an attempt to

locate the gunman.

SCOGGINS agreed and the two drove

around the neighborhood in an attempt to find the suspect.

The path which they took is described in the summary of

the testimony of CALLAWAY.

## Page 139

B. Description of Lee Harvey Oswald

SCOGGINS described the suspect as of medium

height and slender, aged 25-26.

C. Placement of Other Witnesses

Ted CALLAWAY (see Callaway summary)

D. Police Lineup and Identification

SCOGGINS was present at a lineup held on Saturday

November 23 at approximately noon.

There were four men in the lineup: two were of

roughly the same height as Oswald and two

were some

degree shorter. SCOGGINS did not indicate that the

lineup was suggestive in this sense, and he picked

Oswald quickly from thislineup.

SCOGGINS had seen a picture of Oswald in the

newspaper before being present at the lineup.

Later, however, SCOGGINS was shown four or five

picture by the FBI and

asked to pick Oswald from

these photos.

He could only narrow the decision to

two of the photos shown him, and when forced to choose

one of the men, did not choose Oswald.

Present with SCOGGINS at the lineup was

cab driver William WHALEY, who described the lineup as

suggestive.

identified

It was his conclusion that anyone could have

Oswald, since he had an argument with police

officers at the time, ans since he varied substantially

from

the other men.

In addition, Oswald was forced to

give his real name and place of employment, while the

other men simply gave fictitious names, addresses,

and places of employment.

E. Crucial Documents

SCOGGINS AND TIPPIT.

III. COMPARISONS AND CONCLUSIONS

SCOGGINS seemed to be a reliable witness, at

least to a much greater extent than many of the

other witnesses in the Tippit murder.

There are problems, however, with his

identifications, since he was not able to pick Oswald

from a group of

photographs and since the lineup

apparently was flawed.

Further information is needed

concerning both the lineup and the later showup, since

SCOGGINS and his identification was relied upon

heavily

by the Commission.

Indeed, the only other witness to

the actual shooting was HELEN MARKHAM, whose

testimony appears

inherently unreliable.

Given that

SCOGGINS' identifications also face problems of

reliability, this seriously weakens the case against

Oswald re: Tippit.

they have continually eluded the investigations to which they

nave been subject throughout the 1960's and which continue

presently.

MCWILLIE, LEWIS J.: was a pitboss, first in the Tropicana

Casino,

ten in the

Riviera Casino, in

Havana in the late 1950's and

early 1960's. His associates, according to FBI reports,

included Meyer and Jake Lansky, Santos Trafficante, Dino

Cellini and Benny Binion. McWillie was a very close friend

of Jack Ruby. The two were purportedly involved in a number

of smuggling and gun running operations in Cuba, Las Vegas

and elsewhere.

PANITZ, MEYER: was associated with Jack Ruby and Lewis McWillie.

FBI reports indicate that in the summer of 1959 McWillie

called Panitz in Miami Beach from Havana to say that Ruby

Mew 2110

had just visited him in Havana and that Ruby was now proce-

ding to Miami Beach. Another report indicates that "Panitz

contacted Ruby at Wolfies Restaurant, 21 Sheet and Collins,

Miami Beach, Florida."

In 1963, Panitz worked as a box man

at the Thunderbird Casino where McWillie was also working.

PATRICK, LENNY: like Dave Yaras, was a Mafia assassin and a long-

time friend of Jack Ruby. He, along with Yaras, was mentioned

in the Warren Commission testimony of Ruby's sister, Eva Grant.

ROTHMAN, NORMAN "ROUGHHOUSE": was

a Chicago gangster who used to

to work for Santos Trafficante in Trafficante's San Souci

Casino. He was, according to certain reports, the original

liaison between the Mafia and the CIA in their mutual efforts

to assassinate Fidel Castro. It has been reported that Rothman

offered a contract on Castro to Frank Sturgis while he was

acting as Castro's conduit with the casinos in Havena. Sturgis

has denied the allegation. Later, Rothman reportedly worked

with John Roselli on the CIA-Mafia assassination plots.

Rothman ran guns to pro-Castro forces in 1958; then later

ran guns to pro-Batista forces. In 1960, he was indicted for

interstate transportation of stolen firearms.

Rothman

is currently in Haiti with Michael McLaney at one of

McLaney's nightclubs.

SHIMON, JOSEPH: In September, 1975 Joseph Simon testified before

the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations

with respect to Intelligence Activities.

Shimon stated that

accompanied Sam Giancana and John Roselli to Miami. He stated

that he had been present when CIA officials passed poisen

pills to Roselli

and

Giancana for use in assassinating Castro.

Shimon also indicated to the Committee that Robert Maheu

told him that John

Poselli was handling all of the

details

of the Castro assassination attempts, that it was "Johnny's

contract."

Shimon also stated that Giancana had told him that

Liahau's involvement in the CIA-Mafia efforts was self-serving,

that he was, in fact, "conning the hell out of the CIA."

Shimon is currently living in the Washington, D.C. area.

TRAFFICANTE, SANTOS: was and is a powerful Mafia leader whose

personal empire includes most of Florida and whose case of

operations is Tampa. From late 1960 until late 1962, Traffi-

cante served as organized crime coordinator of the CIA-Mafia

conspiracies to assassinate Fidel Castro. The report of the

Senate Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations with

respect to Intelligence Activities states that in September

or October of 1960,

"Roselli introduced Maheu to two individuals

on whom Roselli intended to rely: 'Sam Gola'

who would serve

'back-up'

man, or 'key

man,' and

'Joe,' who 'Gold' said would serve

as a courier to Cuba and make arrangements

there."

The Senate Committee further stated that "Sam Gold" was Sam

Giancana and that "Joe" was Santos Trafficante.

In 1976 a reporter with connections in Miami's Cuban exile

community reported that Jose Aleman,..an influential anti-

Castroite, stated that Trafficante told him,

a Septembar

1962 meeting that Kennedy was "going to be hit."

Trafficante has appeared before

the House Select Committee

on Assassinations where he declined to answer questions

relating to his involvement in the Castro assassination plots

or to his alleged

fore-knowledge of the Kennedy assassination.

WEINER, IRWIN: was, in 1963, a Chicago bail bondsman with alleged

ties to organized crime. The Warren Commission's investigation

of Jack Ruby's telephone calls revealed a 12-minute call

from Weiner to Ruby on October 26, 1963. In 1975 Weiner was

charged with fraud in connection with the Teamsters pension-

fund case

but was acquitted.He is presently in the Chicago area.

YARAS, DAVE: was a Mafia assassin who had a long association with

Jack Ruby. The relationship came to the attention of the

Warren Commission initially through the testimony of Ruby's

sister, Eva Grant. The FBI questioned Yaras, who confirmed

his friendship with Ruby as well as that with Lenny Patrick.

However,

the FBI did

not question Yaras on his own Mafia

activities and accepted deadpan yaras' statement that he

doubted that Ruby had any Mafia connections.

The McClellan Senate Committee investigation of organized

crime heard testimony indicating that Yaras had been involved

in the establishment of the Mafia's gambling operations in

Havana and

that he had been involved with the corrupt Teamsters

Local 320 in Miami.

Y'aras is currently living in the Miami area.

CRIMALDI, CHARLES: was a Mafia hit man who testified at the trial

of

Tony Esposito, where he detailed Mafia actirities in

Chicago. Crimaldi is currently working for the FBI. Crimaldi

states that he was present at the Mafia's "funeral meeting"

at which Paul Ricca ordered members of the Chicago Syndicate

not to get involved in the Castro assassinatio= plot business.

Crimaldi states that he was once approached by the Central

Intelligence Agency and offered employment as a contract

killer in Europe. Crimaldi has spoken witti omiers of the

Select Committee on Assassinations staff. He has described

CIA involvement with organized crime and has stated that,

to his knowledge, Jimmy Hoffa worked with Sam Giancana to

plan the assassination of Fidel Castro. He does not believe,

nowever, that Hoffa was involved in the Kennedy assassination.

Crimaldi speculated as to the cause of Charles Nicoletti's

death, feeling that it was linked to Nicoletti's knowledge

of CIA-Mafia assassination plots. However, he stated that

he had no knowledge of Nicoletti's involvement in or knowledge

of, the Kennedy assassination.
