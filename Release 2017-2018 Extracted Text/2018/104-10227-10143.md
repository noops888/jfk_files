MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT 1 Meoting in Mr. Coorr's office, 1100-1230, 13 Oct 63

PAKTICIPANTS: Messrs. Coerr, Wollam, Hurwiteh,
Colonel Johnson

1, Colone! Johnson gave o full account of his two meetings with
Dr.-MIRO in Miami on 5 and 6 Cctober, following in detail the Memo-
vada for the Record prepared by Colonel Johnson of these mectings.
He alo outlined the items Paula had givod las the budget for 1961
onthe basie of thoir receiving $100,000 for that month. That outline,
it was romarked, appears to be largely the same as tho old F RD budget.

All present felt that this budget appeared to be well-padded and.largely

for salaries, 2. wi remarked by Colone! Johnson that there seemed

to'bs a vory. good possibility that come of those on the salary Mat may

aleo, be receiving support from HEW, Colones] Johnson remarked that

he would be seeing. Dr, MIRO on Monday, 16 October, at which time

he expects to clarify some of the budget mattore and also to got from ‘
CIA's Miami station sore more details from bir. Paula, ;

2. Mr, Coerr raised the question of what was the cover to bo iE
used by Colonel Johnson fn his contacts with Dr, MIRO. Colonel Johnson
said that the cover question had not yet been regolved, that it was
questionable how long any cover would hold up, particularly with the
press, that the cover of public relations consultant, the cover of a
research man or teacher in Miami, and various other possibilities were
under considerstion, Mr, Coorr commented that the astute presse rep-
Fosontatives might soon learn the identity of the CIA representative
with MIRO, particularly if opposition leadere like PRIG, who, he re-
marked, already seems to know, should become angry and report in
the press what they know. Mr, Hurwitch stated that MIRC had told him
that PRIO, cr a representative of PRIC, had saidto MIRC, "I under-
etand that you have a Colonel Johnson as your representative with the
U. S. Government." MIRO also declared to Mir, Hurwitch that only
he, MIRO, and his secretary, ARAGON, had.reason to know of
Colonel Johnson's role. There was some speculation on how PRIO had

learned of the matter. +



3. Mr, paid that there was need to, clarify just who
Colonel! Johnson represented to Dr, MIRO, that \:IRO had been told
he would have a represontative who would havo {requent contact with
Mr, Goodwin in the White House and Mr, Voodward and others at
the Department of State and would also be in contact with the Agency,
and that it was accordingly the understanding of the Agency that
Colenel. Johnson would therefore represent or be the link between
Dr. MIRO and the U. S, Government, at least in the Miami-area.

He romarked that this certainly had some bearing on the cover mattor
and ite security aspects. Mr, Coerr remarked that it seemed
Colonel Johnson was simply an overt representative of the Agency.
Mg. remarked that this waa hardly possible and otill havo
any security or deniability, If he was overt, he was automatically

A representative of the U. S. Government. Mr. Hurwitch interposed

* that ho considered Colonal Johnson to be solely the representative of

the Agency. He said that Mr, Goodwin had said that he, Goodwin,
only wanted to be Consulted on the moet important feoues and that MIRO's
normal contact in Washington for policy guidance should be with the
Cuban dosk in the Department of State. In Miami, Colone! Johnson
would thea work out with MIRO the Agency support of theso policies.

4. Mr, Hurwitch continued, expressing his view that
Colonel Johneoi should have the authority from the Agency to discuss
and approve Dr. MIRO's operational plane ouch ao tours to Latin
America, support of internal grwups and the lke and, if certain plano
wore approvod by them, to sit down with MIRC, the military advisors
and reprosentatives of the intornal groups, and work out final details
for actually running operations in support of theae elements,
Mr. jcountered, -"It ie by no means as simple as that. This
is a lot more complicated than just having two or a dosen people sit
down in Miami and agree on something. Take, for instance, the .
simple matter, relatively speaking, of sending to Latin America a
person on a speaking tour. Did you know that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and tho FBI require all requests for support
from them to be sent back here to Washington and then their people.
in Miami have to be instructed by their Headquarters here in Washing-
ton to facilitate such travel, thus, in effect, the final control on travel
je up here in Washington and it doesn't oven reside in the Agency.
Each individual hag to be so handled." Mr, Hurwitch said be thought
that thie could be worked out so that it could be done entirely locally
in Miami, Mr expressed some doubt and said that somehow



i

he had the improsoion that MIRO had Mttle-assets but thought that
if ho could acquire all the facilities of CIA as a sovernmont ontity
placed at his disposal, he-could do something. Of course these
facilities and the authority of CLA simply could not be turned over to

Dr, MIKO,

5.. Colonel Johnaon sald that he felt there was a considerable
area in which we could support Dr. MIRC and he. referred to the
Stato Department's propaganda plan, “Cperacion Grieta, " which
Dr. MIRO said he bad received during his visit to Mr. Hurwitch and
Mr, Morales Carrion. Mr, Hurwitch explained that this waa in no
senso a Dopartment of State plan but rather a suggested draft by
Morales Carrion and passed to MIRO ao merely an indication of the
‘sort of propaganda operation in Latin America that might be effective.

6. On the subject of propaganda and the activities of the
“collateral groups" like the FORD, the DRE, atc, outaide the CRC,
both Mr. Wollam and Mr, Hurwitch said they believed it wou!d be
possible to transfer theee groups and their activities in their entirety °
to Dr, MIRO in accordance with his desires. br, said
he eympathized with MIRC's position but doubted that It would work,
d4r, Hurwitch sald that if. we had some doubts on thie matter, he won-
dered.why theas doubts had not been brought up by Mr. Bissell in the-
discussions with Mr. Goodwin. Mr, Hurwitch then claimed he hada
Goodwin memo saying tho DRE, FORD, and all internal groups must
be financed through MIRO, - Mr, ‘Hurwitch woadered when this new
position had developed in the Agency. Mr, stated that tho
Agency had had long experience during the past tuo years in dealing
with the various Cuban elements both in and outside Cuba, and that
thead types of probleme had existed {rom the beginning and although
they may seem new to Mr. Hurwitch and Mr. Wollam, who had recent-
ly come on the desk, thoy certainly were not new to Nir. Coerr, who
readily agreed. Mr. inted out that, in the early stages of
1960, attempts were made to form some sort of coalition of the
miscellaneous Cuban groups. Finally the FRD was born and much.
later the CRC, responsibility for wich was thén transferred to the
White House and the State Department after the invasion. In the first
or early stages mentioned, relatively little had come of our attempts
to genorate meaningfw activities through Cuban-controlled channels
euch og tho FRD, that the Agency, to achieve any real degree of success
{n developing propaganda and other activities against Castro, had to
form miscellaneous groups, political and collateral, and then try to



shove them one way or the other under the umbrella of the FRD.

He pointed out that the most telling criticls:n made by the prees and

by members of the State Department, too, at that time was that

we were forcing thoge various groups through monetary control into
Joining the FRD, -He stated further that this had been discussed in aa
Baltimore. last month in détail with Dr, MIRO, who Bt that time

seemed to agro that 1f-D¥, MIRO and the CRC were to oucceed in
ontroiling the other groupa, both collateral and political, it ideally

* should be by leadership rather than by oxercising financial control.

% Mr,| then brought up the quastion of Just how far
should we go in support of MIRO and the Council, and how are we going
to justify some of these expe: Considorable discussion followed,
at the conclusion of which M: | mont! he would like to throw out
onthe table some specific po! Mmply ae an indication of some.of ...
the problom areas which he felt had been at least touched upon by tho
discussion and te which in the coming weeks some consideration would’
have to be given, although certainly this meoting should not try to
arrive atany definitive answors;

a. Wohould be clarified whether-or not, in fact, some of
those persone listed as receiving salaries from a FRD are also re-
ceiving economie aid from the HEW,

b. Bt should bo noted that Dr, MIRO's requeet’te engage in
activities are sometimes very unrealistic. For example, at one point
Dr, MIRO wanted to take over the Swan Island operation and wanted
to put up a $2, 000, 000 radio atation at Key West to beam propaganda
to Cuba and‘aleo to Jam Cuban broadceoto.

ec. The proposal to have round table discussions including
Dr. MIRO, his military. commisoion, and representatives of the internal
groups te decide on sabotage and commando-type raids is rather une
realistic for a variety of reasons, including security factora and the
question of whether or not this would be acceptable to any or all of

ied internal groups.

da De, MIRO has apparently the idoa that he can use his
million dollars for whatever be desires with little or no advance ap-
proval, and above this figure he may ask for unlimited funde for
operations. This certainly needs clearing up.

o. Dr. MIRG hao requooted that the /goncy turn over to
hi:n the funda, the control of the bank accounts, and the entire
mechaniom for making the “dependent paymento.” This {a a rather
hey item related to past history. Mr,|___| tated it wae hio
personal opinion that thie should not under any circumstances be
turned over to the CRC to administer independently. f

f° Relative to MIRO's request for aid to tho Escambray -

resistance group, Mr. ptated that ke had discussed this :
matter very thoroughly with Dr, MIRO, and it appeared from that |

convoreation that MIKO had had only one indirect contact with this |
group. Dr. MIRO had merely a pleco of paper signed by RAMIREZ.

and several othore allogedly in the Eacambray, stating that there |

were some 30 of thom in desperate straita and in need of oupport and
that, {f weapons were givon to them, thoy could muster 100,

Dr, MIRO was at that point not even sure how the paper had got to i
him and had.no'means whatsoover of communicating with RAMIREZ, |
He proposed the uae of a boat'te get the supplies to the North const -
of Cuba, but had.no idoa ow to get thom from the North const to the
Zacambzay, Aa an alternative, ho guggested an alr drop by a plano

from Florida.

. g: With regard to.the finarclal ald that MIRO had epohea
to both Mr. Hurwitch and Colonel Johnson about, f.e., the $70, 000
monthly to be sent into Cuba via the Medeor
pointed out that tho) when contacted by an Agency
repragentativo, etated that he, for tho time being, did not want his
Ernbasoy utilized further in thia type of transaction, that of the $70, 000

given MIRO, apparently only $40,000 was sent into thd He ee
and, of this, a large portion went for the needs of parsona in asylum

in the Embasoy rather than for-aupport of Cuban intornsl resistance
elements outeide the Embassy. In at least one instance, the Agency,
through separate channels, had, in fact, arranged to send funds to

the principal intornal group. which wi pposed to have recelved--

but didn't--a portion of the $49,000, Certdinly wo could not give
further support to thie activity without a good deal of clarification cf
exactly how future funds were to be sent in by Dr. MIRO.

8. Mr. Hurwitch then said that, with regard to Dr. MIRO's pro-
posal for the Council to establish itself on Cuban soil via a commando
operation and then got U. S, military support, this had been brought up

are

i
‘


SECRET

repeatedly with Mr. Goodwin, and Dr. MIRO had been told flatly not
to count on a U. S, military operation against Cuba, Mr, Hurwitch ”
said that MIRC now seems to be making the same proposal again
through Colonel Johnson, and that he should be discouraged from
making any plans for such an operation,

9. Mr. Hurwitch said that he batieved something could be done
for the three Cuban residents of the U. S. who had fought at Playa
Giron, but who now couldn't get aid through the Hefugee Council or
Social Security. Ho offered to take care of any such matters with HEW,
Accordingly, the names and data were left with Mr. Wollam for
Mr, Hurwitch'’s use. Mr, Hurwitch added that Mr. Wise at the
Refugee Conter in Miam{ might be a good contact if CLA wanted to
handle these matters iteelf in Miami,
