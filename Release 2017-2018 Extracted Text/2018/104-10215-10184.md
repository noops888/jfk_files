An MHAPRON target and old friend of Roalndo CUBELA (more
commonly known as AMLASH/1). CASTELL was reportedly
with the Cuban Security Department and is a cousin of
Ramiro Valdes, the Interior Minister. CASTELL is anti-
regime and CUBELA believes that he will "fall in line” if
there is a successful coup.

2. Cubela, as you know, has frequently expressed his desire to

| Kill Fidel Castro, infact, some’ officers in WH/SA, believe thet if t
anyone would attempt such a fete it would be Cubela, Cubela's concern, A
i however, seems to be one of assurance and certainly not cowardness, He an |
a wants U. S. assurance of innediate intervention should he be successful :
in disposing of Castro and other leaders, Perhaps this is the "personal u
Safety" JINJAUMA refers to in his letter to Zarraga.

3. The presence of two bodyguards in this eroup indicates the
accessability to their target, a significant factor in a plot of this
type, especially since Castro is 80 cbsely guarded.

4. F: > At ta not extraordinary that JINJAUMA should direct his
letter to a menber, nanely Zarraga, In his talks with Nestor
Sanchez, Cubela has clearly stated that of all the exile leaders in the
United States, he considera Manuel Ray as the only person who would be
permitted to return to Cuba, if Cubela is successful in a coup against
Castro. Cubela realizes, of course, that Ray is not a politician nor
& good organizer, but as an engineer, Ray has the qualities that would
be extrenely useful in Cuba's reconstruction.

5+ If you desire to have this inforsation sent to Mr. Céinnins,
we would like to include a few questions on Zarraga 3 Vig his knowledge of
several individuals mentioned, on whom there is obscure information.

Addendum: Marceline ARTIME Vega

ARTIME has been a cutout between Cubela and ‘Tepedine (aseHIP).
like Tepedino, ARTI® is a jewlen in Havana: Learning that
ARTINE is closely tied in with Cubela and Tepedine supports
the belief that the group is tightly knit.

I have learned too, that the information we have received
regarding a possible assassination of Fidel Castro has;
in nearly every case, originated from a member of this
group, which again indicates that this group is united

and they each understand that one miscue will destroy
all of them,
