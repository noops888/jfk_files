Tadeus? SZULO

(4)316)

The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have

been destroyed:

I attach, however, a menorandun consisting of

selected entries from his card.

2a.

• All the information is from the same source, a Polish emigre

who knew SZULC personally and also had informants in the Polish Embassy.

3.

There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-communist at the time,

and that he cooperated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed

by the Press Section of the Polish Embassy, and provided him with

"Information".: It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion

that this collaboration took the forn of espionage, since SZUiCe does

i not seem to have made any secret of the relationship.

, in Fat"

40...

I can find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence

officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist. He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,

stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs®
