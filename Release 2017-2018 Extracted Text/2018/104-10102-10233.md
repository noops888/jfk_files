The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have
been destroyed, I attdch, however, a memorandum consisting of

hes

selected entries fron his card,

2 All ‘the information ds from the seme source, a Polish emigre

“who knew SZULC personally ani also had, informants in the Polish Embassy,
“3. | There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-communist at the time,

and that he. co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed
‘by the Press Section of the Polish Embassy, and provided him with
"information". , It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion
that: this collaboration took the fons of espionage, since SZULCs does

not to have made any secret of the relationship.

I can find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an Antelagence

officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist, He returned
to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,

stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs.
