MEMORANDUM FOR MEMBERS OF SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

AND DESIGNEES

Schedule for Consideration

of Assassination Report

October 21, 1975

Annexed hereto is

a copy of the transcript of this after-

noon's Committee session at which agreement was reached concern-

ing how to proceed with the draft Assassination Report. In

summary, it was agreed as follows:

(1) Consideration of the Report is to be divided

into two pieces: (i) the sections related to the particular

plots in the particular countries and to executive action

(Section III) (these were referred to as the "text"

sections in the session this afternoon), and (ii) Chapters

I, II, IV and V (i.e., the Introduction and Summary, the

section on Covert Action, the Findings and Conclusions,

and the Recommendations).

(2) With respect to the "text" or countries/plots

sections, proposed changes are to be submitted to the under-

signed by the end of this week, or at the latest by Monday

afternoon.

Staff is instructed to attempt to work out an

agreed-upon treatment of such proposals with the subcommittee

## Page 5

- 2-

to be the final judge. It is expected that if any Senator

does not like the result of the treatment of such proposals,

it could be covered in separate views.

(3) With respect to the other sections,

a plenary

session of the Committee will be held commencing Wednesday,

October 29, for the purpose of considering any proposed

written amendments. Any such proposed amendments should

be submitted to [the undersigned] by the end of the day

Monday so as to permit the staff to organize and analyze

the proposals.

We will send you shortly a schedule indicating the

staff members who are particularly knowledgeable about the

various chapters in the text or countries/plots sections.

These persons are available for questions or other assistance.

available in the full book for the Committee.

Then tomorrow we have hearings in the morning and in the

afternoon as well because of Helms. So, the Full Committee shoul

take this up Thursday. We will be free Thursday afternoon.

Mr. Miller. Yes.

The Chairman. For this purpose?

All right, why do we not begin the Full Committee's

consideration on Thursday afternoon?

Senator Hart (Colorado). Mr. Chairman, are you seeking

opinions on how to proceed?

The Chairman. Yes.

Senator Hart (Colorado). What if we had an agenda of

controversial items; that is to say, there is either division

at the staff or Subcommittee level, and just attack it that way?

The Chairman. I think as far as the Subcommittee is

concerned, when we complete our work, we will not have any

divisions.

Senator Hart (Colorado). All right. Or flagging.

The Chairman. We have some things to flag, yes, some

things to flag which we can --

Senator Hart (Colorado). And then leave it to individual

members to flag anything else.

The Chairman. The Subcommittee will be united on its

report, and the staff is united on the report.

Senator Hart (Colorado). That is what I meant with flag.

The Chairman. We could flag certain things which we think

ought to be called to the special attention of the Full Committee.

I would be glad to do that.

Senator Hart. (Colorado) • And presume everything else is

non-controversial unless some individual Senator on the Full

Committee raises it.

The Chairman. Mr. Lombard?

Mr. Lombard. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I could suggest

this from the staff point of view. If the Senators might not

have three or four days to read the document themselves -- now,

as you

recall, it was not ready prior to the adjournment, and

the mechanics of getting it together were just too much -- I

think this might move along a lot more quickly if we allowed a

few days for each Senator and designee to read the entire

report, on the textual part. I am not talking about the

findings and recommendations; and to submit within that period

any suggested changes, and then have a plenary session of the

Committee on the findings and recommendations.

The Chairman. Let me see, Mr. Lombard, if I understand

you correctly, that suggestions with respect to the change in

the textual part --

Mr. Lombard. Would be made during the reading period.

The Chairman.

Would be made during the reading period.

Mr. Lombard. And incorporated, if possible.

The Chairman. And incorporated if possible.

Mr. Lombard. Right.

The Chairman. And then when we hold the plenary sessions

we confine them to the findings and recommendations and the

summary findings.

Mr. Lombard. Yes, sir. Because it's my opinion that if

we have additional views, not only dissenting views, and if

I sense what is going along here, I think that we are very close

to achieving unanimity, with the understanding that there may

be additional views, if we try to go through this thing section

by section, having known the Senators for a number of years --

this should not be taken amiss -- but we will never get there.

The Chairman. We will never get there.

Mr. Lombard. So what I would like to suggest is that we

permit the report to lie on the table, so to speak, for four

or five days so that the reading and objections to the actual

cases could be made, and I do not think there will be many of

those. I do not think you will get much of that. And then

have a meeting on the findings and recommendations, and at

that time the Senators could voice objections or amendments to

the findings and conclusions.

The Chairman. What do you have to say about that, Mr.

Schwarz?

Mr. Schwarz. Suppose as a suggestion additionally to that,

that there be a day certain for having amendments in writing,

which will give a little time to focus on them, not just have them

come out on the table.

Mr. Lombard. I am not suggesting what time, but I am talk-

ing about a two step process so that we have a reading process,

and then that we would have suggestions on the cases, and then

later we would go to the findings and recommendations.

The Chairman. It may be that your suggestion, Mr. Lombard,

would save us time, and I think we now ought to strive to save..

as much time as possible, but it would have to be agreeable

to the members that we proceed this way, and if we give this

additional time, I think that along with any suggested changes

in the general text, members should prepare such amendments as

they might wish to make to the findings, and then the plenary

session could be confined.

Mr. Lombard. You have said it better than I said it.

The Chairman. I am following you.

We'll have to settle on the dates also.

Mr. Lombard. It seems to me that, in other words, if

we would set next Wednesday for our plenary; session, which

would be for the purpose of going over the findings and recom-

mendations and approving the report on that date -- well, if

possible, and then we would have the three days following this

for the filing of additional reports, so that could really

be done by Friday, the whole thing wrapped up.

The Chairman. Well, if you think that that is the most

expeditious way to move -- Mike?

Mr. Madigan. I would just want to say that if any dates

are going to be set, it would be the middle of next week

because Senator Baker's wife's grandmother died, and he's

not going to be able to be back here until late Thursday.

It is a personal problem.

Mr. Lombard. If'we do want to work on this individually

rather than as a group, it is going to go fast.

The Chairman. Well, how does it strike the Committee,

this proposal?

Senator Mondale. It's the Chairman's choice.

The Chairman. All right. The only problem that I see

with it is that if we delay it for another week, when we do

go into the plenary session, we've got to go in prepared and

the Committee has to be satisfied to confine the plenary

sessions to the findings, the recommendations, and the summary

of the findings in order to get our work done. And insofar as

possible, the staff will incorporate suggestions by individual

members as they relate to the text.

Mr. Lombard. The individual Senator, if he's not

satisfied, can always put in additional views.

The Chairman. And the staff should cooperate with

the individual suggestions made with respect to possible

revisions in the text itself.

Mr. Lombard. Mr. Chairman, one further thing. Can

we have an assumption here that the section on Bobby Kennedy

is in fact going to be nailed down?

The Chairman. Oh, yes, we're going to nail that down

today, the section on Bobby Kennedy. So that will be available

to the members to handle. We've been trying to nail that down

for a long time.

Mr. Lombard. It is a steady wicket.

The Chairman. All right, then, if we can get Senator

Tower after this vote --

Mr. Kirbow. Senator, he was going to move this same type

of lay-it-on-the-table motion. I'm sure he'll agree with that.

We'll try to have him here.

Mr. Schwarz. Does the proposal contemplate having the

amendments available before the session Wednesday?

Otherwise

the session Wednesday is going to be terribly disorganized.

Mr. Lombard. Yes.

The Chairman. They will: have to be available.

Mr. Lombard. But we are confining the amendment process

to the findings and recommendations.

Mr. Schwarz. The other is more 'informal.

Mr. Lombard. It doesn't come up..at the plenary session

on Wednesday. If you have any kicks about the evidentiary

report, they should be submitted to staff, and if they're not

incorporated and you don't. like it, you put it in your additional

views.

Otherwise, you're going to nitpick about a lot of

things.

The Chairman. I think, Mr. Lombard, that's an

excellent suggestion.

Mr. Maxwell. What we should do is fix a time then,: if

people who are going to provide for evidentiary changes, say

either by the end of this week or by Tuesday morning.

Mr. Schwarz. It's awfully late, Tuesday morning.

Senator Huddleston. How about Monday?

The Chairman. Let me make this suggestion. Let's be

sure that all members are informed that this is the Committee's

decision and not just the Chairman's choice.

First, beginning now, any suggested changes in the text

relating to the different cases in Section 3 of the report,

should be submitted to the staff of the Committee for possible

incorporation in that section of the report. The drafting

subcommittee should be the final judge of what goes in or

doesn't go in, or the form in which it goes in of the text.

Then if a Senator is dissatisfied with that decision,

he is always free to express his own view of that particular

point in his supplementary views.

Mr. Lombard. Well, then it will also gain a lot more

signatures.

The Chairman. Now the suggestions that members wish to

make with respect to Section 3 and possible changes, should .

come. to the general counsel, Fritz, and to Charley.

Mr. Schwarz. At my 10023 mailing address?

The Chairman. And they should be made as quickly as

possible and they should be in.

Mr. Schwarz. But just as soon as possible because we're

in the process of doing the same thing on looking for style

problems and clarity.

The Chairman. Yes, we're trying to finalize this, so

those suggestions, I think, should be in by the end of the week.

Senator Schweiker. Which section are we talking about?

The Chairman. We're talking about Section 3, which is

just the rendition of what happened in the various cases.

Mr. Kirbow.

The plots themselves.

The Chairman. Those should be in by the end of the week.

Senator Schweiker. You mean part 3, Tab D? My table

doesn't even have a 3 on it.

Mr. Kirbow. It's under your Tab. --

The Chairman. The country by country cases where we

Mr. Kirbow. Tab D,E,F,G, and H should be the ones.

Senator Schweiker. We also get this from nomenclature.

The Chairman. Let those be submitted to Charley and

to Fritz for incorporation, and the. Subcommittee will be the

final judge on whether they will be incorporated and Senators

will be free if they're not satisfied with that decision to

incorporate their suggestion in supplementary views.

Then the plenary sessions will begin next Wednesday of

the Full Committee. The plenary sessions will be confined to

the summary, findings, and the recommendations, and any

suggested changes in any of those should be submitted to the

Full Committee for its consideration prior to next Wednesday.

Make it by the close of business Monday, so they can be

properly formulated by the staff and presented at the first

plenary session.

Mr. Lombard. But that would not rule out our amendment

on Wednesday if called up for a vote.

The Chairman. Not at all, but the plenary session will.

do. its work then.

Mr. Schwarz. The theory is you could see it in advance.

Mr. Lombard. This is normally done and something might.

happen, it would not preclude a Senator from exercising his

right to offer a formal amendment on Wednesday, even though

he hadn't notified the Committee.

The Chairman. No, we won't try and do that.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I intend in the

next 48 hours to make a rather strong statement on the floor

for the record on leaks, and it will be documented and it will -

be critical of the Administration and the agencies for pre-

empting this Committee, and I will circulate the text of that

before I make the statement to each member.

The Chairman. Thank you.

above-mentioned matter was concluded.)
