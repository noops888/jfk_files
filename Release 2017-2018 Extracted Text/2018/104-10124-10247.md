Section C

Mr. James Walton Moore is hereby nominated for a
Career Intelligence Medal in recognition of his substantial
contributions to the missions of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Office of Strategic Services, the
Strategic Services Unit and the Central Intelligence Agency
for more than 37 years.

J. Walton (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27,
1930-36) in Shantung Province, China with his missionary
parents. Following graduation from Hardin-Simmons University
in 1940, Jim joined the FBI and served as a Special Agent in
both Chicago and San Francisco. During the latter assign-
ment he reported on pro-Communist elements in Chinatown and
directed a US Government panel to interview aliens and US
citizens returning home to ensure that enemy agents were not
slipping into the US as refugees or foreign businessmen.

Jim joined OSS in November 1944 and was commissioned

as an Ensign, USNR. His first assignment was in Kunming
where he recruited and trained Chinese agents to infiltrate
Japanese lines, While in Kunming he took parachute training
and on August 17, 1945 jumped into the Japanese internment
camp at Weihsein. Following evacuation of refugees he
became Chief of Mission in Tsingtao. Returning to the US
Chief of Station) in Dairen. Soviet intransigence prevented

is reaching Dairen so he remained sGhict of. for an

1 n December 1946, he was reassigned as Vice Consul and
ue

additional year until transferred as \Chief of Station) in
Calcutta, arriving there in April, 1948. z7)

Jim returned to the United States in October 1949 and
joined the Contact Division, Office of Operations, CIA.
CD/00 policy favored continuity and Jim was no exception.
From 1949 to 1954 he served in the Houston Field Office and
from 1954-1972 as the Resident Officer in Dallas. The
Contact Division evolved into the Domestic Contact Service
and a reallocation of resources raised the Dallas Resident
Office to Field Office status. Jim was the obvious choice
for the job. After nine months training and preparation in
Washington (where he performed admirably) he was assigned
as Chief of the new office with responsibility also for
Resident Offices in Tulsa, Houston, New Orleans and, even-
tually, Austin.

Section C (continued)

Jim's work in Dallas has been consistently excellent.
Under his leadership the Dallas complex has provided timely
foreign intelligence in response to worldwide priorities
and requirements. As an example, in April 1975 the Acting
Director, Stratetic Research commended Jim for “outstanding
performance" for urgent special efforts to obtain information
which resulted ina reduction of over 500,000 in the
Intelligence Community's estimate of the total number of
Soviet military personnel.

. Similarly, the Dallas Office has provided excellent
support to the Clandestine Service. In November, 1976 the
Chief, FR Division commended Jim and his staff for "outstanding
support" from October 1975-October 1976 in efforts which
were "indispensable" to the establishment of FR assets in

‘Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in identifying and

assessing prospective targets for recruitment.

There are very few persons of potential consequence to
the Intelligence Community in Texas who Jim Moore does not
know and little that he cannot accomplish there on behalf
of Community and Agency requesters.

The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in
November 1963, the subsequent. allegations against CIA and
Jim Moore's long association with Agency interests and
programs in Texas have made him a repeated target for media
attention and scurrilous innuendo. Although under various
forms of severe external pressure as a result, Jim Moore
never lost his calm, cool demeanor and has been absolutely
dependable in adversity.

An experienced professional, a true gentleman, a delight-
ful person, and an example to be emulated, Jim Moore has
been a real credit to the intelligence profession. As he
approaches retirement, he richly deserves recognition in the
form of the Career Intelligence Medal.
