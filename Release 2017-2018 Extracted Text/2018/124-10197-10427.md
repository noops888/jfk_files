spent a month working out an alibi. (A)U)

"MORALES said he had been in contact with

FERNANDO PENABAZ, who told him all about his activities.

young Cuban exiles in Miami who were very anxious for

anti-CASTRO activities.

This group, called Secret Army,

use of arms or explosives and have had no anti-CASTRO

activities.

MORALES indicated he was not in unity with

this group. Ax
