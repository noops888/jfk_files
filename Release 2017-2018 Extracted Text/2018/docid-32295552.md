by getting him to lead an expedition against DR which

would be trapped by DR in which event reward might go as

get back "In" with persons behind plan, GARCIA indicated

he probably could.

FICKIE believed GARCIA intended to

get back "in"

through FONDEUR.

It would appear that since GARCIA has discussed

concerning matter of D'ALESSANDRO.

In view of above, Miami does not contemplate
