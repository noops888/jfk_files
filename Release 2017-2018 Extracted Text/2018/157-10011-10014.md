OCCURRENCE: Harvey was asked about notes written by hill andestiver, from their

meeting in January of 1961, concerning Executive Action.

One portion of the notes

stated, "Be within KUBARK, one focal point for control, search, training, case

officering, etc. -- GDP authority in this focal point mandatory. DCI officially

advised?" (57)

Harvey testified that he did not know whether the DCl was advised:

that he had been asked to create a capability for Executive Action and had taken

certain steps to have an assessment of assets in that connection. (57)

Harvey

clarified that the wording of the memo probably meant that consideration should be

given to the question of how, whether and under what circumstances the DCI should be

officially advised of his program, "I want to make it clear that this in no way

means he should be advised.

He should not be advised, he should never be advised,

he should always be advised." (59).
