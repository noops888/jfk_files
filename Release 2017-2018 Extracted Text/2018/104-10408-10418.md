WOFIR has been requested by an Australian newspaper

editor (Attachneut A) to release the Warren Commission Document

971- (CD 371 1s Attachment B) which relates to anonymous telephone,

(calls to the Canberra Embassy, at the tine of the assassination of

President Kennedy.

Els request was turned down.

As you probably

know, there has been mounting public pressure to release classified

documents of the Warren Connission.

While no decision has been

made to declassify CD 972, it is highly possible we will be asked

to do so in the near future by National Archives, which bas

official custody of the documents, or by some higher authority.

2.

Melbourne Station is requested to discuss. Paragraph

One above with

SQUIB/Paiterhis return to Australia.

The (SQUIBC

service is mentioned in Paragraph 4 of CD 971 and release of the

document is certain to provoke questions in Australia.

CD 971 1s a U. S. Government document we need not (and should

not)

request â€¹SQUID concurrence for release of the document.

He should

be inforned, however, that release of co 97y to the puslic

domain

as presently under consideration; that the United

States Navy

has no objections; and that we are giving him advance notice

as

Any views volunteered by SQUIB/l regarding

this release should be reported proaptly to Headguarters.
