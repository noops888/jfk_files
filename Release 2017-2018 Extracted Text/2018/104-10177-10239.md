Venezuclan citizen ca 1962.

GARCIA has a long history

as a political thug since pre-Batista dajs in Cuba.

He was a member of the Union Insurrectional Revo-

legedly committed by GARCIA.

In 1953 he became a

bodyguard for Costa Rican President FIGUERES, who

introduced hin to Romulo BETANCOURT,

It is believed that GARCIA'S

fast rise in the Venezuelan government is based on his

earlier service to Accion Democratica (AD) exiles in

Costa Rica,

where he revortedly eliminated several

to kill BETANCOURT.

When BETANCOURT

that he was fed

government in order to gain her attention on the matter

of taking his cousins out of Cuba.

Nariela asked him

if he would be willing to work for the Cuban Government

and he replied he would if it would help the youngsters.

Mariela then told De ARMAS to go to Caracas and meet

with her sister Antonieta.

De ARMAS went to Caracas on

02 October 1975 and met with Antonieta,

but no proposals

were made on the possibility of his working for the
