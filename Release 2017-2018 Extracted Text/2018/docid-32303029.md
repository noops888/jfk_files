(00-Pittsburgh)

As a matter of information, PCI MIKE ZERVOS in conversation

with SAS RICHARD GORDON DOUCE and THOMAS G. FORSYTH,

7710/58 mentioned that he has been closely acquainted witho

D. MALCOLM ANDERSON, Assistant Attorney General and former

U. S. Attorney in Pittsburgh, Pa., since ANDERSON's childhood

in Donora, Pa.

ZERVOS explained that after arriving in the United States from

Greece in 1913,

operated a gambling casino during the period 1919-23 and

retained Mr. ANDERSON's father, WRIGHT ANDERSON, then a

young local attorney,

as his legal advisor. ZERVOS pointed

out that Mr. ANDERSON's father, now an Orphans' Court Judge

in Washington County, Pa., did

not openly associate himself

with ZERVOs during the period 1919-23, but offered general

legal

advice regarding

; the operation of the gambling casino

when solicited by ZERVOS to do so.

ZERVOS characterized the entire ANDERSON family, including

MR. ANDERSON's brother, BERRY ANDERSON who has

since taken

over the family law practice in Donora, as exceptionally

honest, trustworthy people and openly expressed his admiration

for MR. ANDERSON.

ZERVOS went on to say that when MR. ANDERSON was serving

as U.S. Attorney in Pittsburgh, he visited his office from

voluntarily passed along information in his possession to

MR. ANDERSON regarding racket conditions in Westmoreland

County, Pa., particularly with reference to the activities

of the

MANNARINO brothers.

ZERVOS added that approximately three months ago while in

Washington, D. C., to visit a friend in the Greek Diplomatic

Service at the Greek Embassy, he stopped at the Department

of Justice to say hello to MR. ANDERSON, but he was not in

Washington at the time.

ZERVOS said that upon his return

to Pittsburgh, Pa., he received a personal note from MR.

ANDERSON apologizing for his absence and inviting ZERVOS

to make it a point to telephone him

for lunch when he

visited Washington again.

In the process of developing ZERVOS as an informant, he has

been instructed and reminded periodically to consider his

relationship with Special Agents of the FBI confidential

and to furnish information only to the Bureau.

Nevertheless,

it seems reasonable to assume that because of

the closeness

of their alleged friendship, ZERVOS might disclose his

informant status to MR. ANDERSON and furnish information

regarding the activities of the MANNARINO brothers on his

next trip to Washington.

consequently, in order to avoid a situation of potential

embarrassment, ZERVOS is being deleted as a Pol of this

office.

In the future, information will be accepted from

ZERVOS on a voluntary basis and he will be considered a

confidential source.
