As a matter of information, PCI MIKE ZERVOS in. conversation
with SAS RICHARD GORDON DOUCE and THOMAS G, FORSYTH, III, on
7/10/58 mentioned that he has been closely acquainted with

i D. MALCOLM ANDERSON, Assistant Attorney General and former

| U. S.. Attorney in cobain Pa., since ANDERSON 'S childhood
in Donora, Pa.

ZERVOS explained that after arriving in the United States from
Greece in 1913, he settled in Donora around 1919 where he

operated a gambling casino during the period 1919-23 and %

retained Mr. ANDERSON's father, WRIGHT ANDERSON, then a : ON

young local attorney, as his legal advisor. © ZERVOS pointed fe

: out that Mr. ANDERSON's father, now an Orphans! Court Judge B

: in Washington County, Pa., did not openly associate himself 8
with ZERVOS during the period 1919-23, but offered general
legal. advice regarding the operation of the gambling casino

when solicited by ZERVOS to do so. &

ZERVOS ‘characterized the entire ANDERSON family, including bs

MR, ANDERSON's brother, BERRY ANDERSON who has since taken i

over the family law practice in Donora, as exceptionally a

honest, trustworthy people and openly expressed his admiration 6

for MR. ANDERSON. a

: is

ZERVOS went on to say that when MR, ANDERSON was serving /

as U. S. Attorney in Pittsburgh, he visited his office from
time to time to pay his respects and during such visits,

voluntarily passed along information in his possession to f
MR. ANDERSON regarding racket conditions in Westmoreland 6)
County, Pa., particularly with reference to the activities UU i
of the MANNARINO brothers,

ZERVOS added that approximately three months ago while in
Washington, D. C., to visit a friend in the Greek Diplomatic

Service at the Greek Embassy, he stopped at the Department

of Justice to say hello to MR, ANDERSON, but he was not in
Washington at the time. ZERVOS said that upon his return

_ to Pittsburgh, Pa., he received a personal note from MR. '
" ANDERSON apologizing for his absence and inviting ZERVOS ‘
: to.make it a point to telephone him for lunch when he }
visited Washington again.

In the process of developing ZERVOS as an informant, he has
been instructed and reminded periodically to consider his
relationship with Special Agents of the FBI confidential
and to furnish information only to the Bureau, Nevertheless, |
it seems reasonable to assume that because of the closeness
of their alleged friendship, ZERVOS might disclose his
informant status to MR, ANDERSON and furnish information
regarding the activities of the MANNARINO brothers on his
next trip to Washington,

Consequently, in order to avoid a situation of potential
embarrassment, ZERVOS is being deleted as a PCI of this
office. In the future, information will be accepted from
ZERVOS on.a voluntary basis and he will be considered a.
confidential source,
