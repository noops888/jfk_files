Mr. Reichardt also reported that he had informally

queried the District Director, I&NS, Miami, on the possibility

of securing such a letter, however, he had no idea that the matter

would be referred to the I&NS Central Office in Washington, D. C.

Treadily agreed that the Service could be requested to

provide such a letter as, in fact, we had made arrangements with

the Service for the entry of these individuals in

the United States.

3. In response to further inquiries, Mr

stated that

on the arrival oi these two individuals, the entry of the aliens

into the United States had not been cleared with the Office of

Security as called for by Regulation 50-110. The parties concerned

(wno arrived in December ly5y) were Manuel ARTIME and Roberto VARONA.

The OS Indices contained no record Of VARONA. A file on ARTIME

(#210830) reflects that the Wil Division requested his polygraph in

Florida and SSD provided an escort to accompany him to New Orleans

in order to enabie him to obtain a visa to Mexico. He did secure

the visa and is allegedly now in Mexico.

escort and in fact, with regard to ine endeavor or the WH Division

to obtain a visa from Mexico for the subject, on or about 15 Decem-

Haberstroh that Mr. Reicharät had contacted the District Director

in Miami, Fiorida, and requested that the Service provide a lettei

not provide such a letter. The fact that Reichardt had unilaterally

requested such a letter from the District Office of Imigration was

called to the attention of Colonel Edwards and he telephonically

informed the Chief, WH Division, that the Immigration Service would

strongly prefer if such request: were levied directly to the Central

Office and not by CIA representatives in the field.

4. At 10:45 a.m. on 15 January, the Acting Director of

Security was briefed. He suggested that the full story be requested

in writing from the Wil Division with regard to this recent arrival,

and also that the WH Division put in writing any requests for sup-

port by the Immigration Service in the form of letters to assist

inquired as to whether INS would provide a letter supporting the

position taken by the Captain of the vessel. The Captain's position

is that he discovered two stowaways aboard on the day in question,

and upon arrival in the United States, turned the stowaways over to

the ISNS?

was informed that it is doubtful if the CIA

would issue such a request to Immigration, however, he was requested

to submit his request in writing to the Director of Security.

On 1d January, Mr. Rod Landreth, of Mr.

advised that he had prepared a letter as requested and will forward

it to this Office through channels.
