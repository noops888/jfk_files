MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

SUBJECT : William George GAUDE
SF#401 996-B

i. On 15 January 1976 the attached article concerning
Subject appeared in the Washington Star. The article points
out that Subject had received a Mexican tourist visa from the
Mexican Consulate in New Orleans, the number of which immedi-
ately preceded the number of a tourist visa given to Lee
Harvey OSWALD. The article goes on to claim that GAUDET was
a CIA agent and claims that the possible relationship between
GAUDET and OSWALD was never brought to the attention of the
Warren Commission. The basis for the story's claim that
GAUDET was a CIA agent appears to be statements made by GAUDET.
He indicates in the article that he was associated with the
Agency from 1947 to 1969 and gives the impression that he
undertook clandestine missions for the Agency in Latin America.

2. A review of GAUDET's security file reveals that he
is the publisher/editor of a news letter entitled Latin American
Report. He was approved for contact by OOC in 1948. In 1950
approval was given to pay Subject for special reports which
his newsletter would compile at the request of the Agency. In
March 1953 he was again approved for contact by OOC and to
engage in discussions with them up to the level of Secret

information. he security file does not reflect how long OOC

security file does not reflect that Subject was ever asked to
undertake any clandestine assignments for the’Agency. It

appears that his only use by the Agency was debriefing of him

in regard to his expertise in Latin American affairs.

3.  GAUDET's security file does not reflect any connec-
tion between himself and Lee Harvey OSWALD.

4. After the story in the Washington Star was seen on
5 January 1976, his file was ordered from retirement in
