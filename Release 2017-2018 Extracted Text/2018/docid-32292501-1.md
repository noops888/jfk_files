WEEKLY SUMMARY

CRIMINAL INDICTMENT #28247

The trial of this case is still delayed due to legal

motions pending in behalf of the defendants.

attempting to suppress evidence allegedly obtained as a result

of the Treasury Dept. monitoring the telephone of one of the

defendants, and by virtue of the efforts of the defense to chal-

Lenge the petit jury. It is anticipated that the trial will

begin the first week of December, 1962.
