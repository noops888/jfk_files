that in this case, the first letter "A" must have represented
Communism, while the second letter would represent some

His recollection was that at the time of the
assassination the "AG" code was not yet in existence because
there were no provisions then. in effect within the Agency for
the indexing of American defectors. He recalled that it was
only during the life of the Warren Commission that the CIA

for indexing American defectors ‘and established a-code for

considered potentially significant because of the CIA's

Committee sought to investigate the allegation that Ms. McMillan's
interview with Oswald had been arranged by the CIA.

John McVickar, a eho at the. American embassy,
testified that he had Oswald's wage with Ms. McMillan, and
that he thought “she might help us-in communicating with hiw i

and help him in dealing with what appeared to be a very strong

McVickar stated, however, that he had never worked in any

McVickar's State Department and CIA files confirmed that he had

According to Ms. McMillan's testimony about the events
surrounding her interview with Lee Harvey Oswald, in November

1959 she had just returned from a visit to the United States

where she covered the Camp David summit between President

Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev. On November 16, 1959, she

went to the American embassy to pick up her mail for the first
time since her return to the Soviet Union. The mail pickup
facility was in a foyer near the consular office. Consular
Officer John A. McVickar came out of this office and welcomed
McMillan back to the Soviet Union. They exchanged a few
words, and as she was leaving, McVickar commented that at

her hotel was an American who was trying to defect to the
Soviet Union. McVickar statea that the American would not

speak to "any of us," but might speak to McMillan because she

was a woman. She recalls that as she was leaving, McVickar

McMillan to her hotel, found out the
American's room number, knocked on his door, and asked him
for an interview. The American, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not
ask her into the room, but he did agree to talk to her in her

room later that night. No American government official

arranged the actual interview with Oswald. She met with Oswald

just once. She believes that M¢Vickar called her on November 17,

the day after her interview with Oswald, aot asked her to supper.
That evening at supper they discussed her interview with Oswald.
McVickar indicated a general concern about Oswald and felt that
“the attitude of another American.consular official might have
pushed Oswald further in the direction of defection. McVickar

9. Qswald's Trip to Helsinki and the Issuance of His Entry

Visa_into the Soviet Union

Oswald's trip from London to-Helsinki has been a point

Hopkins indicated that Oswald did not appear to be

of concern to the Warren Commission. cy, In a letter -to

the CIA dated May 25, 1964, J. Lee Rankin inquired about the
apparent speed with which Oswald's Soviet visa was issued.
Rankin noted that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes

The Committee reviewed Oswald's military records because

charges that Oswald's early discharge from the Marine Corps
was designed to serve as a cover for an intelligence
assignment and that his records reflected neither his true
security clearance nor a substantial period of service in

Taiwan. These allegations were considered relevant to the

Oswald, and raised the possibility that he had intelligence
associations of some kind. The Committee's investigation,
however, revealed that military intelligence officials had
opened a file on Oswald because he was perceived as a possible
counterintelligence threat.

June of 1963 he had been serving as Operations Officer of the
112th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.*

Under the Group's control were seven regions encompassing five

States: Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

The Committee found Jones' testimony to be very credible.
— i

His statements concerning the contents of the Oswald file

are consistent with FBI communications that were generated as
a result of the information which he initially provided.
Access to Oswald's Military Intelligence file, which the
Department of Defense never gave to the Warren Commission, was
not possible because the Department of Defense had destroyed
the file as part of a general program aimed at eliminating all
of its files pertaining to nonmilitary personnel. In

response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of Defense
gave the following explanation for the file's destruction:

1. Dossier AB 652876, OSWALD, Lee Harvey, was
identified for deletion from IRR (Intelligence
Records and Reports) holdings on Julian date
73060 (1 March 1973) as stamped on the micro-
filmed dossier cover. It is not possible to
determine the actual date when physical
destruction was accomplished, but is credibly
surmised that the destruction was accomplished
within a period not greater than sixty days
following the identification for deletion.

Evidence such as the type of deletion record
available, the individual clerk involved in

the identification, and the projects in progress
at the time of deletion, all indicate the dossier
deletion resulted from the implementation of a
Department of the Army, Adjutant General letter
dated 1 June 1971, subject: Acquisition of
Information Concerning Persons and Organizations
not Affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD)
(Incl 1). Basically, the letter called for the
elimination of files on non-DOD affiliated
persons and organizations.

the actual physical destruction of the dossier.

The individual identifying the dossier for deletion
can be determined from the clerk number appearing.
on the available deletion record. The number
indicates that Lyndall E. Harp was the identifying
clerk. Harp was an employee of the IRR from 1969
until late 1973, at which time she transferred

to the Defense Investigative Service, Fort Holabird,

be noted here that the Army was not asked: to
investigate the assassination. Consequently, any
Army derived information was turned over to the

4. At the time of the destruction of the Oswald
dossier, IRR was operating under the records
disposal authority contained in the DOD Memorandum
to Secretaries of the Military Departments, OASD(A),;
9 February 1972, subject: Records Disposal
Authority (Incl 2). The memorandum forwards
National Archivist disposal criteria which is
similar in nature to the requirements outlined

in the 1 June 1971 instructions. It was not

until 1975 that the Archivist changed the criteria

Upon receipt of this information, the Committee

Counsel of the Department of.the Army replied that no such

intelligence files annually. ay

The Committee finds this “routine" destruction of the
Oswald file extremely feonb ice sal especially when viewed in
light of the Department of Defense's failure to make this file
available to the Warren Commission. Despite the credibility
of Jones’ testimony, without access to this file the question
of Oswald's possible affiliation with military intelligence
cannot be fully resolved. The absence of this file, however,
has no bearing upon the Committee's conclusion concerning
the absence of any relationship between Lee Harvey Oswald

and the CIA.
