He has no objections. They've asked if they could

be in attendance at this. I thought that I would ask,

if it is permissible.

The Witness. I would like to correct my Attorney.

I'm sorry to do this to you. They're not my friends

because the press is not my friends.

MI. Rubin. Personal acquaintances.

Mr. Triplett. We full understand that.

Mr. Sturgis, it has been the custom and the

habit of this committee to conduct closed hearings.

And for that reason, I would point out to you that

it is not within the purview of this committee to

conduct open hearings at this time, and the press

would be excluded.

The Witness. Well, one reason why I suggested

that to my Attorney is to show that -- to give me

some credibility that I'm openly and honestly, even

in the past, where it pertains to the United States

Government, I have nothing to hide naturally. And

that's one of the reasons why my. Attorney and myself

asked that question.

Mr. Triplett.

We understand that. However, just

for the orderly conduct of the hearings we prefer to

have the

press excluded at this time.

Now as you are aware this proceeding is being

her new husband's name; to Frank Anthony Sturgis.

I kept my family name as much as I possibly coula.

Mr. Triplett. very good

And for the record, you are here to make a

statement of your own volition.

This is voluntary

Now as I mentioned earlier, this entire

deposition will be transcribed and you, Mi. Sturgis,

and your Attorney, will be sent the original of this

deposition, the original transcription, and asked to

sign and verify it. And at that time we request you

return the signed and verified copy to the House

Select Committee on Assassinations.

If you have any changes in the transcript or

desire to make any changes, you should get in touch

with myself and we will make arrangements for you to

make the

changes and initial those changes that you so

desire to make, and that will have to be done before

a Federal Magistrate.

I would suggest at this time, possibly, Mr. Rubin,

that you might inform the press that it is a closed

hearing, since they're waiting outside.

Mr. Rubin. All right.

MI. Triplett. Now that the press has been

advised, one further matter.

Mr. Sturgis, I'm

n going to hand you a Xerox copy

of our Committee Document No. 06327. It's a letter

to the Chief Counsel and Stäff Director of the

Select Committee on Assassinations from the Legislative

Counsel of the Director of Central Intelligence regarding

problems with it?

The Witness. No. I understand it..

As far

as I'm concerned there is no reason why I shouldn't

appear to testify.

MI. Triplett. That's correct.

MI. Sturgis, just a few clarifying questions.

What was the date and place of your birth?

The Witness. I was born December 9th, 1924 at

Norfolk, Virginia.

Mr. Triplett. And I believe you've already

stated your parents full names on the record.

The Witness. Yes.

Mr. Rubin. Don't volunteer anything. Just answer

his questions. It'll go faster.

Mr. Triplett. And again, I don't know if you

told us what was the date you changed your name?

The Witness. I don't recall, but the Government

does have the records of when my name was changed in

Norfolk, Virginia.

Ms. Triplett. And what was the purpose for

changing your name?

The Witness.

Well, two. One, because my mother

remarried a Sturgis; and secondly, I thought it was

convenient at that time because there were so many

Frank Firoini's in my family.

MI. Triplett. Just to make it very clear, I

believe on the official court records your former

name was listed as Frank Firoinio, ending in an "O".

Was that a clerical error?

The Witness. Well, I've always, since the day

I was

born, signed my name and knew my name

school?

extension of William and Mary College.

came back I, you know, lost my rank.. But these are

the fluctuations:

MI. Triplett.' What types of training did you

receive'in the Marines?

Did you receive any special

type of training?

The Witness

Well, the Marine Corps was a highly

specialized, well, a highly trained organization as

a whole.

But when I joined the Raider Battalion, we

were trained specifically to do behind the lines

activities.

For instances, assassinations, infiltrating

enemy encampments.

These are the types that we

did

because

we were such a small

outfit.

We only had

is and:

some men In

the batallion at a particular time,

and most of our activities were done by submarines

and destroyers, First world war destroyers., Because

we were losing the war, so we had to operate behind

the enemy lines.

MI. Triplett.

Okay.

Where did you receive this raider training?

The Witness.

On American Samoa:

"And the

training continually, naturally, as we went from

operation to operation. It was continuous

training

out in the Pacific.

Mr. Triplett. What did you do after you were

discharged from the Marines as far as an occupation?

The Witness. I came home and because of the

influence of my family, the Fiorini family in

Norfolk, Virginia, I got on the Norfolk Police

Department.

I spent -- not at the beginning - but

I was a plain clothes police officer.. I did go

through training that we had which they called the

Police Academy training.

And from then I was working as manager of several

bars there in Norfolk, Virginia..

Mr. Triplett. Did you subsequently enter the

military service, any other military service?

The Witness. Yes. I was in the United States

Naval Air Reserve, stationed at Norfolk Naval Air

Station as a Radio Gunner there.

And eventually I

did receive an honorable discharge.

Mr. Triplett. When did you enter the Naval

Reserve?

The Witness. Oh, that was, I would say after

I got off the Police Department. I would think it

might have been in

radio gunner?

The Witness. Well, we took our training with

the PBY's.

We learned radio. And weapons was no

problem because I had my basic training with the

Marines

as

far as weapons were concerned.

Mr. Triplett. And did you receive any special

training in the Naval Reserve?

trained.

Mr. Triplett. What rank did you attain in the

Mr. Triplett:

And what kind of training, if

any, did you receive in the Merchant Marines?

The Witness.

Actually no training at

all. Because

I did join the union.: In order to get in the Merchant

Marine you had to be cleared.

You had to get a U.s.

And through them I naturally received certain jobs

on Merchant ships.

MI. Triplett. Okay:

In line with those jobs, did you have occasion

to travel?

The Witness. Yes,

sir.

Mr. Triplett. And do you recall, or can you

list some of the ports you traveled to during that

period?

The Witness. Well, I'll give you one in particular.

I went to theone up in Greenland, which was one of our

biggest air bases that we had, about 200 miles this

side of the North Pole. I'm trying to remember the

name of it. I forget the name

of it, but it's one

of our biggest bases we had, military bases we had

in Greenland.

MI. Triplett. And did you have occasion to

travel back and forth between this country and Europe

in the Merchant Marine?

The

Witness.

Yes.

Mr. Triplett. Approximately how long were

you in the Merchant Marine?

The Witness. Not too long. I'd say possibly

a year, a year and a half, approximately.

Mr. Triplett. And what was your reason for

leaving the Merchant Marine?

The Witness. The situation, international

situation with the United States Government as far

as shipping was concerned, was getting very bad. They

were doing it more with foreign carriers than they

were with American carriers, and naturally American

unions were a little upset with that. So I could

not make a living really, by staying with the Merchant

Marine.

Mx. Triplett. I see.

And after you left the Merchant Marine, what

did you do as far as an occupation is concerned?

The Witness. Well, I had a night club that

I was involved with called the Top Hat Night Club

on Virginia Beach, Virginia. I also was part owner

partner. I had a bar on Main Street in Norfolk called

the -- I was part owner in that.

It's been so many

years ago.

Anyway, before I went with him to the night club

I was part owner at this bar and then when we sold

the bar that's when I started to

go to the Merchant

Marine thing.

And one of the reasons why I quit the Merchant

Marine was because he

convinced me to go into the

business of the night club. Now it's coming back.

Mr. Arthur Bass.

So I went into the night club business with him.

This was another reason why I discontinued going with

the Merchant Marine.

MI. Triplett. And how long were you in the night

club business with Mr. Bass?

The Witness. I imagine a good couple of years.

Mr. Triplett. And following that, did? you

subsequently enlist in the United States Army?

The Witness. les, I did.

Mr. Triplett. Approximately when, if you recall.

did you enlistein the United States Army?

The Witness. I imagine it would be in the

50' s.

This was at the time of the russian blockade of Berlin.

When I joined the Army, I signed up in Norfolk,

Virginia. I believe it was Norfolk, Virginia.

SNI

went to Fort Dix, New Jersey. I passed my OCs

test

and they were going to send me to Officer Candidate

school, and I asked

if they had one in Europe and

they said yes, they did. And they lied to me.

So when I went to Europe I found out that the

Army lied to me and they did not have an Officer

Candidate School there. That I would have to

you know, à year in order to come back to the States

and go to the Officer Candidate School back here.

So I immediately asked to go overseas and a few

weeks later - I did not have to get training because

of my prior training and because of my combat experience,

I was sent to, I believe it was Marburg (phonetic),

Germany; which was a repo depot there, a replacement

outfit there, where they sent me to Berlin, Germany,

and I was with the Fourth Regiment there, and I was

with General Clay's Honor Guard.

Mr. Triplett. What was your purpose in asking

to be sent to Europe?

The Witness.

• To

go through Officer Candidate

School.

Mr. Triplett. Well, Officer Candidate School

was available here, but you said you wanted to go to

OCS in Europe. What was your purpose in wanting to

go to Europe?

The Witness. Well, I wanted to go back to Europe

because I had been to. Europe before and I liked

Europe. And I felt well, I'd prefer to go to Europe

and I was having problems with my first wife at that

time and I just wanted to get away from the United

States.

Mr. Triplett. What rank did you attain in the Army?

Oh, when I left Berlin, Germany, I was having

a very close affair with a young lady there who happened

to be going with a Colonel on General Clay's Staff,

so I was immediately sent out of Berlin back to Marburg.

which in turn they sent me to Heidleburg, Germany,

which was headquarters, UCOM Headquarters, and I was

assigned to Armed Security Agency, which I had the

clearance for.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

Besides Marburg, Heidleburg and Berlin, were

you stationed in any other places in Europe?

places in Europe, but these were the places that I

was actually stationed.

Mr. Triplett.

Now will you again describe, you

say you had security clearance at Heidleburg?

The Witness. Oh, you would have to have security

clearance with the Armed Service Security Agency.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

Exactly what were your functions there?

under command of, I believe he was a First Sergeant,

who was directly in command of a Colonel and my

functions was typing, which if you asked me to type

My

went along, was being trained again. Basic military

training was not necessary because of my past military

training, but specialized training. For instance

like Army Security. Agency. As you went along you

received that particular type of training.

MI. Triplett.

What exactly was the Honor Guard

Well, the function of the Honor

Guard was a specialized group of military personnel

that was trained specifically that when any high

ranking officer or political VIP that came into the

area, at the airport to military bases, the Honor

Guard would perform for these particular people.

Mr. Triplett.

So it was more a show function

rather

than a military function?

The Witness. Military, right. You would call

it a military function if a General came in lyou know.

That would be a show military function for them.

It

looked good.

Well, I was in the mountains in

Cuba with Fidel Castro. My first contact with any

was with the Vice-Consul in Santiago, Cuba. One

of my missions when I came out of

the mountains was

to deliver

some secret messages to the underground

in Santiago.

When I was in Santiago I always went to the

Casa Grande Hotel, which was the biggest hotel there,

and one evening, which was on a Friday, I sat down

to play bingo and an American came to my table and made

contact with me and was playing bingo, and he identified

himself as we went along. in a few hours, he told me

was the Vice-Consul. Also, he was the Chief of the

CIA stationed there in Santiago.

And he questioned me and so forth. This is where

first started to spy on Castron forces for the .

United

States Government.

Mr. Triplett. So that was your first contact?

The Witness.. Yes, sir.

Consul. It's on record. His name is on record.

MI. Triplett. Would

it be Clark Wollen?

It'll come to me. Unfortunately I didn't know what

questions you were going to ask me, otherwise I would

have written it down because I have it at home. I

would have written down his name.

Mr. Triplett. But in any event you could provide

that name later to MI. Fonzi or myself?

Oh, certainly. As a matter of

him about him. I

gave him the name. But I could

give Mr. Fonzi his name. No problem.

Mr. Triplett.. Okay.

While you were gathering this information

presumably in 1958, were you paid for these services?

The Witness. I was offered money, but I refused

it and the reason why I refused it was the fact that

I felt that in helping my country at that particular

time, I had my own resources which was with Castro.

Money was

3 no problem, so I didn't feel that I needed

to take money from my own Government who I voluntarily;

when he asked, to go ahead and spy for the United

States Government there.

Mr. Triplett. So you rejected any money at

that time?

The Witness.: Actually, yes.

Mr. Triplett.: When did you first arrive in

Cuba? *

The Witness. Well, my connection with the --

oh, my uncle, after I got out of the Marine Corps,

I came to Miami to live and my uncle married a Cuban

lady, a young lady, at that time, whose family was

here in exile. This is how I had

I had a family, or married into my family. This

was on the Vona side.

And my connection with the Cuban colony was through

Fidel left Mexico, came to the United States,

Mr. Triplett.

(Interposing) This was after you

Yeah.

Mr. Triplett. Would that' be before you went

The Witness. Yeah. The first contact with the

Cuban exile people.

Then I met Carlos Prio, the ex-President of

Cuba and I had an association with him.

As time went

on, I believe it was, it might have been '56, or '57,

as :

time went

on I tried to convince President Carlos

prio that the people, his gorilla force in the

mountains of Cuba was not very active. That I felt

that it might be a good idea for me to go there to

help in the training of the gorillas and to step up

the military actions there.

He agreed, but that wasn't the question.

The

question that he

needed was naturally the arms that

the gorilla forces needed to fight against the Batista

times,

helping finance Fidel Castro.

This was a decision between you and. Carlos Prio?

Catholic Church. I went to Santiago and I was in

touch with certain people in the Church there who

took me personally - I'm sorry, they didn't take

me personally -- they toid me to go to Motonzos.

TO

with a priest there who took me out in the countryside

to meet a Cuban fellow who was the manager of the

coca cola plant there in Montonzo. And I stayed at

his place where he took me to a farm house this side

of the mountains where I waited for a cuban patrol:

•So I did not see Fidel for a period of about

oh, I would say seven or eight days later, that I came

across Fidel. I forget the name of the small -- in

the mountains -- a small

conglomerate of houses that

were along the mountain side and this is where I

met Fidel again. Because remember, I met Fidel in

Miami, Florida before he went to Cuba.

MI.

Triplett. All right.

Once you met Fidel, I presume you joined up

with him, or stayed with him?

The Witness.

Well, not exactly joined with

him because my sympathies were with the Cuban exiles

against the Dictator Batista.

It was decided later with Prio that I would

go ahead and join Fidel's group of people.

Mr. Triplett. And prior to Fidel taking over

and throwing out Batista, what functions did you

perform for Mr. Castro?

The Witness. Helped train the gorillas in the

mountains; went on missions, secret missions for

messages; bought guns and equipment for the Castro

forces; delivered these guns and equipment to the

and I left Santiago and came over.

all the military bases inside of Cuba.. I set up

an intelligence

apparatus for Castro outside of Cuba,

namely in the United States

which in turn I notified

the Government of the Agents that were being set up

here.

Set up an intelligence apparatus

here in the

United States through the Cuban Air Force.

At the same time the American Government was

advised of these Cuban agents working in the south

Florida area.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

So that was not clandestine as far as

the

American Government was concerned?

Certainly it was clandestine.

Mr. Triplett. Well, was the American Government

aware of the names and activities of these Cubans?

No, I don't think so because they did not know of

my contact with the Embassy at that time.

I was advised to make contact with Colonel

Nichols. Colonel Nichols was the military attache

for the Cuban Air Force.

Mr. Triplett. And is he the one to whom you

provided the names of these agents?

The Witness. Not only provided the names of

these agents but also the various conspiracies that

were taking place within Havana, of people from

Costa Rica, from Panama, people from the Dominican

Republic, people from Hati. The various central

and South American countries came there trying to

make

contact directly with Fidel or members of the

hierachy, which I was part of this. But they themselves

could not get direct contact with Fidel which was

very very difficult because of the turmoil that was

going on there.

the Central American countries and these Caribbean

things which again the American Government was being

advised through me.

Mr. Triplett. Were any Castro agents arrested

as a result of this information you were giving the

American Government?

The Witness. No, sir, and I'll tell you the

reason why. Because I didn't find out until years

later that through many of the meetings that we had

had in Havana at the very beginning, many of us

suspected that the American Embassy was

helping in

guiding Fidel Castro, especially CIA.

At one of the meetings I was asked to bypass

"the Embassy and

go directly to Washington, D.C. to

make contact with Mr. Hoover because being that we

were strongly anti-communist and because of the

information that many of our people had and the

contacts that they had pertaining to the Embassy,

had the sympathies of many of the Embassy personnel

and also of the CIA personnel assisting Castro which,

at that time, we didn't know this definitely. But

we suspected it. Later we found it was a true fact.

So I did bypass with information pertaining to

the Castro brothers and

pertaining to many of the

Communists who were being put in various positions by

the Castro brothers, which we were définitely against.

So I went on a special mission to Washington.

Made contact with

the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I believe - I did not speak with Mr. Hoover personally

but I believe I spoke to his right-hand man.

Mr. Triplett.

Do you recall his name?

But it should

be on record.

The Witness. (Interposing) No, sir. It's been

so many years I don't recall.

Mr. Triplett. Olsen?

The Witness.. I don't recall.

But later on Pedro Diez and Marcus Diez Lanz

themselves had, either one of them had contact,

personal contact with Mr. Hoover.

MI. Triplett. Now when was this you went to

Washington?

The Witness.

oh,

gee, I'm not sure whether

it was February of 1959 or not.

•I'm not sure.

January, February or March. One of those three months.

But I'm sure it was immediately in February.

Mr. Triplett. And still at this time you were

at least outwardly working with and for the Fidel

who you could trust and who you couldn't trust.

But that particular time when I went to Washington,

nobody at the Embassy knew that I went directly to

Mr. Triplett. Now when you say you were working

for the Embassy, who precisely at that time were you

working with?

The Witness. Well let me say I had an

association.

I'm sorry, because sometimes I

get overt.

My association with the Embassy was through Colonel

Nichols who was the military attache at the Embassy.

Mr. Triplett. And was there anybody else also?

The Witness... I beg your pardon?

Mr. Triplett. Was there anybody else you

were associating with in your capacity?

The Witness. The only one I had contact with

was Colonel Nichols

MI. Triplett. All right.

The Witness. I went to the Embassy several

times. A document, which I'm sure Pedro oI Marcus

the Embassy, named me -- I forget how it is again --

Intelligence Service wanted to know what I, as

Director of Security; was doing at the Embassy, I

had a document that it was an official visit because

of the Air Force and the American Air Force mission

that was there at the time.

Mr. Triplett. As a matter of fact, at that

time, what was

the nature of your association with

Clark Wollen?

The Witness. Well, Clark Wollen was down in

Santiago.

When I left Santiago, that was it. I

finished with them.

Then my contact was with Nichols

in Havana.

And to be honest with you, the Chief of Station,

which was

the Vice-Consul, because Clark wollen was

the Consul, the American Consul there, and I don't

believe -- again I'm going back so many years -- I

don't believe my contact was with wollen.

I believe

my contact

was with the Vice-Consul and again I'm

trying to remember his name. Anderson comes to my mina,

Mr. Triplett. Could it have been Jim Knowles?

No, sir. Jim Knowles worked out

Mr. Triplett. All right.

DOES

the name Stewart ring a bell?

The Witness. Jack Stewart? No, sir. I know

who you're talking about. He worked out of the

Embassy.

MI. Triplett. Did you have occasion to recruit

or enlist the support of other people in this

intelligence gathering activity?

The Witness. Yes, sir.

Mr. Triplett. And what would be the correct

designation? Recruiting? Enlisting support? Asking

for help? How would you describe it?

The Witness. Well, I would describe it as

making contact with people within the Cuban military,

the Cuban political and even the American colony that

was there.

Naturally my friends Pedro and Marcus Diez Lanz

are. very pro-American and they had the right contacts

with a number of people in the American Embassy

and Marcus Diez Lanz that you recall?

The Witness.

That I asked for help in the

intelligence gathering?

Mr. Triplett. Yes. Geraldine Shamma.

She

lives in Hollywood, Florida. She was turned over

to Major Van Horne (phonetic). She worked with

Major Van Horne in the American Embassy.

As a matter of fact this woman here had a close

contact with me when she was working in Havana. We

had the Brickell House here on Brickell: Avenue that

the MRR was using. We all gathered there. She had

a small apartment in the back of the Brickell House,

a safe house. And she was traveling back and forth

"to Havana. And she was later arrested and given a

ten year sentence for spying.

Served three and a

half years in Guandhi (Phonetic) prison, came over

here to the United States.

Geraldine and I have been very very close. And

unfortunately, physically, this prison sentence that

she received hurt her very bad both mentally and

The Witness. I don't recall. I spoke to a

number of people, you know, who were attached to

the Embassy and I honestly don't recall certain agents:

You must understand one thing. When I was

associated myself with Colonel Nichols, I received

bits and pieces from Colonel Nichols that many of

the people -- not many -- his words were somewhat like;

you can't trust some of the people in CIA there.

• AS

went along I found out that CIA did help Fidel, guide

him into power. The Communists,: Cuban Communists Party

did make a couple of attempts to kill Fidel and I

believe that CIA'was advising Fidel of what was going

on and so forth. They were very pro-communist, these

agents. Jim Knowles, to me, was one of them. The

"Station Chief.

As a matter of fact Ambassador Smith accused,

Station

at

a meeting with

• the

other agents of, you know, being pro-communist by

having a close association with the Castro brothers.

Mr. Triplett.

Naturally they have their own means of making contact.

If it isn't directly through me, they make their own

me to be involved in several of these conspiracies.

And one was the Panama Canal. I told him I thought

of this expedition that is being formed to invade

maybe in February of the beginning of March. She

information through my people, through Fidel's people

that Fidel was living with her. She went to work

to put Communist people into the Air Force, and I'm

trying to keep them out under orders of Marcus

day

because a Jimmy Gentry (phonetic), who was very close

to Raul Castro and who was a pilot, made some very

he would kill Pedro because Pedro was very anti-

communist, and he pulled his gun on me and I in turn

took his .45

away from him and marched him to the

Air Force office of Pedro. And naturally I ran him

off the base.

So there was friction there against

Raul Castro. But Fidel was more diplomatic and

against us, many of the military commanders who helped

him, who was in high positions,

so Fidel had to go

ahead and smooth things over. But he knew who was

"against him.

MI. Triplett. Okay.

On how many occasions were you aware of -- well,

strike that.

On how many occasions were you involved in plans

or attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro?

The Witness. Well, I would say -- well, there

were numerous plots that I was involved in. And I

would say the most serious plots -- I'm talking about

the real

serious ones that I was involved in -- was

about three.

Mr. Triplett. Now you mentioned Geraldine

Shamma and Marita Lorenz. Other than those

two,

were other people involved in these plots?

The Witness... Well; Geraldine Shamma was not

involved in any plots in particular to kill Fidel Castro.

I was told, well okay, unless we get the word

from Washington, don't do anything. But at the same

time I had meetings with military commanders who

wanted to kill him.

Mr. Triplett. These were Cuban military

commanders, or American?

The Witness.

No. They were Cuban military

commanders who wanted to kill Fidel and who were

trying to, you know, devise a way. And I offered

like, hey, I've got command of the military police,

which I was personally training these people. See,

at the same time being Director of Security, same

time spying over here, same time being involved in

all these damn conspiracies, you know, so I had a

comes to the Air Force Base.

If he goes someplace

in the country he flies in with a helicopter. He

comes over, he sees me, he hugs me, you know, and

he has meetings on the second floor of the headquarters

her, in February.

So it might have been in March

because I had to get, you know, I don't just come

out when I just meet her, you know, I

had to gain

Because it was a very ticklish

crazy about Fidel. This is

Fidel Castro took over in Cuba January Ist, 1959.

In

relation to that date, when did you first become

disenchanted with Fidel Castro and when did you first

have a suspicion that he was a Communist?

The Witness. All of us -- I'm talking about

my friends like Commander Ricardo Lauria (phonetic),

Commander Hubamartis (phonetic):, Commander Pedro

Diez Lanz, Commander Marcus Diez Lanz, myself and

other commanders, had various meetings all over

Havana secretly. And I would say that by the time

of February, 1959, it was definitely decided, because

"of all the activities that was

going on with the

various top Communist people, that Raul was trying

to get into the military. And so far he couldn!t

get them into the Air force because I was running

them off, you

see. But we suspected and damn well

knew that Fidel was a Communist

and working with

the Communist Party.

Also by February we suspected that CIA was

guiding Fidel also in this thing.

This is why I was sent -- it might have been

February or March -- I was sent directly to Washington.

To bypass the Embassy.

Mr. Triplett. You were sent there by whom?

Mr. Triplett. If you could give a reason, what

would be the reason for the failure of any attempts

on Fidel Castro's life at that time?

The Witness. Well, I would say that the

individual persons that were being used in order to

go ahead and kill him. I was in the best position in

the world to go ahead and really kill him, if I was

in charge of killing Fidel. I was in

the best

position because I could have stopped him right at

that gate there. Every time Fidel would come in, he

would come in in a convoy. I would stop the convoy

because I was out there one day when I was inspecting

and I could have killed everybody. Because

I had

people and I trained people, you know, to check the

roofs, the main street, the main entrance of the Air

Force Base.

We checked the roofs out, and

I could

have had machine gunners up there with hand grenades

and machine guns and i could have wiped that whole

god-damned convoy out. Could have killed everybody.

Mr. Triplett. But you apparently were not

in charge: You did not have

If I knew

then what I know today I would have

there, see. And I would have listened to my friends

and I would have killed Fidel.

But because I was an American, my decision

was more toward the Americans than my own friends,

which I should have went along with my friends. I

would have killed that dirty bastard.

Well, let me tell you what happened there.

I

had to arrange the escape óf Pedro Diez Lanz because

of the Embassy because they refused him aslyum, which

I resented bitterly. Marcus Diez Lanz also. All right

Meantime, at that time we thought CIA was still

all right, but we had our suspicions within the

Embassy.

Marcus Diez Lanz was helped by CIA later to get

out. This was, I would say, a month later. But when

I came over on June the 30th, I took two aircraft from

Cuba over here. One was a C-46D, that was in my name,

and a B-25 bomber that was in my name. Okay?

Now, so I had

to arrange to

get those airplanes

over here before I defected. I had meetings over there

with Pedro and so forth and I wanted to cause an

uprising there. I said look, I have command of

1,000 troops here at the Air Force Base. Let's get

hold of President Arukia (phonetic). I'll put 500

men around the Capital, the Presidential Palace, if

President Arukia will denounce Castro, you know, and

the Communists.

President Arukia said no. That Castro was

misguided and said no. Well, he was saving his own

ass is what he was doing.

But also I wanted to go ahead and destroy much

it down.

MI. Triplett. Again, these were the

people

at the Embassy that turned it down?

The Witness. I'm not sure the Embassy was

aware. At least they were not aware of this

particular operation that I wanted to do. They

were not aware through me.

Mr. Triplett. Okay..

Getting back to after

you returned to the United States.

To your knowledge, were you ever contacted by

any representatives of the CIA for any purpose?

The Witness.

Iwas contacted by an official of

to get a boat to go into Cuba and get Pedro out and

get Marcus out and his family.

I was told, Frank, leave it alone.

Don't touch

them out.

Shakter, Schenley (phonetic).

Mr. Triplett.

It might have been Schenley,

Shackler. One of the two. Told me, stay here, don't

Because I was arranging with Pedro.

So what the half brother did with the boat, we

used it, they allowed Surgio to go but didn't want me

to go because I was an American and they knew Castro

would catch me.

Then CIA did make arrangements to get Marcus Diez

Lanz out because Marcus was in touch with an agent in

Cuba, a CIA agent.

And that agent, if you'd like to

know who he is, that was Bernard Barker.

Mr. Triplett. All right.

Now after you returned to the United States,

did you have any contact with any Castro Intelligence

Agents?

Here in the United States?

The Witness. No. At least not to my knowledge.

Because

some of the people we didn't know. No.

You would assume that Castro, with what people

we knew over here. If they were agents, would change

them around.

so no.:

We kept to ourselves.

The reison for that is, remember, we were

Cuban revolutionaries, all right? We helped overthrow

the Batista Government.

so the first group of

refugees that come over here were the Batista people,

or at least the people that were very sympathetic,

which they had

l reason to. leave there because Castro

was shooting everybody, which was wrong on his part.

So naturally when we came here we more or less 'kept

Well let's say the B-25 was in

my name. Registered with the FAA in my name.

well,

the money, before the Bay of Pigs invasion,

the monies that went to the repairs of the B-25, was

CIA money:

As a matter of fact 'I was told later while I

was in prison, by Howard, that Howard -- Howard Hunt

I'm talking about -- Howard Hunt said he did give

Barker $10,000 to turn over to Pedro to pay the

bills of the B-25.

I think we had an L. B: Smith

over here at 36th Street Airport being repaired.

And one of the things that the B-25 was going

to be used, which we were fixing the airplane up

because we were going to put on the tail of the B-25,

a long antennea that would be stretched out while

the aircraft was in flight with tape recordings and

in Cuba while the B-25 was in flight... This was one

of the operations. And the monies did come from CIA

for the repairs and the bill to the B-25.

Mr. Triplett. And did you know at that time it

came from the CIA?

The Witness. Certainly.

Sure. I didn't know

who it came from because the money

came from Barker.

Because I didn't know who Barker's boss was.

You must understand that a week before -- this

I found out through Howard Hunt while I was in prison --

a week before the invasion, Bernard Barker was the

assistant to Howard.

Howard, from what Howard told me, that he

disagreed with the policies of what was happening,

the change that was happening within, you know, the

groups, the CIA and the Revolutionary Council, because

he was

the political officer of the Revolutionary

Council. I had no contact with Howard Hunt. I never

knew Howard Hunti at all. I knew there was an Eduardo

and Eduardo was Barker's boss.

But he left the outfit and Barker was turned

over to a new CIA control Officer, I believe. And

Barker would not tell me.

I believe his new boss

was Jim Knowles.

Mr. Triplett. And what led you to believe that?

was Jim Knowles or not. Because you know, sometimes

you don't say things, you know.

I'm not sure.

But

Barker never told me who his new control officer was.

But I believe it was Jim Knowles.

Again, this B-25 was the same B-25 that Pedro

Diez Lanz and myself as pilots and Marcus

Diez Lanz

and another Cuban fellow by the name of Itchgoia

(phonetic) flew over on october the 21st of 1959,

over the City of Havana, and dropped several hundred

thousands of leaflets over that City. And several

•Cubans; I think maybe 31 or 33 Cuban people were

killed and wounded on that air raid that we did.

Mr.

Triplett. Dropping leaflets?

The Witness. Leaflets, yeah. Well, you see

we were 1,000 foot off the ground over the City and

the gunners from Cabana Fortress and the three B-26

fighter bombers tried to shoot us down and the shells

exploding killed or wounded 31 or 33 people. And

Fidel raised a lot of hell about it.

And as a matter of fact, charges were brought

against Pedro Diez Lanz in Federal Court here about

these things and it was thrown out a half hour later

No. That's the only B-25, and

the B-26 that was ever purchased. And that was in

my name, registered with the FAA, or at that time

I think it was the CAA, or whatever.

Mr. Triplett. Did you have any contact, or

Ray Sanstrom is also a pilot.

Ray Sanstrom, I believe, worked for CIA.

several times

during my inspection of the casinos.

Because one of my other jobs for Castro at one time,

he wanted me to take charge of the casinos for Pasternita

Nunez, who was in the mountains with me and with Fidel.

from Cuba. Like, you know, Nino Diez I knew from

Cuba.

And Nino was involved in the Bay of Pigs.

Sangenis is one name.

So what he did

is cut the name in half and said Sam Jenis.

So that

was his code name.

Mr. Triplett. Code name for what purpose?

The Witness. CIA. He was the head of Operation

40.

One of my Watergate associates, Phillipe Diego

(phonetic) was also Operation 40.

Mr. Triplett.. Now just for the record, what

exactly was Operation 40?

The Witness. It was an intelligence operation.

Understand, before the Bay of Pigs invasion, you

had three different

groups that the CIA controlled.

CIA controlled the Revolutionary Council, which was

political.

This was where Howard Hunt was in the

political end of it. Okay, I had nothing to do with

the political end of it, even though I knew. Tony

Lahone (phonetic) and some of the people in the

-political:

Mr. Triplett.

You're talking about the CRC?

The Witness.

Yeah. Cuban Revolutionary Council.

Thenyou had the Brigade, which another person

controlled that.

Then you had Operation 40 which Sam Jenis

controlled.

So I had my associations in between really because

pilots and myself, towards this special air group.

At the

same time I had, naturally, association with

the Sangenis family.,

Operation 40; the primary job was intelligence.

In other words once a beach head was made inside

of Cuba, the people to follow the beach head would.

be intelligence, which would be Operation 40, which

already had contact inside Cuba through the CIA

naturally. The Cuban CIA agents would immediately

have direct contact with Operation 40.

And being an intelligence organization

going

into Cuba, in other words, to maintain contact with

the local populace, the political and the military

connections. That both CIA and members of this

whole invasion

group, whether it was the Revolutionary

Council or the Brigade

or from

Operation 40 or CIA,

make contact. And it's understandable that you have

an organization like Operation 40 to make contact

with certain people. If there's any betrayal with

the people you make contact with in Cuba, well

naturally it's logical, in order to fend your

operation you would eventually start

got together trying

to get the Cubans together to organize a resistance

movement in exile against the Castro Government.

Mr. Triplett. When you say get together. Did

you have brief meetings with Tony and the rest of

We even went to New York with Marcus Sterling up

there. We spoke with ex Presidents, you know.:

with Tony Varona at the time?

Central America and I did secure, or I did ask for

Naval Intelligence, to ask for help, you know, to

locate where MI. Roark and his pilot -- Sullivan

was his pilot who made this trip to Central America --

Mr. Triplett. (Interposing) This was the time

that Mr. Roark turned up missing?

Yes, they did. They immediately

sent

out, I believe, Coast Guard aircraft and'I

believe possibly Naval Air Force:

I'm not sure, you

know, what they did, but I know they did go out and

provide the necessary search mission for locating the

aircraft.

Mr.. Triplett. And was this because Mr. Roark

was a member of Naval Intelligence, or an associate?

The Witness.

I didn't know too much of Alex's

background. Alex was a friend of mine.

Very strongly

anti-communist. Alex did have an association in the

past with the FBI. His association, I would say that

he worked for them, not as an informant.

but for them.

In what position, I don't know.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

What was your purpose in approaching Naval

Intelligence on his behalf, as opposed to State

Department, Coast Guard, Navy in general, Army?

The Witness. I'll be very honest with you.

that particular time I didn't know.

I wanted some

The Witness.

Yes.

As a matter of fact I did have a meeting with

Alex the day before he left on this mission, on this

trip, at opa locka airport.

Mr. Triplett. You say he was on a mission.

On whose behalf was

that mission?

The Witness. I don't know at that particular

time. All I know is, we had the meeting at opa locka

airport. He told us he was on his way to Central

America and then he completely disappeared.

Mr. Triplett. Have you had occasion on other

occasions to phone Naval Intelligence and ask for

assistance?

The Witness. No.

Mr. Triplett. Or to provide information?

The Witness.

NO :

Mr. Triplett. Have you been involved with

organizations that have raised funds privately to

perform anti-Castro

activities?

Raids, propaganda

or whatever?

and tell you one of the

groups, because most of the

people I don't know who they got the funds from

because it was not my position to do that. From

Bacardi Rum Company, which the Vice-Consul, the

Station Chief in Santiago works for the Rum Company

after his retirement.

Mr. Triplett. And as a result of raising this

money, did you personally make any trips into and

out

of Cuba?

DI. Louie Conte Aguerro was being trained and

The Witness. I can not exactly tell you that

But he contacted me at a meeting at the Miami Springs

Villa one time with a whole room full of Cubans there

who knew me, many of them knew me.

One of the

persons that was with him was Oscar Mastre (phonetic).

They owned like GMQ in Cuba, his family. Which these

people

naturally had very close CIA connections

and

had their own financing. You've

got to understand

a lot of these people, they have their own financing.

They would give money and the Government would

reimburse them. so it isn't like it's coming directly

from the Government. That's how they work. Go through

I their fronts.

And they asked me to do a series of air raids

in Cuba, but to drop nothing but leaflets, which I

agreed.

I felt that -- there were five operations

and they asked me what the operations were,

how much

money it would cost to do the

operations, and I told

them approximately about $5,000 per operation. That

would lease the plane, the pilots

involved and so

forth. And I would obtain the pilots because they

wanted

me to stay out of it.

But unfortunately, because some of the pilots

couldn't find

their way in the daytime, as well as

at night time, I had to go ahead and do them myself.

Perform the operation myself personally.

Mi. Triplett. By the way, when and where did

you receive your flight training?

The Witness. In Norfolk, Virginia.

Mr. Triplett. Through the military or privately?

The Witness.: No, sir, privately.: I took it

through the GI Bill of Rights, my pilot training and

so forth, through CAP. I was operations officer for

a Civil Air Patrol Squadron Number 1 in Norfolk, and

started to get my hours in in single engine

aircraft

and so forth.

About how many missions in and out of Cuba did

you make?

them.

No, I did over 100. Over 100

Government.

Mr. Triplett. When you say with the knowledge,

did you receive money from a representative of the

Government, or was there a cut out like you described

to where some private funds were replaced by the

Government?

The Witness: I would say that I myself personally

did not receive the money directly from the Government.

It was done through other people, which other people

got me to do it. For instance, DI. Louie Conte

Aguerro.

He directly said, "Frank, what's the

operation cost? Here's the money." And I got it.

Mr. Triplett. And what was the average cost

of each operation?

The Witness.

About $5,000. $5,000 period.

Mr. Triplett. And that -- did that include

money or reimbursement for you and the other people

involved to support your families?

The Witness. No. That was money for the

particular operation.

MI. Triplett. Well like you say, flying in

and out of Cuba, one flight, dropping leaflets, would

have cost $5,000?

The Witness. Right. Sure.

You've

got an

aircraft. You've got to pay the pilots. You had

"to give the pilots like $1,500 each to do this mission.

This was a mission that was a naturally dangerous

mission.

Yes, as a matter of fact Alex went on several

of these missions with me, taking pictures of the

The Witness.

Right.

Mr. Triplett. And how many meetings did you

have with Mr. Barker?

The Witness. Oh, numerous.

Mr. Triplett. All at his home?

The Witness. No. I had meetings at restaurants,

at his home.

MI. Triplett. At how many of these meetings did

money actually change hands at the meeting?

The Witness.

Never with me personally. As

a matter of fact I received

I gifts from him, from his

boss.

Either going out to the Ranch House which was

on, close to 36th Street near LeJuene Road. There

used to be a Ranch House there. He took me there.

He took me to dinner and said the boss told me to take

you to dinner.

gave

me a bottle of booze.

Eduardo. The second

one naturally I believe it was Jim Knowles, and I

think Jack Stewart comes in there somewhere.

MI. Triplett. You had never personally met

Eduardo?

The Witness. No. We'd all heard in the Cuban

colony of Eduardo because he was political. Belonged

to the political sector of CIA. And I had nothing

to do with the political sector. And that had to

be done with the Cuban Revolutionary Council.

Mr. Triplett.

Do you know who Eduardo was?

The Witness. Personally, no. But I knew who

Eduardo was: It was Barker's CIA control officer.

Mr. Triplett. You never met him before 1972?

To the best of my knowledge I

had never met this man before 1972. The name I knew,

Eduardo. I did not know E. Howard Hunt was Eduardo.

Never personally met this

man to the best of my

knowledge. Never at all: I

don't ever recall meeting

E. Howard Hunt, nor did I know that Eduardo was E.

Howard Hunt before 1972. Never knew the connection

between

them.

Mr. Triplett. All right.

What was your role with respect to the

International Anti-Communist Brigade?

The Witness. Well, going back, understand,

my role was at one time this was a group that I formed

which were one of many many groups that was formed

in the Miami area. I'm talking about Cuban

groups

who were anti-Castro

groups.

And Jerry Patrick Heming (phonetic) had a group

Believe me.

Real raunchy. And they just more

or less shifted away.

Mr. Triplett. You mentioned Heming and

Rolando Masferer. Who else was involved?

The Witness. Well, I have never had any

dealings

with Rolando Masferer. Because you must

understand that Rolando Masferer was a Senator in

Cuba who, under the Batista regime, had a terrible

name for torture and killing and so forth.

Mr. Triplett. His nickname was El Tigere

wasn't it?

The Witness. El Tigere, little tiger.

But he was in exile. And we more or less -- when

•I say we, I talk about people like the Diez Lanz

brothers and myself and other Cubans who more or less

were anti-Batista, naturally. And so even

as the

years went by we integrated with certain people in

the Cuban colony that had dealings with Batista in

the past, but only certain people. And Masferer was

not one of these people.

the sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale:

Mr. Triplett. Well, did you form it all on

your own, or were other people involved in the

own.

I had, I think, Ray Sanstrom take care of the

legal aspects of it and

any letters or correspondence

that would come in would

go to his office and so forth,.

and that was it.

But as I came out, people like Jerry Patrick

'reminded me well, he was with my group and this and

that and you met him and so forth. And then there

Loren Hall did leave the Miami area, did go out

that I met through Jerry Patrick. There was a

parachute group, you know, that he was trying to form.

A parachute school

group. And they had been

associated or involved with various other Cuban

organizations to try

to get tied up with, and it all

boiled down to one thing. The money. Who had the

Right.

Mr. Triplett. Was that a subsidiary of your

was the relationship?

any

relationship because they went off and did their own

thing, really. You know, after that they did their

own thing.

And I personally, like I say, I don't recall

when Bucanhan decided well, go ahead and use the

Mr. Triplett. What was the funding of the

International Anti-Communist Brigade?

The Witness. No funding at all. Completely

I probably said that a little

Were there any activities of the Brigade

conducted whatsoever?

The Witness. As an organization at that

time,

no.

MI. Triplett. Well, what was the purpose of

the Brigade?.

The Witness. As I said before, the purpose of

the Brigade was to get a group of Cubans and at that

to get these Americans to be available

But I decided that I couldn't handle these

people and I disassociated myself with Patrick and

his

group. They were uncontrolable.

Mr. Triplett.

Was it a corporation? You mentioned

Mr.

Sanstrom was involved in it.

The Witness..: It's very easy to find out. I

think possibly it was formed as a corporation to try

to arrange money legally. And like. I said before,

there was no money to be raised.

MI. Triplett. Okay.

If it was a corporation or even if it was a

partnership, it would require more than one person

as the organizer, Who else organized it with you?

Whose names were on it?

The Witness. To be honest with you, my mind

is blank on that. If it was a corporation and

legally incorporated, Tallahassee would have the

papers and the people's names on it.

Mr. Triplett. How long were you with the

organization before you turned it over to. Bucanhan?

The Witness. Well I didn't exactly turn it

over. I just let it ride and told Bucanhan, oh,

forget it. So he more or less started it up himself

and made himself the Secretary General of the

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

For how long were you involved with it? weeks,

months, years?

The Witness. No. Not that long. The Brigade,

it may have been a year possibly, that I wanted to

go ahead and be involved with it. But like I say,

I just lost interest in

the whole thing because of

a lack of funding.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever been contacted by

any person for the purpose of killing somebody in

this country?

The Witness.

Yes,

sir.

Mr. Triplett. By whom?

•The Witness. At that time, a CIA agent.

Mr. Triplett. And who was the agent?

The Witness. Do I have to tell you? well, I've

got nothing to hide. I'm sorry I even said that.

The year, I don't recall the year, but I don't

know whether I called this party or the party called

me. Anyway we

got together and in getting together,

I was either asked at his home or at a restaurant,

whether I would be interested in doing a domestic

assassination. And that surprised me.

Can you put it in a frame of

or after the Bay of Pigs?

I came from Cuba.: I don't recall what year. Whether

it was before of after the Bay of Pigs.

I honestly

don't recall.

I did tell Sam Jenis about this and he kind of

laughed and

said really, you've got to be kidding.

Well, find out:

So, I pursued it. . I told Barker, I said yes, I

would do it, a domestic assassination. But first I've

questioning me, well how would you go about it and

SO

forth. And I said hey, you know, it all depends

on who the party is.

SO

we went from there and I had à couple of

meetings with him pertaining to that. Then finally

I was told to pin him down and say hey, I will not

do it unless I get word from his control office.: And

that's. what

I did. I said, until your control officer

sits down with me and tells me

that he wants a domestic

assassination done, then I would do it. But through

you, no.. I want another verification from your control

officer.

He never came back.

Mr. Triplett. Did he ever talk to his control

officer?

The. Witness. Evidently he must have, because

he never mentioned it after that particular incident.

And I'd been in touch

with him up until the day of

Watergate, our problems with Watergate. And he never

came back and told me whether or not he wanted me to

go ahead and continue, you know, whatever the domestic

assassination was.. Because I said I want to know who

the party is, depending on how I would do it. If it's

going to be domestic, it's pretty hot stuff, you know.

So I told Barker, well, go to the Everglades,

you dig a hole, put lye in there and buryithe guy

or we!ll get an airplane of boat and do it out here

in the Gulf, you know, blow the boat up and so forth.

But I said before I actually do it, I want your

control officer to sit down with me and I want it

from his mouth that this is national security business.

And I would want to know who the party is, depending.

on how I would do this particular operation, you know.

got to that point.

In other words, after I told him, you know, that I

thing never developed into anything else.

•for that purpose?

The Witness. For that particular purpose who

contacted me to

go ahead and set this thing up? No

one at

all.

Just the Cuban

groups, you know, here

ourselves, trying to

go ahead and do penetration work

inside of Cuba. We were

going to try tó kill Fidel

naturally.

MI. Triplett. So it was a joint decision of

which you were a part?

The Witness. A joint decision.

MI. Triplett. Well, whose idea was it?

The Witness. Yeah, it was a joint decision to

go ahead and try to kill Castro naturally. Which

continues until this day. The only exception is

that I'm not involved today and haven't been for the

last number of years to do anything like that against

Castro.

attempting an assassination on Castro?

How many times? Well, going

back many years ago, I would think that after the

Bay of Pigs

invasion, maybe shortly after that, I

more or less lost interest because of not having

the proper financing

In order to do that you have

to have proper financing, to kill Fidel.

I'd say, the Bay of Pigs failed, and I may

have tried after 1963 because of the President's

assassination, because I was very bitter about that.

And I felt, from as early 1964, that the

President was assassinated, that Castro's intelligence

service was one of others that was behind the killing

of the President./And naturally my feeling was

continuous revenge against the friends that he

executed and would be feeling that he was involved

in the killing of the President.

Mr Triplett. So how many times did you attempt;

or plan to kill Castro?

The Witness. Oh, I would say about, not counting

the Marita Lorenz thing at

the very beginning. I would

say here in the United States, probably about two

times, two or three times, approximately.

Mr. Triplett.

And who else was involved with

you on these two or three occasions?

no. You know, straight out.

really nail these people.

MI. Triplett.

I'm talkingaabout you

specifically?

The witness. Myself specifically? Well, I

have heard through

my associations with

various

cubans in the past of wanting to go ahead and try

to, you know, kill them on certain visits that they

had taken from Cuba to certain other countries. But

for myself specifically to be involved in trying to

do it, I don't

recall that me myself did any planning

stage, you know, trying to kill Castro.

And to be honest with you, if there was a plan

to do it, I would certainly get myself involved because

I hate the man.

I would have no hesitation.

Mr. Triplett. In other words you're not

adverse. to that sort of plan? Even today? Is that

what you're saying?

The Witness.

Well, let me say this. I won't

say that because I'm much older today. Much older

and much wiser and you can't buck the system. And

if Uncle Sam

says don't touch the man, well then you

don't touch the man.

So I dón't touch him.:

Mr. Iriplett.

Okay.

Let's get back to the time when you were in

Cuba.

What relationships did you have, if any, with

the casinos, or the casino owners?

The Witness.: I believe at one of the Staff

meetings that I had with Castro, it was either at

the Air Force Base or the Prime Minister's office,

and it might have been as early as February, Castro

wanted me to help Pasternita Nunez, who was a woman

that was in the mountains with me, or I was with them

in the mountains.

She was a minister and all this

control came under her. So Fidel wanted me to help

her because of the confusion in Government that was

going on as early as February.

So I, representing the Cuban Government, assisted

Pasternita in the, well say control for the Government,

of the casinos.

I believe there was approximately,

maybe 22 casinos at that particular time.

My job

was, for Castro, to make sure, as he

was changing everything around, to make sure that

only a set amount of tables in each casino would be

operational and that each one of these tables had

to have the Government tax stamp on the tables. And

my job was to make sure that for instance, the Havana

Hilton was a big room there and they had X amount

of tables, roulette, black jack, this, that and so

forth, that they would have to have each table with

a

tax stamp, and my job was to make sure: that that was

Mr. Triplett: Had you, previous to that time,

ever worked in any of the casinos?

.*;

The Witness. I have never worked, nor have I

owned any gambling casinos in my whole life.

Mr. Triplett.. Had you ever worked for any

of the people who owned casinos at that time?

The Witness.

No. Never in my whole life. No.

None whatsoever. The only contact I ever had with

either casino operators or the management

is when I

would go on an inspection tour to inspect the tables

in the rooms and so forth for the Government. And

that wasn't too many times because I had my other

duties.

MI. Triplett:

so you're saying you were

essentially an inspector and tax regulator?

The Witness.

Yeah. To make

sure they keep

everything honest.

Mr. Triplett. Did you have any personal or

social connections with any of the people that were

involved with the

casinos?

Social, no. But I've had personal

contact with them because as I went to the casinos I

introduced myself, who I was. Naturally had to have

• my identification. I used to have my uniform on,

but after awhile Fidel said that anybody who would

go to the casinos -- that was one of the rules that

anybody in uniform had to keep out of the casinos

area, the gambling area.

They could go to the clubs.

but not in the gambling area. So I had to change

my clothes from my military uniform to my civilian

clothes and then I went and identified myself. Because

used to

go to the casinos and go up to the crap

table and I'd grab, if somebody would roll the dice,

I would grab the dice and I would look

at the dice

and I would say excuse me, I'm just checking the dice

and so forth. These are things I would do. They would

be very angry at me for doing it.

MI. Triplett.

How did you go about checking

the dice?

The Witness. Well, I know something, a little

bit.

With the dice, you know, they could be shaved

and have mercury in them where they would fall a certain

way and so forth and they could switch dice and so

forth, and I wasn't really up to that. Because Fidel

asked

me to come to the United States, if possible,

to

go ahead and get some people who knew about

and who knew about how to do the roulette wheel, you

go ahead and do that, but unfortunately I didn't have

time to do that, to

get the proper people to work for

the Cuban Government in order that the tables would be,

you know, operated in a legal manner.

And naturally there came a day where Fidel

ordered me to go ahead and close the casinos for ten

days, which he wanted to put them out of business,

which he did do for ten days.

Mr. Triplett. And you personally closed the

casinos for ten days?

The Witness. Well, I notified the casino -- I

did not notify the casino operators -- but I notified

the inspectors that the casinos were going to be

closed on a certain day. So naturally, Pasternita

Nunez, who was the minister,

sent out the memorandum

form to the casino operators that the casinos were

going to be closed. And they

got furious about it.

When the order came about, that day it was

closed, naturally inspectors with troops went to the

casinos and made sure that the doors were locked and

nobody could enter the casino rooms to do

gambling.

Then the next thing that followed that actually,

was big demonstrations of the families of the casino

because they had a union there.

So. they had a

peaceful demonstration and Fidel was forced, ten

days later, to reopen the casinos.

MI. Triplett. Did any of the casino owners

personally complain to you?

The Witness. No.

During this period of time

I had no contact with the casino operators because

again I was involved in these other things that I

was doing for the Cuban Government.

MI. Triplett. But you were occasionally at

the casinos inspecting?

The Witness. Oh, yeah.

Mr. Triplett.: So you at least knew them?

The Witness. I knew some of them, yeah. Because

there were so many, people who had pieces of the operation

or whatever.

MI. Triplett. So did any of them ever complain

to you of this ten day closing?

The Witness. Well: I, at one time, had a

meeting with Fidel, a Staff meeting, and Fidel told

me that he was going to close the casinos. He was

going to run the God-Damned gangsters out of Cuba.

This

is what he told me.

hey, Fidel is going to go ahead and close the casinos

Well,.I can say one of them wa's

Santos Trafficante one time.. I was at the -- what

sister was

there with this movie actor, John -- the one who

played Wild Bill Hickcock -- so she called me over.

Fidel's younger sister. And

I sat down and Trafficante came over and I got up

because I knew he was one of the operators of this

particular casino. And so I got aside with him and

•I told him, I said, Mr. Trafficante, I had a meeting

with Castro and he said he was going to go ahead and

nationalize all American business interests and he

was going to run the God-Damned gangsters, or the

gambling operators out of Cuba.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

the things were closed.

Mr. Triplett.. When they were closed, did any

of the owners or operators complain to you about the

closing?

The Witness.

No. Because I had no further

contact with them. When they were reopened again

I was seeing to my duties elsewhere. They were so

heavy on me, that my inspectors continually worked

throughout the casinos, all the different casinos.

Mr. Triplett.. How long were you actually a

casino inspector?

The Witness. Well I would say from February

üntil June when I left.

That was it. Because I

left the 30th of June, 1959.

Mr. Triplett. When you left the 30th of

June, that was

sometime after the ten day closing

you previously described?

The Witness: Oh, yeah, sure.

Mr. Triplett. During this period of five

or so months that you were

a casino inspector, did

you have occasion to make any deals with any of

the operators or owners of the casinos?

The Witness. I never made any deals whatsoever

with anyone. None whatsoever. Because when I came

over here, you must understand, my activities here did

Mr. Triplett. Did you receive

The Witness.

NO.

Never.

Mr. Triplett. Did anybody offer you any favors

The Witness.

NO.

I would not be in this situation today, the

way I am, if I did. Because I understand that people

who deal with them have

good connections and I am,

throughout this whole thing with Watergate, in a

very very bad financial situation. All this publicity

since Watergate, with the JFK situation, have left

me at a very very bad situation financially.

Otherwise, I have had tremendous positions

offered me, but unfortunately because of the exposure

that I have received throughout all of this, it has

denied me really to earn a decent living. And if I

had mob connections, believe me, then I would be all

right.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever heard of somebody

called Stretch Rubin?

The Witness. Oh, yeah. Sure.

MI. Triplett.. How

did that happen?

The Witness. Well, I was in my jeep with some

of my bodyguards and i

saw a commotion right near

the Casa Grande Hotel.

I stopped because.I

heard

this American raising a lot of hell and so förth;

and I stopped and I jumped out of my jeep between

my bodyguards.

These were. Barbudas (phonetic).

I asked them what's happening here? They said

well, he's one of these gangsters here and so forth

and Rubin is hollering, you know, "They are going

to kill me, they are going to shoot me."

•^.

So I went over and says wait a minute, like

what's the problem here?

And he

said look I just left the business

over here, and he had two bags of money.: I said!

did you steal anything, or what? He said, no. He

said I checked the slot machines.

They had a

gambling .room at the Casa Grande Hotel.

So I told the Barbudas, I says look --

told

him, look, these

people. are not going

• to kill you. I

says as a matter of fact I am going to take you with me,

you know, so you will be all right.

That is what I did.

Mr. Triplett. By the way, I presume Stretch

I do not know.

Mr. Triplett. All you know is Stretch rubin?

The Witness. Stretch Rubin, right.

Mr. Triplett. Did you subseguently see Mr.

Rubin on occasion after that?

Yes."

Mr. Triplett. Did he introduce you to any of

Remember, this is santiago, Cuba. The next time

I saw him was when I

got to Havana and they came over

to the Air Force to see me because I toldöthem I was

they came over to the Air Force to see me.

The Witness. Yes. He was facinated with the

fact that I washan American officer with the Rebel

forces, especially with Fidel. That day they came

out to see me, Fidel came in with a helicopter and

he landed and Fidel saw me at a distance, and

naturally they were there to see me; and Fidel

walked over with his entourage and saw me and

gave

me

an embrazo, you know.

So they were highly

impressed.

The fact, you know, Fidel and here's

this American, a Rebel officer. And Fidel left

after that.

Mr. Triplett. Did Stretch Rubin introduce

you to anybody else?

The Witness.

Well, from that time -- let's

see.

this was in January. Then remember I didn't

have anything to do with -- no, I did not have anything

to do with the gambling at that time. Because it

came later.. In February.

But in February, what Hymie did, and stretch

both, they said I am going to introduce you to some

of the operators when you identify yourself to them,

which

I did because I saw them at casinos.

So I am

not sure which casino it was. I saw them at one

casino and naturally they introduced me to one of the

The Witness. I forget off-hand who it was.

So they mentioned, this is Frank Fiorini. He

is Fidel's right-hand man. In charge of this. I mean,

this is how this thing went around.

so I got to know

who was who, you know, and

I made my report when I

got back to my office with Pasternita, because they

really didn't know who was who and so forth. Because

many of the documents that they had concerning, you

know the ministry concerning the casinos, many of them

were missing. So we had to

go ahead and find out

who was involved in the Hilton operation, who was

involved in the Nationale, who was involved in the

Capri, who was involved in the thing. You know, we

had to go in and try to

Mr. Triplett.

Levine that took me to see

Dominic Bartone. But

now Hymie Levine, over the past years, I have been

is, Hymie came here from Cuba himself and stayed

yes.

Mr. Triplett. And what type of

associations?

The Witness. Well, while I was in jail, just

before I

got out of jail on the watergate thing, I

was in the Dade County jail, where

I got released here.

A friend of mine came to see me and wanted to get in

touch with the CIA. And I looked at him and I said,

you got to be crazy. I am in jail. How am I going

to get in touch with the CIA for you? I said, tell

me what it is about?

He said well, Frank, it is National security

business

outside the country.

I said well, you are going to have to wait

until I get out. Which, in a few days I dia

get out

here. So when I did get out he made contact with me

over at my home. His name was Jerry Bucanhan.

MI. Triplett. Jim Bucanhan's brother?

The Witness.

Yes. Jim Bucanhan's brother.

Jerry Bucanhan®

So I made contact with a Mi. McVaine (phonetic) •

MI. Triplett.

What was his first name? Do you

recall?

No.: I forget his first name.

is only one MoVaine because

that's a code name that

they use. There's only one agent that uses that

particular code name.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

The Witness. And in the process

of that,

making contact with McVaine, I

got a call from the

Senate Watergate Committee, which I had to go to

Washington, D.C. and I was questioned again over

the same thing just like I am

going over the same

thing here, the Rockerfeller Committee and so forth

questioned me. And then finally the punch line came,

have you been in touch with CIA since you have been

out of jail? And I said, yes, I have. Who? And I

said well, it pertained to National security business.

So why don't you get in touch with these people and

find out, you know,: because I do not even know what

kind of National security business it is. I have

not even had time to make the personal contact, you

know.

23,

24

25

SO I

was instructed by the CIA stationed here

that any of the Watergate people could not have any

personal contact with the local CIA stationed here.

Any contact with CIA would have to be done through

Langley, Virginia. So they slamed the door in my

face here.

Bucanhan was with me..

And Mr. Bucanhan spelled out

everything.",It had to do with international drụg

smuggling.

So I told them, I says, well, I am turning him

over to you people because that is out of my line,

which I did.

So a meeting was set up with U.s. Customs and

the DEA for Jerry Bucanhan to do what he had to do

with

.. them. And that is it.

Mr. Triplett. And is that the only contact you

But that is it more of less.

Mr.

tripiett. well, a few other things. what

few other things? Have you been investigated?

The Witness. No, not' as an informant because

I am not registered with those people. But there are

other people that I did, have made contact with these

people, to work with these people.

Mr. Triplett.: Are you familiar with the name

Kenneth Bernstein?

The Witness.

Yes.

Mr. Triplett.

And what is your association

with him?

The Witness. I have no personal association

with him. This is where Jerry Bucanhan comes in

because he worked on that case.

Mr. Triplett.

Bernstein was with DEA?

The Witness

Bernstein, at the beginning, was

not with DEA, but because of the investigation that

Jerry Bucanhan was doing as an undercover agent for

DEA and U.S. Customs, this is where Bernstein at a

later date

was

recruited by DEA and so forth. You

would have to look at the record on that because I

Mr. Triplett.

Are you familiar with the name

The Witness. Certainly.

Yes:

Mr. Triplett. And what is. your association

of knowledge of him?

The Witness.

Steve Czukas is a U.S. Customs

investigator:

Mr. Triplett. Is that also the person you

contacted with respect to Customs?

The Witness.

Yes:

Mr. Triplett. "Have

you had any other dealings

with Mr. Czukas other than this one you related?

The Witness:

Any time that any information --

yes,

I have, pertaining to information concerning

Cuban terrorists, that I felt a lot of it was

done

by cuban intelligence and so forth, in order

that

CIA would have a hand in it.

This was international.

That they would be advised of it through Steve Czukas.

Mr. Triplett. Now when you talk about Cuban

terrorists, are you talking about any Cuban

terrorist,

or just pro-Castro Cuban terrorists?

The Witness. I am talking about the pro-Castro

Cuban

terrorists because I am not aware of all the

terrorists activity that's going on in this area.

Because. I am not in that business

'I am not in the

business of investigations of anything like that at

the present time. But any time I would gather some

information through friends of mine, like CIA fellows

who were 'Cubans, this information, if I felt that it

was essential to the Government, then I would turn

certain people over, make introductions to certain

people to steve Crukas who in turn, if they had to

go ahead and take them to either the DEA or U.S.

Customs or FBI Or CIA.

He

was. my "contact with the

Federal Agencies to turn these people and the

information over to them and I kept out of it.

Because I maintained to them that much of the drụg

smuggling in this country here, which is slowly;

Castro is behind it. A lot of the drug smuggling

has something to do with the terrorist activities

that has been going on here.

So these things I am concerned of, which I

consider National

security to this country.

And

because I, myself, would not want to be directly

involved in any of these things as far as, you know,

being the informant of

anything like that. I made

the connection for these people to go see steve, go

see this, go see that. Get in touch with him, and

then they were,

on their own. I kept out of it.

Mr. Triplett. Okay:

•Again, why did you use Steve Czukas as a go-

between?

The Witness. Because he had contacts with CIA.

MI. Triplett. To your knowledge was he a CIA

agent or employee?

The Witness.

Steve. Czukas? To my knowledge,

I do not know.

The only thing I know about Steve

Czukas, he is a very influential man with the U.s.

Customs for many years and even though his capacity

is not as an official of that, but he holds great

influence and personally I like him. Tremendous man.

Mr. Triplett.. Are you familiar with Cesar

Diosdado?

The Witness. I have heard of him.: I am not

sure if I am familiar with him or not.

MI. Triplett. Have you had any dealings with

the Immigration and Naturalization Service?

The Witness.

Yes.

Mr Triplett. What type of dealings was that?

The Witness. I had my citizenship taken away

from me in the early '60's when I came from Cuba.

It was because of all the attempts against Castro and

my activities against Castro, which I did not know at

that time the American Government did not want these

so naturally, not knowing

this, the Government put pressure on me.

I went with Marcus Diez Lanz to go to Guatemala

to speak with President: yaigoras in Guatemala. And

evidently the Cuban Intelligence service found out

that Diez Lanz and myself were there and we were

eating dinner and here it comes over the television

in the dining room, it

showed my picture and Diez

Lanz' picture, that we were there for the United

States, which was not true, for the United States

that we leave Guatemala because of the international

pressure that was

going on by our presence there and

us talking with President Ydigoras. So naturally

we left.

Marcus Diez Lanz decided on his return trip

to the United States we would

go by way of Mexico

in order to arrange for his reentry, or whatever

he had to do, and people he had to see in Mexico,

and I would leave Guatemala directly to Miami.

Because there was some shit in Washington

White who is the presiding officer for the Immigration,

not knowingly every time I had to go there, the

Government, with the Federal Attorney, popped it out,

he says well, Mr. Sturgis is no longer a citizen of

the United States. Here is a paper, a document signed

by the Secretary of State taking away MI. Sturgis'

citizenship.

Well, this little Guinnie (phonetic) here blew

his stack.' And I said,:

all you queers up in

Washington, D.C. in the State Department -- believe

me, on record, on tape there. And I apologized to

Mr. White. And I looked at that Federal prosecutor

and I says, you, and I said if you fall into it with

those queers up there that

you represent, and believe

me, I was

so upset that my lawyer was holding me down.

And I used every filthy word in the language. Take

my citizenship away? Illegal.

I, contacted Mr. George Smathers, Senator Smathers.

Mr.

Smathers contacted the State Department and wrote

a lettey saying you mean to tell me, at the stroke

of a pen, that you took the citizenship of this World

War II hero -- I don't know if I'm a hero or not --

at a stroke of your pen?

He says, well, you know, documents are put in

not like that.

And he said, bull shit it is not like

about it. He says, if they do not give you your

in to the Congress or the Senate and you will get your

citizenship back. And I

got it back eventually.

But can you imagine

Not too long. Because naturally

when I had lost my contacts inside. of Cuba -- because

I was going back and forth - naturally that was the

end of the business.:

Because of my. connections in

Cuba. The

fact that my position in Cuba was totally

after you closed

here, we contacted - when I say we, sometimes I

was with them, sometimes I was not with them -- they

who gave money, they had an office here and their

It was one of the biggest newspapers in Havana at

that time and they came into exile. And, what's

the name of this magazine, Spanish magazine? The

biggest one in Cuba. And they gave money to the

Diez Lanz'.

And these are the monies that we more or less

lived on in order to continue our resistence, you know,

against the Castro Government.

MI. Triplett.

So essentially you were

supporting

yourself by either planning or carrying out raids

against Cuba at that time? That was your source of

No.

Mr. Triplett. Then in september, 1961, you.

incorporated the Hampton Roads Salvage

Company?

The Witness.

Of Florida.

Mr. Triplett.

With Pedro and Marcus Diez Lanz.

What was the nature of that business?

The Witness.: Well, we tried to do some salvage

work. Buying and selling of boats and so forth.

At the same time it was to be used in the

operations against Cuba.

Funding for that corporation came from the exile

community who did have contact with the Government.

I,

myself directly, had nothing to do with receiving

the funds personally, but the Diez Lanz brothers did

receive the funds which was put in the account for

Hampton Roads Salvage Company.

Four boats were bought. A PC boat wäs bought.

Another boat called the lusa was bought. Two moppies

(phonetic) were bought from Bertrum's Yacht Company

and these boats were used -- primarily the idea of

the company, was to be used in CIA operations.

My boat -- well, our boat -- this one moppy, went

on numerous operations where another friend gf mine, a

was what the company was used for.

Mr. Triplett. Primarily for CIA operations?

The Witness. Well, let me say, primarily for

us to make a living. Even though it was funded by

the Cuban business community, but CIA had use of these

boats.

you know. I could not nail down the specific

employment I had at that particular time.

But I was

continually doing, I know, operations and again

receiving financing from the Cuban business colony.

you have occasion to sell stories to newspapers and

magazines?

Yes.

Mr. Triplett. Do you recall

and magazines?

The Witness. Not off-hand, no.

Mr. Triplett. Have you maintained any income

records for the period of say 1950 to the present?

work I paid my taxes when I did work. I paid my

taxes. So I would have some records when I did work.

Then I went to work with a friend of mine called

The

Yes.

MI. Triplett. What exactly was your relationship

during the early 1960's with Marlona Artime?

The Witness. Well, I knew Marlona Artime.

Marlona Artime came out of Cuba working with the CIA.

He went into South America and then he came up to --

because we more or less

founded here in exile, the

MrR movement and with the funds that, the MRR movement

was getting from Central Intelligence Agency, one

of the

safe houses that we had was on Brickell Avenue,

and Marlona occasionally came there to Brickell Avenue

because we used that as an office.

And many of the

Cuban exiles

who worked for the Agency and did not

work for the Agency, coming out of Cuba, this was the

first place they would come to, the Brickell Avenue

safe house.

Mr. Triplett. Now you say Marlona Artime came

out of Cuba working for the CIA.

To your knowledge,

was he working

for the CIA before he left Cuba?

As a matter of fact when Marita Lorenz made

these accusations. and I went to New York and I was

ärrested by the New York Police Department, and I

was released on bond, I immediately told my Attorney,

that I wanted to take a polygraph examination.

In the past, I volunteered to take á polygraph

examination with the Watergate Committee, with the

Rockerfeller Committee, and volunteered with every

committee to take a polygraph.

Now here, with this mess that Marita Lorenz

created, I

asked my lawyer, I want to take a polygraph.

And I did take a polygraph and i passed the polygraph.

Mr. Triplett. Well, when you say you passed,

you are telling us that the finding

was that you were

not deceptive in your answers?

That is right. And if you would

like to ask me questions of what I was asked and what

my answers

were, I would be very happy to tell you.

STREET,

Let me ask you specifically, did you, in the

company of Marita Lorenz, Leon Oswald and others,.

drive to Dallas a day or two before the assassination?

The Witness. Sir, that is an absolute lie. I

have never been with Marita lorenz and Osie, as she

calls him, or with Pedro Diez Lanz, of Marcus Diez

Lanz, or "Dy: Orlando Bosch, or Jerry Patrick, which

she claimed all of us besides some other Cubans, were

in two automobiles and left Miami, Florida two days

before the assassination of the President of the

United

States.

She is a liar. I took a polygraph

examination to that effect that I have never been

involved in any conspiracy to kill the president of

the United States, nor did

I kill the President of

the United States, not was I with her at any

time

conspiring to kill the President of the United States,

nor was I with her in any automobile with these people

Of any other people going to Dallas to plot to kill

the President of the United States.

She is an absolute

Mi. Triplett. Very good:

Thank you.

At any time during the year 1963, were you in

Dallas, Texas?

The witness. I have went, because of operations

that I had been doing and so forth, traveled through

Texas into Mexico, into Central America, in and out.

And I would say yes, sir, I probably have been through

nöt only Dallas, but other cities in Texas.

Mr. Triplett. Now specifically around June

Yes, sir.

or July of '63, dia you go to Dallas: for the purpose

of purchasing weapons?

The Witness. I have never been to Dallas where

•I stayed at any particular instance in order to buy

any weapons or anything in Dallas or anyplace in Texas.

Anytime I went through Têxas it was strictly

transient.

Mr. Triplett.

Your answer begs a question a

little bit.

Whether or not you stayed in Dallas for

the purpose of buying weapons. Did you ever go to

Dallas to buy weapons around June or July of '63?

lying son-of-a-bitch.

But in the past, yes. Because in Cuba, he was

there as a

Yes.

But I have

of them are that way.

Mr. Triplett.

So, you are saying that from

at least June 1960 until, the early 1970's, you did

not see Andrew St. George?

The Witness: Not to my knowledge. In all those

years I have not seen Andrew St. George.

piu:

Mr. Triplett. Has he ever tape recorded an

interview with you?

The Witness. It is possible. I don't know.

I'm not sure. I do not think so. At least I am not

aware of it.:

Mr. Triplett.

Have you talked with him over

the phone during that same period?

The Witness. Yes.

MI.

Triplett. How many occasions?

The Witness.

On a number of occasions. He was

trying to get me to sign a contract to write a book.

And because of my feelings of his underhanded ways of

going about it and with him not wanting to

have my

Attorney look over the contract, i did not

sign a

contract with him. So I blew the deal.

Mr. Triplett. Now have you personally had

occasion to investigate the various allegations

regarding the assassination of John F. Kennedy?

me. + But what monies I did have and so

forth, in buying certain books and researching them,

these people have shown me and given me, I have: tried

by best to show that there was a link between Ruby

and Oswald, which would show that there was a

conspiracy to kill the President of the United States.

MI. Triplett. Have you worked with, or

cooperated with Jack Anderson in any of these

investigative efforts?

The Witness.

Well, when

you say worked, no.

I have never worked for Jack Anderson.

Mr. Triplett. Have you provided information

to him; possibly the results of your own investigative

efforts?

The

Witness. Well I would say Jack and I have

Pedro Diez Lanz, and he was trying to help us. He

it, because of my close connection in the Cuban colony.

I am aware of a number of things that goes on in a

number of the countries, especially in Cuba.

Where it comes that Cuba is involved in many

things,. I will go out to see my friends who give me

information because we try to keep up. to date on the

Cuban situation in this hemisphere.

asked me certain things which I will not give Jack,

The Witness. No, sir, I have not.

As a matter of fact when I came from Cuba years

ago, Jack Anderson thought I might be a good asset

to the CIA and wanted me to be introduced to an Admiral

who at the time was a high ranking CIA official, and

I refused.

Because of my involvement here naturally.

You are talking

about CIA assets here, or the anti-Castro Cubans?

that were involved.

Did you ever

conduct an investigation into

the assassination of John F. Kennedy?

The Witness.

As much as I could on my own,

you know, my own financial status in the last number

of years. Naturally, by talking with friends of

mine who have past CIA connections.

Mr. Triplett. Was any of this ever in

neonjunction with E. Howard Hunt?

The

Witness. No. No, sir.

MI. Triplett. Did you ever do any investigation

into the assassination as far back as 1964?

•The Witness. Well, as far back as 1964, this

turmoil of the President being assassinated naturally,

you know, had a

great effect on us here in the Cuban

exile colony. So naturally we tried to go ahead and

get all the information that we possibly could.

And the information that I have received was

that Castro's Intelligence Service was involved in

the

assassination.

Mr. Triplett. And did you turn that information

over to the Warren Commission

at that time?

The Witness. No, sir. The information that

was turned over by my friends were turned over to a

I forget. I think he worked --

I couldn't exactly tell you the correct name because

I could be wrong and you know, I

don't know, but he

did work with

the Government.

Whether it was

internal security, but we did know that he had

somewhat of

an involvement eyen before the Bay of

Pigs invasion, you know. He was a conduit, let's

say, for the

Government in this

area here.

And I could possibly go as far as saying that

Mi. Tarabuchi also was a person who might have been

in touch with the Dade County, you know, the local

law enforcement agencies for the Federal Government

at that time.

MI. Triplett.. You say there was an involvement

by Cuban Intelligence in the assassination? Is that

what you said?

The Witness.

• Yes, sir..

Mr. Triplett.

On what evidence do'you base

that?

was somehow involved with Cuban intelligence? In

what way?

The Witness.

Well, when' I say it was mostly

hearsay, for instance, Oswald left the United States

so easily to

go into Russia, when at that particular

time it was so difficult for any foreigner to get

into Russia, and difficult for any Russians to leave

Russia. Here, Oswald had an easy entry into Russia;

Oswald spent approximately two, two and a half years

in Russia; he spent his time in Minsk where there

was an intelligence school there for Cuban intelligence

officers.

We believed at that particular time, and

I believe until this present day, that Oswald's

contact was with the Cuban Intelligence Service because

of this school that was there.

He left Russia so easily! taking a Russian wife

whose uncle was a high ranking intelligence officer.

Took his child. that was born in Russia so easily and

came back:

One or two people who had an association with

the

American Embassy made contact with Oswald in

Russia, which I believe either work for the Central

Intelligence Agency, or they were briefed before

talking with Oswald, or briefed after the interview

with Oswald. Again, Oswald coming into the United

A great deal of money.

And all these, with some evidence pertaining

to this association and the connection between Ruby

and oswald, with the evidence that was turned over

tö the FBI in Dallas by individuals who had physical

control of this evidence, the FBI sent it to headquarters

in Washington, getting a receipt that this evidence

was put in the National Archives. And that eventually

when the FBI returned, and other people investigating

the assassination finding out about this evidence,

went to the Archives to find this evidence which

linked Oswald and Ruby, this evidence completely

disappeared.

investigating the National Archives have found that

opposed to

specific that indicates to you, above and beyond what

we

have in the books, that yes, Cuban Intelligence

was involved as opposed to other possible -- well, I'll

The

Witness.: In Havana, Cuba.

Mr.

Triplett. And would you please relate what

occurred at that meeting, or those meetings?

; &

The Witness. Well, he came to meet me because

he heard about me being with the Castro forces and

he introduced himself to me and that was it, really.

Then

I think he got in some trouble in Havana.

And the reason why he got in trouble in Havana was

because he was black marketing, selling Cuban money.

Buying

and selling Cuban money. That is why he was

arrested.

And that is all I know about Martino except

he came to the United States and I believe he did come

over to my house at 60th court at another time and

so forth.

That is the only thing I remember.

Mr. Triplett. What happened when he came to

your house?

The Witness. I don't know. I said I believe

that he probably came over to my house. Because I

had a lot of people come

over to see Pedro and myself.

Again, you can talk about something and unless

you have got the funding, you can't do nothing.

Okay. So he discussed it with

you and so you discussed it with him, right?

Well, he discussed it with me.

you ever have any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald or

have any knowledge of his attempting to contact you

or your organization?

The Witness.

Well, before the assassination

of the President of the United States -- this is

where the confusion comes

in because Jeiry Bucanhan

told me -- Jerry Bucanhan, how I met him was part

of the Jerry Patrick group of many Americans

and

Canadians that was in this area.

Mr. Triplett. The Jerry: Patrick group.

For

organization?

The

Witness.

well, the group before he had

Interpen.

There was a group of Americans that lived

Öff of 17th Avenue in some woman's house, a nice:

woman's house and so forth.

And Jerry Patrick was -- I mean rather, Jerry

Bucanhan was part of this group with the Masferer

people.

And Jerry Bucanhan seemed to be a real nice

kid.

He was a young kid. And I used to tell him,

L00k, Rolando Masferer is not the type of people

for you to be with because if this man ever goes to

Cuba, you have the Cuban people that don't like him

and naturally they are not going to like you because

of his reputation under the Batista regime.

So this is how I got to meet Jerry Bucanhan:

Now I forgot what the question was.

Mr. Triplett. Whether or not there was any

approach to you or your organization by Lee Harvey

Oswald.

The Witness.

oh. So with his brother, Jim

Bucanhan being a newspaper man up there at the

Sun Sentinenallin Fort Lauderdale, Jerry spoke to

me one day and mentioned the fact, after the

assassination, he

mentioned the

fact to me, he says

well, he says there is a possibility that Oswald was

down here in this area trying to infiltrate the Cuban

exile groups here before the assassination. But there

was nothing definite.

Because I found out through

my own connections and so forth that Oswald was not

down in this area, at least that I knew of. That he

was not down in this area and

I that he tried to go

ahead and infiltrate our group and other Cuban groups.

There was a student directorate group that was

operating

here also and they have made statements to

the effect, and also to us, that there was a possibility

that Oswald -- now there might have been a communication

gap there because they had their group also down

there in New Orleans, you know, and that Oswald

possibly would have been in this area here.

So this is where it came about that oswald was

possibly in this area trying to infiltrate the Cuban

exile groups:

MI. Triplett: Well, aside from the word that

was essentially just around that he might have been

in the area trying to infiltrate, do you know of

anybody that said yeah, I saw him trying to infiltrate,

ör saw him in the area?

The Witness®

well Jerry told me

that he thought

he had a fight with him.

MI. Triplett. Jerry Bucanhan?

The Witness.

Jerry Bucanhan.

Mr. Triplett.:: Or Jerry Patrick?

The Witness.

No. Jerry Bucanhan. That is

what he told me.

Mr. Triplett. Upon what did he base that?

The withessI don't know;

Maybe because of

the times and with the possibility of the information

going in the Cuban colony, that there was a possibility

that Oswald was in this area.

But we found out later

that it was not so.

Mr. Triplett:

And how did you find that out?

The Witness. Through word of mouth.. Through

our people in the Cuban colony.

Not only that, the Federal Agents in this area.

You know, when the assassination occurred, you could

imagine, everybody in this area, from the local police

department to the Dade County Sheriff's Department,

to

every Federal Agency in this area here, was on

alert doing their own investigation into, you know,

this assassination. Doing their own private

investigation. And we could find nothing in this

area.

And I think the CIA boys in this area at that

time were asked about Oswald being in this area and

so forth.

Because many of my friends again, for

instance line Salvadore Garcia, who worked

for the

Agency and who gave me certain documents to turn

over to the committees and so forth that tried to

show the link between oswald and Ruby, also -- like

say, there was no way to find out. No proof.

You

know, strong proof that Oswald was in the area.

Mr. Triplett.

Let me ask you, you know, I have

run through a lot of names and I have got a few more.

The Witness. Go ahead.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever had any association

ever met David Moralez (phonetic)?

Mr. Triplett. It is our understanding that he

also was known as Elino (phonetic). He was a Mexian

American.

The Witness. Like I say, it sounds very familiar.

There is a possibility. I'm not sure and I can't

put in my mind where I heard the name, or if I met

this person.

Mr. Triplett. All right.

How about a Giffrey Pinchot?

The Witness. Is that how you pronounce it?

How do you spell that last name?

Mr. Triplett. P-i-n-c-h-o-t.

The Witness.' p-i-n-c-h-o-t? I'm not sure.

I'm thinking again with Alex Roark introducing me

to somebody in New York that had some name that

started with a "p" on the end of that. And I'm not

sure of the phrasing of the name. An elderly man.

At that time he was an elderly man.

Mr. Triplett. Who was this person you were

introduced to in New York?

I'm not sure really who he was.

I, am not sure, really.

Because Alex

introduced me to a lot of people in New York. Not

a"lot, but a number of people in New York. Because

he wanted to introduce them

to me because of my

being a Rebel officer in Cuba.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever met a Ricardo

Moralez?

The Witness.. I'm not sure of the name. I'm

not sure of it.

Mr. Triplett.

Ricardo Moralez. The nickname

would have been Elmono?

The Witness.

'Elmono?. Oh, the monkey? Moralez

the monkey? I'm not sure. Believe me, I'm not sure.

But I know who he is. I think maybe I did meet the

monkey.

Moralez is the one who is in Venezuela. He

was the one that got in a fight with another friend,

not a friend, an acquaintence that I know by the name

of Mavaretti (phonetic). As a

matter of fact he

shot

Mavaretti: Mavaretti is in prison today.

Moralez is the guy that is in Cuba today. I

think he is Chief of Airport Security there. All the

Cubans know who he is.

Mr. Triplett. What, if any, association did you

have with him?

with them, you know, if they're friends of mine.

past, met him in the past.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever had occasion to

form a church?

of God.

Mr. Triplett. When was this?

The Witness. This was before Watergate. My

intentions

of this church, because of the nature of

me being with the special intelligence unit, I felt

that once I would be, you know, after these particular

operations, I

wanted, to go

ahead and raise funds and

put missions in certain Central American countries

ör South American countries

for the purpose of helping

the poor people in that area.

ButsI never. got around

to it because I went to jail and that flopped.

MI. Triplett. So the purpose of this church

was to raise money?

Yes. I would have to go ahead

and have a fund raising campaign. And I wanted Jim

I know you have brought some information with you.

And also it is customary when we have hearings
