Robert S. Anson, author of “They've Killed the

President! The Search for the Murderers of John F. Kennedy,"
offered a critical appraisal of Lee Harvey Oswald's travel
through Western Europe prior to his appearance in Moscow

on October’ 16, 1959. Anson expressed particular concern

over the issuance of a Soviet tourist visa in Helsinki,

Finland to oswala prior to his entry into the Soviet Union.
Anson wrote that "/o 7n Monday, October 12, Oswald went

to the Soviet Consulate and applied for a visa. It was
granted two days later” (Anson, p. 159)“ Anson concluded:

Oswald also managed to secure a Soviet
visa in record time. The CIA told the
Commission that under ordinary circum-
stances obtaining a visa in Finland
took one or two weeks; Oswald got his
in two days. (Ibid., p. 160)*  -—

* Anson was referring to the Warren Commission Report where it
is stated:

The Department of State has advised the Commission
that it has some information that in 1959 it usually
took an American tourist in Helsinki 1 to 2 weeks to
obtain a visa, and that it has other information that
the normal waiting period during the past 5 years has
been a week or less. According to the Department's
information, the waiting period has always varied fre-
quently and widely, with one confirmed instance in 1963
of a visa routinely issued in less than 24 hours. The
Central Intelligence Agency has indicated (continued)

Thus, the issue has arisen whether Oswald's receipt

of a Soviet visa prior to his entry into the Soviet Union
was an "odd happening". as Anson characterized it; circum-
stantial evidence tending to show that Oswald had received
special assistance in order to enter the Soviet Union.
During the course of its investigation the Warren Commission

shared Anson's concerns. In a letter to the CIA dated May

25, 1964 J. Lee Rankin ingtéred about the apparent speed
with which Oswald's Soviét visa was issued: Rankin noted

that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes of the

(| This information from the Department of State and the Central
Intelligence Agency thus suggests that Oswald's wait for a
visa may have been shorter than usual but not beyond the
range of possible variation. The prompt issuance of Oswald's
visa may have been merely the result of normal procedures,
due in part to the fact that the summer rush had ended.

It might also mean that Oswald was unusually urgent in his
demands that his visa be issued promptly. Oswald himself
told officials at the American Embassy in Moscow on October
31, when he appeared to renounce his citizenship, that he had
said nothing to the Soviets about defecting until he arrived
ie Moscow. In any event, the Commission has found nothing

Rankin also stated that from CIA material supplied

to the Warren Commission, the Commission had concluded

Saturday, October 10, 1959, and that Oswald had received
his Soviet tourist visa on Wednesday, October 14, 1959,
departing by train for the Soviet Union on October 15.* Ctoiad

INTOURIST. ‘(Richard Helms to J. Lee Rankin, DDP4-3916, 31
July 1964) A second communication from Helms to Rankin
dated September 14, 1964 added that during the 1964 tourist
season, Soviet Consulates in at least some Western European
cities issued Soviet tourist visas in from five to seven
days. (hetterd of Richard pong Lee Rankin, DDP4-4775,
14 September 1964) -
In an effort to. resolve this issue, the Committee
has reviewed qdsbhetmretas filef maintained by the CIA which
sheds further light on the circumstances surrounding issuance
of Oswald's Soviet tourist visa. Th¢@sCIA file concerns
Gregorly Golub, Soviet Consul in Helsinki ie the time Oswald
was issued his tourist visa. (CIA vocs(grua-3939,) 2 July
1959, ocoa-3745] 21 April 1959 [ orwa-4a32 Jo October 59)
Golub's file reveals that in addition to his Consular acti-
vities, he was believed to be an officer of the Soviet KGB.

[tocow-2907,] 26 June 1959p onn-2937] 21 September 1959)

Two dispatches from Helsinki concerning Golub

are of particular significance with regard to the time neces-
sary for issuance of visas to Americans for travel into the
Soviet Union.

The first dispatch records that Golub disclosed dur-

ing a luncheon conversation that:

“Moscow had given him the authority to

The second[”_|Dispatch dated October 9, 1959, one
day prior to Oswald's arrival in Helsinki, illustrates
that Golub did have the authority to issue visas without
delay. The Dispatch discusses telephone contact between
Golub and his Consular counterpart at the American Embassy

in Helsinki. In part the Dispatch discloses:

Golub has only phoned -(the US consul) once
and this was on a business matter. Two
Americans were in the Soviet Consulate at
the time and were applying for Soviet visas
thru (sic.) Golub. They had previously
been in the American consulate inquiring
about the possibility of obtaining a Soviet
visa in one or two days. (The U.S. Consul)
advised them to go directly to Golub and
make their request, which they did. Golub
phoned (the U.S. Consul) to state that he
would give them their visas as soon as they
made advance Intourist reservations. When

they did bean Golub, [AMGdehem /

* The Dispatch does not define the meaning given by Golub
to the term “all right."

upon his arrival at Moscow railroad station on October 16, he
was met by an Intourist representative and taken to the Hotel
