Mr. Walter Elder |

Review Staff

Central Intelligence Agency
Langley, Virginia :

Dear Walt: .

“This letter will confirm verbal requests_made b Mr Dwyer
‘of the Senate Select Committee staff to Mr. re~
‘garding materials pertaining to the assassination of President
°. Kennedy. : 1

‘ : $ F Parsee :
1. The Senate Select Committee requests a listing of all Mexico
City Station personnel for the period of September through
WW December 1963. -The Committee requests this.list on an access
basis only, to be retained at the CIA for use by the Committee
' staff. : :
2. The Senate Select Committee requests clarification on what
documents were filed in the Oswald 201 as of November 22, 1963.
Both Mr. Hartman and Mr..Wall, CI Staff, have stated there were z
five documents in the file: two Department of State Foreign Dis-
‘ patches ‘(FS Dispatch. #806 dated May 5, 1961 and FS Dispatch $317
dated December 12, 1961); one Office of Naval Intelligence memor-
andum (May 26, 1962 from H. T. Hadenberg); and two FBI Reports.
Mr. Hartman stated the FBI Reports were reports of SA John Fain
dated August 30, 1962 and July 3, 1961. Mr. Wall stated the
FBI Reports were an Gctober 31, 1963 Report. of SA MiIton Kaack
and a May 12, 1960 Report of SA John Fain.

3. (a).. Cable traffic from JMWAVE Station to Headquarters fol-
lowing the President"s assassination reveals that JMWAVE's ‘file
contained information on Lee Harvey Oswald. For example, WAVE 8049
CIN 66782), November 22, 1963, states that AMSPELL files (Cuban

\W Student Directorate) of SMWAVE have background information on

HH Oswald. The Senate Select Committee requests access to Cuban
Student Directorate files of JMWAVE that contain information on
Oswald.

Mr. Walter: Elder
January 12, 1976
Page Two

- (b) The presence of information on Oswald in AMSPELL files
of JMYAVE suggests the possibility that JMWAVE files on other
Cuban exile groups might contain information on Oswald. The
Senate Select Commiticee would like .to determine if JMVAVE Station
was instructed by Headquarters to review its files for informa-
tion on Oswald and if JMJAVE files on Cuban groups contain. any
information about Oswald. The Senate Select Committee requests
access to JMWAVE files on Cuban groups that contain such informa-
tion. ”
