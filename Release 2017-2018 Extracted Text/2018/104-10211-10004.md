This act was the first in a chain of

events that is unequaled in complexity by any other Soviet

operation handled by the Central Intelligence Agency since

its establishment.

Because the case still has important

implications for

the overall Soviet intelligence effort

the United States, and because it raises nany basic questions

about the techniques of handling Soviet agents and defectors,

a reinvestigation of the case was commissioned by the Agency

in June 1976: The results are embodied in this report and

its annexes.

Although United States officials of many agencies, up

to and including

a president of the United States,

were briefed

on the case and either played some role in making decisions

concerning it or actively participated in running the

an unusual amount of research in the

actions taken

in regard to Nosenko were not the

result of decisions made by a unitary Agency acting as a

corporate entity; rather, in this case more than in most,

decisions were made by a

number of senior individuals on

basis of their own strongly-held views, which sometimes con-

flicted with the equally strongly-held

opinions of other

senior colleagues.

Thus, this report must,

all its complexity by referring when necessary to the

Organizational Background: CIA's Handling

the Central Intelligence Agency

fact,

opinions regarding the handling

of the Nosenko case may

differ substantially according to individual's differing

views regarding internal Agency organization and functioning.

This being the case, it is useful at the outset to make

explicit our understandirg of how the Agency actually func-

tioned in the relevant period, the 1960s,

as distinct fron

how it might theoretically have functioned

according to

Agency organizational charts and regulations.

The two instrumentalities for the conduct of day-to-day

operations in the Soviet field were the Soviet Bloc Division

(known successively by this and several other names*) and

the Counterintelligence Staff.

In the nature and interrela

tionship of these two organizations we find the key to much

of what was to happen in the Nosenko case.

"CI Staff" was actually a misnomer, because the organi-

zation carrying this name did not even concern itself to any

appreciable extent with the counterintelligence function of

the Agency on a worldwide basis.

Rather,

It concentrated on

changeably.

A third organizational participant in the Nosenko case

was the Office of Security.

This office had overlapping

jurisdiction with CI Staff

and, to a lesser extent,

SB Division

in any matter that involved a

penetration of the Agency.

overlapping jurisdiction was considerable in both chlem, the

Golitsyn and Nosenko cases because so much of the activity

in connection with both operations revolved around allegations

that the Soviets had penetrated the Agency at a high level.

Although allegations that the Soviets had recruited

Agency staff emplojees did not first originate with Golitsyn,

it was he who lent special force to them by spelling out a

complicated theory

of Soviet intentions and modus operandi.

He thus provided a detailed conceptual

framework within which

Once again, it is not necessary here to go into details

regarding Golitsyn, because this case has been covered exten-

sively in a recent studj. However, two points are worth

noting:

First, Golitsyn was diagnosed early in

1962 as a "paranoid personality.

was taken of this psychological

problem, it was

considered in the light of a threat to

is covered in more detail in Chapter VI of

this report.

It is against this background that we view the approach

to CIA by Nosenko and his subsequent handling.

In doing so,

we shall

for ease of reference from

time to time allude to

the thesis regarding KGB operations and intentions--claborated

by Golitsyn and others--as the "Monster Plot."

In fairness,

it must be allowed that this term was in common usage not

by the thesis' proponents but rather by its detractors; yet

no other name serves so aptly to capsulize what the theorizers

envisaged as a major threat to United States' security.

If

the term carries with it emotive connotations, the latter

were certainly shared by both sides to the controversy; and

this fact alone is enough to justify including "Monster Plot"

in the lexicon of this study.

offer of help in getting employment

In March 1953, while again in Moscow, Nosenko

Kobulov had just returned

from Germany to become the First Deputy Minister of the MVD

(Ministry of Internal Affairs).

Nosenko did not see Kobulov

personally but was referred by the latter's assistant to the

deputy chief of the Second Chief Directorate (internal coun-

terintelligence), hereafter referred to as SCD, by whom he

was hired.

His first MGB assignment was in the First (American

embassy) Section of the

Initial Contacts

When Nosenko first approached the CIA on 9 June

to be security officer of

being held in the Palais des Nations in Geneva.

Taking

advantage of the fact that he was the watchdog for the

delegation whereas its members could not watch him,

Nosenko used his treedom of movement to approach the

Agency, ostensibly for personal financial assistance.

Is he told it, Nosenko had recently slept with a

Wiss woman who had stolen 900 Swiss Francs of official

funds that he had on his person at the time; inability

to reimburse this relatively trivial amount

(about US.

$250 at the time) would jeopardize his career.

In ex-

change for 2,000

Swiss Francs, he therefore proposed

that he provide us with two items of information.

These items, subsequently verified, related

1.

KGB recruitment of a US Army sergeant

while he was serving in the American embassy

in Moscow as a "code machine repairman."

2. A Soviet official whom the Agency

had ostensibly recruited but who was being

Nevertheless, he "agreed

C.. The Case Against Nosenko

During the remainder of 1962 and 1963, SR Divisior

continued to build up a case against Nosenko.

sources, this fact not only confirned our suspicion

Nosenko

but was interpreted

as casting doubt on the

other sources as well.

While the above aspect will be covered at length

in Chapters V and VI, one example will serve to highlight

the attitude that prevailed.

Nosenko had, during our

neetings with him in 1962,

contributed information that

naterially aided in the identification

William John Christopher Vassall, a British Admiralty

official who was also a KGB agent.

Because Golitsyn

had previously provided similar, but less specific,

information,

the usefulness of Nosenko's intelligence

was discounted; once Vassall had been identified, it

was concluded that Nosenko had been allowed to expose

him in order to support his own bona fides.

The argu-

ment ran that Vassall would in any case have been identi-

fied sooner or later on the basis of Golitsyn's leads.

In January 1964, Nosenko reappeared in Geneva ac-

companying another Soviet delegation.

By now, the case

against him had been well established in the minds of

those dealing with the matter, and the record is there-

fore replete with manifestations of suspicion.

A particu-

lar example of our tendency

to intetpret unfavorably al-

most anything Nosenko said is provided by notes that

Chief, SR forwarded to Helms on 27 January 1964, with

the suggestion that they "convey very well the flavor

The above incident exemplifies a main theme that CIA

itself penetrated.

This fear had existed before

Golitsyn defected, but it was fed constantly by the lat-

ter's allegations

that information concerning him was

leaking to the KGB,

and the conclusion that the leaks

must have originated within the Agency.

Thus it was that a memorandum from Chief, SR on 27

January 1964, submitted to and approved by Helms, began

as follows:

Our goal in this case must be eventually to

break Subject and learn from him the details

of his mission and its relation to possible

penetrations

of US intelligence and security

agencies and those of allied nations as well

1

as early as possible but since this is

nlikely, our actions must be conceived and

arried out in a manner which contributes to

our basic goal without alerting Subject unduly

at any stage.

Far from "alerting Subject unduly," on the surface

the Agency welcomed Nosenko with both

cordiality and

generosity.

The following excerpts from a 30 January

1964 meeting make the point clearly:

As might be expected, the principal case officer

devoted a good deal of effort during the second Geneva

visit to persuading Nosenko to stay in place.

he became increasingly

anxious to defect immediately.

When the principal case officer continued to press him

to remain

in Geneva long enough to effect an audio pene

tration of the local rezidentura, Nosenko forced the

issue.

At a meeting on 4 February, he announced that a

cable had been received from Moscow ordering him back

home for a "tourism conference."

dinner with subject and the case officers.

Conversation during this first meeting was

general in nature and followed no special

agenda.

However, it did give me an oppor-

tunity to take Subject's measure.

I started

by telling Subject that I had come to form my

own impressions of him as a person and an

intelligence officer who desired to place his

The Agency's perception of the dilemma, and the possible

solutions to it, are covered in paragraphs 3, 4, 6 and

I of a memorandum written by Chief, SR and approved by

Helms on 17 February 1964:

While admitting that Subject is here on a KGB

February, the handler recorded his first impressions of

Nosenko:

putting him in three successive categories.

As the session ended and we moved into the

Before leaving the debriefing room I noticed

how he touched (another case officer) on the

I. Incarceration and Interrogation

Many aspects of this case did not go according to

plan, but one that did was the incarceration of Nosenko.

In Office of Security representative who periodicall

uarded Nosenko from November 1964 to May 1968, wher

questioned on 21 July 1976, described the regime as

Security Officer (SO):

Q: Nhat does visual custody observance mean? You

mean there's somebody in the room with him?

SO:

Of, the room had a special door. The top half

the door was a

type where we

were actually positioned outside the door on a

24-hour basis.

There were two security escorts

on duty 24 hours a day, and we were instructed

to maintain visual observance of him--just ob-

serve his activities.

2: Now, what was the purpose of visually observin

him

24 hours a day

SO: Apparently to see that he made no attempts to

escape, made no attempts to injure himself.

There were never any problems along these lines.

For much of his confinement, the principal break

in a day's monotony occurred when Nosenko was under

interrogation.

It is not necessary here to cover the

various interrogations in detail; suffice it to say that,

although they were conducted fitfully, with bursts of

activity followed by long periods of

quiescence, almost

graphs.

Meanwhile, Golitsyn had been brought into the case

and was being employed as a behind-the-scenes consultant

in connection

with the interrogations.

Golitsyn was

given for analysis voluminous material relating to the

case and was

told that "one of the most perplexing aspects

of the Nosenko case to us at the present time

is not

view that he was sent on a mission) but the exact nature

of his service with the KGB."

Golitsyn's role will

be covered more thoroughly in a separate chapter.

To ensure cooperation in the interrogation,

"Outline of Action to be Taken Should Subject Refuse

to Answer Requirements" was drawn up on 25 August 1964.

The tenor of this outline, which essentially set the

conveyed by the following excerpt "ntal late 1967, is

From the

makeshift physical set up of his i resert

quarters,

it is obvious to Subject

that his quarters (and therefore his situation)

is temporary.

As long as he knows that, he can

hope.

Our only hope of breaking Subject will

be to allow him to convince himself that he has

got into a situation fron which he can extricate

himself only by cooperating.

This could be

best achieved by breaking sharply with the

present situation, placing him in permanent

quarters, preferably renote and more primitive

than his

present quarters, physically secure

and resembling jail, and capable of being manned

by a minimum of guard personnel who would not

keep him under constant direct visual observa-

tion.

No Headquarters case officer would visit

him, until he has given sign that he has changed

his mind.

This period would last for several

months, pending another attempt to break him

based

on information obtained in the interin.

J. Elaboration of the Ploi Theory

The stringency of the rules governing treatment of

Nosenko varled from tine to time,

but the general trend

was to take

an ever harder line towards him.

Since it

was assumed that he was

a KGB-dispatched agent, he could

only

satisfy his interrogators by admitting that such

was the case.

But, while he would from time to time at-

lied or incorrectly reported

never at to che key orcus to sing ca-cont inch.

The inevitable result was not only greater harshness

toward him but a gradually spreading suspicion

in regard

to other agents, past and present, who seemed in any way

to support his bona fides.

This development is mirrored

in a memorandum that the principal case officer wrote

after a visit with Helms on 19 Yovember 1964:

In connection with Nosenko, Mr. Helms referred

to it as one of the greatest time consurers

he had ever seen.

other hand, no one had at his fingertips the vast array

of facts

and suppositions masquerading as facts, on

which the case was based.

The theory was therefore

difficult to challenge; there may even have been reluctance

to do so, because the main proponents of the disinformation

theory frequently referred to unhappy consequences that

would flow from abandoning the course upon which the

Agency had embarked.

Should the Agency change course,

on the same evening, immediately prior to his

removal to new quarters.

The purpose of this

session was not

to deliver a new message of

any sort,

or to give Subject "another

chance

to confess"; everything that could be said had

already been said by

rogators,

and there was

the previous

inter-

no doubt

that Subject

inderstood pertectly well the meaning anc

importance of what had been said to hin: also.

it was recognized that Subject would sense an

impending move or change of

some

SOTt,

and

that

it was inevitable that he would hope

that the

change would be for the better until he saw

otherwise.

The purpose of the confrontation

was rather to close the circle:

to show him

that although (the principal case officer) had

not seen him for over a year nothing had changed,

and nothing would change until he told the

truth.

An additional effect would be to empha-

size that the interrogators who had worked with

him in

the interin

were fully responsible and

authoritative, and

that just as Subject had been

told when he was first locked up in April 1964g

what he was up

against was the collapse of the

operation in which he was involved.

Finally,

[the principal case officer] would

stress...

that the "investigation is closed" and that

Subject had only prolonged and total isolation

to look forward

to now unless and until he

decides to confess.

The meeting took place just about as planned.

It lasted for 15 minutes

only (2100 to 2115)

and was essentially a formality, although it

is hoped

that Subject will have reason to re-

flect on it in the months ahead.

As can be

seen from

the attached

sumnary transcript,

Subject did not display any hesitancy of

indecision, and his answers and statements

were made in a mechanical manner.

Yet this period cannot be ignored. It constituted

over half of Nosenko's solitary confinement.

And that

three-and-a-half-year period amounts to five percent of

the total life span of a man who lives to be 70.

Obviously, then, this period will weigh heavily

in the findings made

at the conclusion of our study.

For these findings to be valid, they must be made on

the basis of as much empirical

evidence as can be

and

behavior during

[a

second

doctor's] inter-

view--on one hand

there were indications of

deterioration; on the other Nosenko is an

astute actor, who was clearly playing a role

for [that doctor].

Bearing in mind that these

superficial indications may well be a part of

this act, Nosenko appeared

far more subdued,

almost despondent, compared with six months

ago.

For most of the interview, he slouched

or sat listlessly in his chair and only sel-

dom did he lean

forward and, by the motions

of his hands, attempt to reach and to secure

the understanding and belief of the interviewer.

There appears to

be a slight deterioration in

his English-language fluency (see transcript

were broken by frequent

pauses, incomplete sentences, and confusing

revisions.

I should have honestly told you everything

admitted that although he had been documented "errone-

held a military rank higher than captain in the KGB.

It concluded:

(The reference to "special interrogation techniques"

harked back to a 13 January 1966 discussion with Helms,

during which the latter had stated that "he was inclined

to try special techniques on Subject in the hope that

they might somehow provide the answers we are seeking."

In this context, "special techniques" was a euphemism for

the use of drugs as aids in interrogation.

As will be

shown later,

although Helms was willing

to discuss the

use of such

techniques in this case,

he in fact never gave

his consent and they were never employed.

Nevertheless,

the use of drugs for interrogation purposes seems to have

been contemplated for some time,

since it is foreseen in

handwritten notes made by the principal case officer as

early as November 1964, and Chief, SR and the principal

case officer continued

to press for permission to employ

them until a final negative decision by Helms on 1

September 1966.)

in order to allow time for discussion with chief, i and

the psychiatrist.

Their combined judgment seems to have

been that the letters were "an attempt to relieve the

isolation by reestablishing personal contact, if only

with his interrogators."

He bolstered this

view by an

appeal to medical authority:

Helms remarked that Nosenko was "one person

are things

in this

case that

Noneiheless

in summing up

the sessions, the psychologist had this to say:

1 am totally at a loss to even

attempt to

rationalize why

this much

pathology would be used as a legend.

Nothing

could be served other than

to discredit the

man to whom it was assigned.

In some remote

sense--to me--it might have been felt it would

evoke sympathy but this is really far out and

a very

dangerous gamble on their part.

The

manner in which he

has told his story and

the nuances he has introduced would require

great ingenuity and preparation.

From my

standpoint, he has been essentially convincing

and accurate in general if not always truthful

in detail.

Here I am talking about the psycho-

logical data only--I am not prepared to ex-

press an opinion on other aspects.

Within

Whaterer

frame of reference i can operate,

an forced to conclude that all the psycholog

ical evidence would indicate that he is Nosenko,

the son of Ivan Nosenko.

His life story is

essentially as he has described it.

It is

obviously distorted in places but in each case

there

is a probable psychological reason for

the distortion and deception.

No man is a

good reporter on himself and we all use

rationalization to avoid seeing ourselves as

others see us.

My opinion, for whatever it

is worth, is that Nosenko cannot be broken

outside

the context of his life story and

personality structure.

It should be noted

here that the life story is completely com-

patible with the personality structure as

projected by psychological rests.

The psychologist claims now that he had more doubts

about the

validity of the SR view of Nosenko than he

felt it wise to express.

The following excerpt from a

menorandum

of conversation, dated 4 August 1976, gives

his memory of the situation facing him:

The conflicting vicws of the various interested

parties are not sufficiently

relevant to the purposes of

this study to require a detailed coverage.

What is

relevant is the fact that the stand-off increased Helms'

impatience with continued delay.

He therefore initiated

a number of measures that gradually took handling of the

entire Nosenko matter out of the hands of the SB Division.

The first

of these measures was to instruct the DDCI to

undertake a thorough study of the Nosenko case.

Wher debriefed regarding the Nosenko case

on 21

September 1976, the former DDCI remembered his

involvement

one way or the other.

Q: He said that it was wrong to keep him confined?

DDCI:

Yes, he was really distressed about the fact that

this fellow had been in confinement so long and

that they had never been able to arrive at a con-

clusion as to whether he was a bona fide or whether

he was a plant,

this chronicle to a close:

residence and since June 1969, his own automobile.

he chose to do so, acted

adverse to the best

interests of this Agency

such a nature as to

preclude independent action by Nosenko.

interested in maintaining the anonymity of his

current identity, that is, not becoming publicly

known as identical to Nosenko.

occasions indicated his interest in participating

CHAPTER IV

Nosenko's Contribution: A Summary Evaluation

Any attempt to assess Nosenko's value to the US govern-

ment must begin by pointing out that he might well have been

able to contribute more had he been permitted to do so.

• Unfortunately, ve here unwilling to

give serious considera-

to his stated desire to assist us in making recruitments

of Soviet officials; we

discounted Nosenko's suggestions

along this line as possibly part of a plan to embarrass the

US government. There is no telling what potential recruit-

ment targets might have emerged had we, soon after Nosenko's

defection, briefed him with such targets in view.

In this part of our study, we therefore confine our-

selves to a summary of the contributions that, despite con-

siderable odds, Nosenko was able to make. Let us take them,

very briefly, oe by one.

A. Information on KGB Personnel

The Office of Security"s 1968 report sumned up

Nosenko's contribution in this field as follows:

Nosenko has furnished information concerning

perhaps 2,000 KGB officers and 300 KGB agents

or operative contacts (here the terms agents

or operative

contacts are used to refer

to

Soviet nationals), mainly in the Second Chief

Directorate or internal KGB organizations.

However, he has identified approximately

• 250

former or current First Chief

Directorate

officers

and there is a considerable exchange

of officers between the FCD and SCD.

In

addition, numerous officers of the SCD and

other internal KGB organizations travel abroad

with delegations, tourist groups, and as

visitors

to various major exhibitions such

as World's Fairs.

It is inpossible at this

time to estimate

the number of KGB officers

identified by Nosenko who have been outside

the Soviet Bloc since his defection or who

will be out some time in the future.

B. KGB Recruitment Efforts Against US Citizens

Most of Nosenko's own operational experience with

the KGB involved efforts against US citizens, either

visitors to the USSR or members of the US embassy in

a result of this

ble to provide some 238 identifications of, or leads

to, Americans in whom the KGB had displayed

some interest.

Some of the KGB operational efforts culminated in

"recruitments" that, according to Nosenko, were more

statistical than real; the KGB played the numbers game,

for purposes of year-end reporting.

Nonetheless,

Nosenko's

reporting did

certain US citizens genuinely vorking for Soviet intel-

ligence:

Us Arny sergeant Robert k. Johnson,

who had been recruited in 1953, was arrested

in 1965 on the basis of a Nosenko lead

agent assigned to a US military installation

outside Paris who was providing

inportant documents as of 1962-1963. Johnson

was custodian of classified documents at Orly

Field Armed Forces Courier Transfer Station

luring this period, and he provided documents

from there.

Excerpts from a preliminary

damage assessment are included below:

The full extent of damage will only

be known when the current review of

documents by all affected agencies

is completed.

The damage assessments

prepared by the military services, how-

ever. based on a review of their docu

C. Moscow Microphones

In 1962, Golitsyn had in general terms reported on

the existence of microphones in the US embassy in Moscow.

This information was promptly sent to the Department of

State, but no action was taken; lack of specificity was

cited

as

one of

the reasons.

It was not until Nosenko's

more detailed information was communicated to

the Depart-

ment of State in March and June 1964 that action was

taken that led to th: uncovering of a system of 52 micro-

phones, beginning in Aprid of that year.

Of the micro-

found,

42 were active at the time of discovery.

These microphones covered most of the offices in the

embassy most significant from the Soviet standpoint.

Nosenko, in June 1962 Though this information

William John Christopher Vassall,

tended to give Golitsyn credit for this success.

The British counterintelligence service stated in

1976 that, although Vassall probably

would "eventually"

have emerged as a

"leading candidate" for suspicion as

a result of the Golitsyn information, it was in fact

Nosenko's information that

"was to clinch the identifica

tion of Vassall as the spy."

The British added that "(Nosenko's] information

affecting UK interests seems to have been consistent with

his position and we cannot recald any indication in the

leads of UK interest that [Nosenko's] object might have

been to mislead or deceive."

CHAPTER V

The Analytical Foundations of the "Monster Plot"

For the purposes of this study, we have not chosen

duplicate the mammoth effort put into analyzing and validating

Nosenko's information by the Office of Security in CIA and

by the FBl; we have reviewed their work and can find no pos-

sible reason to challenge their findings.

There remains,

howevet erroneous

the question

of how senior officials could have draw

so many

conclusions

data tendered by a source

whom we now believe to have been cooperative and acting in

good faith.

A. Lack of Systematic Interrogation

At no time between June 1962 and October 196% was

Vosenko afforded the kind of systematic, objective, non-

hostile interrogation by well-informed professional in

telligence officers which had otherwise been standard

operating procedures in dealing with defectors

We now examine the manifestations and consequences

of this problem at various stages of the case.

1. June 1962 Meetings

The transcripts of the 1962 meetings reveal a

disastrous problem of communication:

loud and dramatic to excited whispering.

the longest of the five,

was further disorganized by the fast chat Nosenko

arrived half-drunk from partying the previous day

and most of the night.

Even during the nearly eight-

hour interview, Nosenko continued to drink.

This

point was consistently overlooked or ignored in later

examination of boastful claims Nosenko made during

this meeting; e.g., Nosenko personally handled the

Langelle/ Popov

operation against a

case, usosentri

personally ran the

security officer, Nosenko

personally talked

to a US

code clerk to

cruit him,

try

to re

etc.

When confronted in hostile interroga-

tions in 1964 and 1965 with these claims, he denied

personal participation in all three instances (other

than directing the code clerk case behind the scene)

and said that if he had said such things in 1962 it

was because he was either drunk or under very strong

tension at the time.

Such explanations were not con-

sidered acceptable by his interrogators, and the

claims were let stand as evidence of his mendacity.

Nhile Nosenko provided a substantial amount

of information during these five meetings, there

was little or no follow-up questioning on most of it,

partly because of lack of time but also because of

the case officers' lack of background on the KGB in

general and the Second Chief Directorate in particular.

January-March 1964

The second series of meetings in Geneva, in

January and February 1964, were somewhat better

organized,

but-given the already prevailing bellef

that Nosenko was a KGB controlled agent--he was not

carefully questioned on the infornation he gave.

This was partly because it was considered of

prinary importance not to reveal even by implica-

tion how much we

already knew, lest his mission

include elicitation of information CIA had received

from Golitsyn or other sources considered bona fide.

Debriefings in the United States after Nosenko's

defection were

similarly limited to noncontroversial

generalities and were not noteworthy for attention to

accuracy and detail./

3. April 1964-October 1966

The hostile confrontation that took place for

some two weeks in April 1964 cannot be considered

systematic interrogation; "shouting matches" would

better characterize these sessions.

During one period--May to November 1964--Nosenko

was systematically debriefed in neutral fashion to

obtain

additional information on leads to Americans

and other Westerners recruited by the KGB, in part to

meet requirements provided by the FBI.

The other

two objectives of this debriefing period, of greater

importance to the CIA concerns in this case, were:

--to obtain answers to questions posed in writing

by Golitsyn, whose aim was

to trap Nosenko into

exposing his ignorance or "lies" about topics

Golitsyn considered central to Nosenko's

missions."

SECRET

## Page 94

-89-

-- to acquire fuller background on Nosenko's

alleged duties and activities in his various

KGB positions in order to use his own informa-

tion against him in the hostile interrogation

period

that was to follow.

The January-March 1965 hostile interrogations

were carefully structured and systematic but were

not designed to collect information.

The information

Nosenko provided in these sessions was consistently

and intentionally ignored, as the stated objectives

here to force

Nosenko to agree with his interrogators

that (1) he did not know what he should have known

(according to CIA assumptions), and (2) that he had

not held the positions in the KGB that he claimed.

This objective was

"successfully" achieved in the

eyes of the

interrogators by bringing Nosenko to

sign statements

that purported to summarize his

statements of inadequacy of both knowledge and

he acknowledged his inability to get his interroga-

to

therefore his

satisfactory to him.

When given one key

"protocol"

to sign--one that was a "confession"

that he nad been

sent by the KGB to deceive CIA,

and that he had lied purposely on behalf of the

KGB-he said that, if his signing this document

would serve some

good purpose of CIA or of the US

government in general, he would do so, but only with

his interrogators'

clear understanding that the

entire "confession" was untrue.

Under these circum-

stances, his interrogators declined to have him sign

this document.

Thus this series of interrogations

failed in its ultimate objective--that of "breaking"

Nosenko.

Subsequent interrogation sessions were not con-

structed

to collect information any more

than the

previous ones but were designed to collect further

damaging evidence of Nosenko's ignorance about the

KGB and of the areas in his reporting to which he

was "most sensitive" and that therefore were most

revealing of his "true KGB missions."

In

to Nosenko and a large amount of paper was

generated in consequence,

the canons of proper

interrogation were rarely observed.

4. Time Devoted to Debriefing or Interrogation

A point that can easily be overlooked is that,

of the total period of Nosenko's incarceration, a

relatively modest amount of time was devoted to

actually debriefing or interrogating hin. The most

generous estimate we can make is that approximately

292 days were at least in part devoted to debriefing

or interrogating Nosenko, out of a total of 1,277

days' incarceration.

from the

standpoint of

obtaining information,

about 77 percent, or more

than three-quarters, of the detention period was

downtime.

B. Faulty Record of Conversations with Nosenko

The outcome of the Nosenko case was prejudiced at

the outset by the establishment of a faulty record.

If anything, the role of the second case officer,

who had a native command of Russian but little patience

with detail. simply compounded the errors.

When hostile interrogations

began on 6 April 1964,

the inaccurate biography was used as the base point for

measuring so-called "lies" about Nosenko's entire life

It therefore caused him to be accused time and

again of "changing his stories."

One of the first wrangles that

arose in the hostile

interrogations concerned his responses

questions on

his schooling.

Among other aspects

of this subject,

Nosenko told his interrogators that he had spent approxi-

mately three years during World War II

in various naval

preparatory schools--(rough equivalent of American high

school-level military

"academies").

The problem that

arose

in this instance was

traceable first to a careless

transcription by

the second case officer but was exacerbated

by ignorance on the part of the interrogators concerning

the subject under discussion. Because it typifies other

misapprehensions that complicate the josenko case, this

example is worth relating in detail.

The second case officer "transcribed" the tape of

the 25 January

that Nosenko was lying because Artamonov's memories of

the schools differed from Nosenko's:

Adding to the mystery of Nosenko's war-

time years is

the information provided by

Nikolay Artamonov, the Soviet naval defector.

When Nosenko's defection was first made public.

Artamonov volunteered the information that, if

this was the same Nosenko who was the son

of a

minister, he had attended school with him

in

Leningrad.

Later, when shown photographs of

Nosenko he positively identified him as the

same

man he had known in Leningrad in the

period 1944 to 1946 and gratuitously provided

the names of six schoolmates from Leningrad

that Nosenko should remember because they were

prominent members of the student body there.

Nosenko was subsequently queried about three

of these names, but out of context and with

no indication

of who and what they might be.

He immediately identified them as schoolmates,

but positively affirmed that two

of them had

been the roommates

in Kuybyshev in 1941-1942,

while the other had been

in the school in Baku.

According to Nosenko, none had gone on to

Leningrad.

Of the names provided by Artamonov,

Nosenko mentioned a fourth one independently,

but although he originally placed him in

Leningrad he later moved him to Kuybysher and

stated

categorically that he saw him for the

last time in Moscow in 1942, before going to

Leningrad.

Artamonov, whose own elementary

and secondary schooling is a curious parallel

to Nosenko's, has provided other information on

the schools and dates which Nosenko claims to

have attended which is incompatible with Nosenko's

story but it has not been believed advisable to

requery Artamonov on this until we can be

certain that Artamonov is not deliberately

trying to substantiate Nosenko's bona fides

according to a prearranged plan which misfired

owing to crossed signals or Nosenko's poor

memory.

1.

Nosenko had been misquoted in the

second

case officer's transcript, because

the second case officer did not understand

what he was talking about.

He had referred

specifically to the "Leningrad Naval

Preparatory School named after Frunze," a

fact once again uncovered by the 1954 defector's

rechecking of the meeting tape,

but not until

May 1965.

When Nosenko

"admitted" to his

interrogators in April 1964 that he had not

attended the Academy, he didn't know this was

considered an admission; he never realized

his interrogators had thought he had made such

a claim.

2.

In general, rosenko's interrogators

overestimated their

substantive background.

Nosenko's "stories" about the several naval

preparatory schools he had attended during the

war are difficult to follow, because war

conditions brought about a number of reloca-

tions of these schools:

the Leningrad School

was relocated

to Omsk

oblast but was still

called Leningrad School; the Moscow School was

relocated first to Achinsk, then to Kuybyshev,

but was still the Moscow School, etc.

Nosenko's

interrogators were almost totally ignorant of

these matters but did not know they were.

Because they were unable to follow his detailed

description

of

all these changes

(documented

by other informed sources, including Soviet

historians), they thought something was wrong

with Nosenko, not with themselves.

that Abidian

Both these problems seems minor in and of themselves.

But they were not minor in the context of the inquisition

to which Nosenko was subjected.

Rather, the discrepancies

involved were evoked, as was every other discrepancy

arising from whatever cause, to bolster the case against

him.

above, he denied that he had any such fixed administra-

He contended that the other

officers in the section were not children and did not

require that Nosenko teach them what to do and how to

do it.

The outline of

the duties of a "deputy chief" was

erroneous, because it was based on a misinterpretation

of the Russian word

zanestitel, the term Nosenko applied

to himself when speaking his native language.

When the

meaning of this terms was researched in 1968, a clear

distinction was drawn

between the American and Soviet

conceptions of a "deputy":

"Zamestitel," or "Deputy," in Soviet bureau-

cratic practice and usage

in

the office,

but rather is a broader term

which can

most

accurately

be

rendered in English as "assistant."

Soviet

offices, at least at the higher

levels,

commonly have several "Deputies"; some may

have five or six or even more.

with this multiplicity, the Soviet term does

not carry with it the same sense of responsi

bility and authority paralleling the Chiet

and of automatic replacement as the American

term.

The Soviet position of "Deputy" is

probably not as intimately associated with a

specific slot as is the American position

of Deputy, if indeed it is so associated at

• all.

In addition, the outline of a "deputy chief's"

duties can be considered

tendentious because It was de

1. Prologue

It is ironic that both Nosenko and Golitsyn

should have become so involved in

the retrospective

analysis of the Popov case, because neither knew a

great deal about it.

Perhaps they would not have

ecome thus involved had it not been for the dis

information hypothesis.

Some time after 19 June 1962 the principal case

officer was

given access to tape transcripts of de-

briefings of Anatoliy Golitsyn, the KGB officer who

had defected in Helsinki in December 1961.

In a memorandum written by the principal case

officer dated 27 June 196?, the day after his inter-

view with Golitsyn, he set forth his views on

"Possible Control of (Nosenko)." He opened with a

statement:

"Detailed study of (Golitsyn's] produc-

tion in the light of (Nosenko's] has suggested the

possibility that Nosenkol may be part

to October 1959, when the KGI

rolled up the operation in Moscow.

He was the most

important Soviet source CIA had ever had until the

advent of Penkovskiy in 1961.

Therefore, any informa-

tion Nosenko might have on how the KGB had learned

of Popov's clandestine cooperation with CIA was of

great interest.

In Nosenko"s discussion of Popov's compromise,

he explained that, in January 1959, the KGB had had

the letter, found that it was addressed to Petr

Popov, and

came to realize that this Soviet was

working for CIA.

He was arrested soon there-

after and sent under KGB direction to make

several clandestine meetings with another CIA

officer, Russell Langelle.

Finally in October

1959 the KGB apprehended Langelle immediately

after such a meeting, with material in his

possession just received from Popov. The Popov

case was over.

Under Golitsyn's influence,

ais doubts concerning Nosenko's bona fides led

the use of an analytical technique that he described

as trying "to read the case through a mirror to

find

its implications if it is bad.

By the time

this June 1962 memorandum was

written, the principal

case officer had decided that the story of the Popov

compromise given by Nosenko was the primary area to

determine whether CIA itself had been penetrated by

the KGB.

Golitsyn's 1962 reporting on how Popov

was compromised, i.e.,

identified by name

through KGB

surveillance of Langelle in Moscow

in 19J9, varied from Nosenko's story only in the

name of

the officer surveilled.

The Golitsyn

report was actually completely omitted from a

17 April 1963 memorandum.

(Why this omission

passed unnoticed is not explained in any records

Yet when Golitsyn gave a com-

pletely different story of the compronise in June

this

story became the Golitsyn gospel

and has remained so to this day in Golitsyn's

argumentation.

We shall come to Golitsyn's 1964

version

shortly, but first some additional back-

ground is needed.

Since Nosenko had said that Popov was com-

promised through KGB surveillance of Winters, the

"mirror" technique indicated that this was not

the case.

The mental leap from this postulate

was that if surveillance of Winters was not the

cause of the

compromise,

recruitment of Winters

Penkovskiy's arrest heightened the suspicions

within CIA--especially Soviet Russian Division--

that there

must be a KGB penetration of CIA for

two such calamities to have occurred within three

Penkovskiy (like Popov) had been exposed to the

&GB through its omnipresent surveillance in Moscow,

senior SR Division officers interpreted this report

as proof of KGB disinformation designed to conceal

KGB penetration of CIA.

4. Golitsyn's 1964 Story

In June 1964, while commenting on Nosenko®s

version of the Popov compromise,

Golitsyn stated

that the KGB report he had referred to in 1962

stated that the KGB did not consider running Popov

as a double because he could not be trusted.

He

then went on to give a completely new story of the

•

Popov compromise, diametrically opposite to his

original information.

Golitsyn stated then that a certain Kotov

agent and made

Dezinformatsiya: Origins of the Concept and

Application in the Nosenko Case

There can be litfle doubt that the handling Nosenko

Furthermore,

the timing of Nosenko's defection,

some months after that of

Golitsyn,

the fact that Josenko provided information on some

of the same or similar persons or leads as had Golitsyn, and

Golitsyn's conclusion

that Nosenko had been dispatched by the

IGB specifically to discredit him (Golitsyn) as part of :

lezintormatsiya operationall these factors combined t

preclude "normal" professional treatment of Nosenko.

As a

defector, Nosenko's bona fides should have been established,

or not established,

on ine basis of careful and sound

analysis

and investigation of the information he provided

under standard interrogation procedures.

In actuality, he

came under suspicion as a KGB-controlled agent long before

he presented himself as a defector, and his handling was

therefore based upon

this prejudgment.

Dezinformatsiya is a Soviet concept and practice of

standing

that has been defined or described y numerous

sources through the years. Two representative definitions

are as follows:

Petr Deryabin: Dezinformatsiya is the

deliberate and purposeful dissemination of false

infornation regarding accomplished facts and/or

intentions, plans of action, etc., for the pur-

pose of misleading the enemy.

Such disseminations

may be accomplished by means of the press, radio

operations itself.

term dezintormatsiya is used to denote false, in-

complete,

confirmed to opposition services for the purpose

of causing these

By means of dezinformatsiya, again according to

Golitsyn,

the Soviet government hopes

to

ensure that the

policy decisions of a gien country will be based on a false

impression of the USSR's domestic or military posture.

Specific measures taken to achieve this end might be designed

to induce a foreign country to engage in costly and useless

research projects, to create a misconception about or adversely

affect the stature of another country in the eyes of the world,

within that unit, and not until 1961

that the concept of

The dezinformatsiya concept was first highlighted for

situation,

after review of the probable areas of informa-

He indicated

in this connection that the Disinformation Department of the

KGB maintained extensive files organized on a topical basis,

containing all information on a given topic that was known

(from the debriefing of defectors to the Soviets, double

agents, captured agents, etc.) to be in the hands of opposi-

tion intelligence services.

For example, a KGB officer

assigned to Beirut to work

against the American embassy who

defected to ClA would be assumed by the KGB Department of

Disinformation to have told CIA e erything he l

about

KGB operations against the embassy and embassy personnel.

By reference to their files on Beirut operations, the Depart-

ment of Disinformation would be able to determine the extent

to which KGB operations in that area had been compromised to

CIA.

On the basis of the foregoing information, it might be

assumed that the Golitsyn and Nosenko defections would have

received similar handling by the KGB Department of Disinforma-

tion and by CIA upon their arrival as defectors to the West.

However, the two men were not similarly received by CIA when

they presented themselves as defectors;

they received com-

pletely different handling,

based

on quite different assess-

ment of the information they provided and their motives for

defecting.

Information that he provided relating to the organization

because the information appeared to be logical

In addition, he provided voluminous and valuable information

That Nosenko did

not receive standard treatment as a defector whose bona fides

would be determined on the basis of the information he pro-

vided under interrogation after defection inevitably involves

reference to Golitsyn.

As explained in Chapter 1il,

Golitsyn

himself played a curious role in that, as

a result of the

trust placed.in his judgment, he was

actually encouraged to

label Nosenko as a deception agent.

This situation arose as follows:

During initial contacts

with

CIA in 1962, Nosenko provided information on personalities

that was similar

the "duplication" or "overlapping" information given by Nosenkc

was viewed with extreme suspicion.

This original doubt led

to information provided by Nosenko being shown to Golitsyn

soon after the former's

defection.

The paranoid Golitsyn

immediately saw Nosenko as a person sent out to discredit or

even assassinate him.

Thereafter, the desire of CIA counterintelligence offi-

cers not to be outwitted by the KGB led them to apply an ana-

lytical technique that has been referred to variously as "double

think" or "mirror reading."

This "analysis" led to the con-

to discredit Nosenko in order to maintain a position of pre-

services) on Soviet intelligence matters, and (b) to promote

his contentions as to how the West was being deceived by the

Soviet Union

in political and strategic matters, and thus

to enhance his position

as advisor to governments on overall

Soviet political matters.

Golitsyn clearly had a high opinion of himself. When

he defected, he brought with him some

23 classified docu-

ments from

the Soviet embassy in Helsinki, which he made

clear he wished to discuss with President

Kennedy and the

Director of Central Intelligence personally, to

alert them

to what was going on and to measures needing to be taken.

Moreover, his willingness to cooperate with CIA and other

US government agencies underwent changes fron time to time,

depending upon whether his demands for access to and inter-

views with specified ranking officials of those organizations

were granted.

Golitsyn's chosen role as ipterpreter of Soviet policy

and anti-western actions was threatened by the arrival of

Nosenko.

His response was to gain access to virtually all

of CIA's files on Nosenko for purposes of providing ClA with

The fact that many of these cases were primarily of historic

interest, undertaken at a particular time to take advantage

of or exploit a particular situation that

no longer obtained

or had little or no pertinence to Nosenko's defection, appears

to have been discounted. On the contrary, since the cases

included in the study were considered to have been hugely

successful in duping or deluding the Western intelligence

services and governments, it was concluded that we were con-

tinuing to be

deluded and duped.

It was reasoned that, as

CIA and other western intelligence services becane increas-

niques being used against them and changed their operational

tactics accordingly,

the KGB simply adjusted to the new

situation and continued to outwit us.

In retrospect, it seems worthwhile to point out that

(a) in the years since Nosenko's first contact and subsequent

defection, no information has ever been developed to sub-

stantiate

the charges made against him either by Golitsyn

or by the "mirror-readers"; (b) Golitsyn's information with

In Nosenko's case,

then, the entire effort was to force

him to admit to CIA's accusations rather than to obtain in-

formation from him in any logical or systematic fashion.

Efforts were made to "trap" him or "throw him off balance,"

by indicating that CIA had "proof" that he was lying, that

his only option was to "confess" that he had been sent by

the KGB, etc.

His denials of charges or

refusals to "con-

fess" only resulted in increasingly hostile treatment. While

his statements did contain inconsistencies, and there were

questions for which he gave no adequate or

consistent and

logical answers,

the manner in which he was questioned was

Golitsyn controlled his own interrogation,

on occasion refusing even to talk to CIA officers.

A. The Role of the Psychologist

The psychologist's role will be dealt with first

because,

to judge by the written record, he was the

first to assess Nosenko from the psychological point

of view, by means of a brief interview and

test administered

on 23 June 1964.

His initial report is dated 9 July 1964.

In addition, he interviewed Nosenko at length in 14 ses-

sions during the period 3-21 May 1965.

He then wrote a

chronicle of Nosenko's life and

an

overall psychological

evaluation based on these interviews.

By way of background, it should be said that the

Subsequent events have revealed that Nosenko's

falsehoods were in fact minor ones.

But the psychologist

1id not know all this; told that Nosenko lied constantly

and knowing that manipulative lying is part of the

psychopathic syndrome, he diagnosed Nosenko as a psycho-

path.

The term "psychopath" (another term used inter-

changeably is "sociopath") itself deserved a word of

xplanation, because its connotation is misleading.

sike so many psychological terns, it evolved out of the

fact that psychologists tend to be involved primarily

with people in trouble, very often with those who end up

in prisons and mental institutions.

A survey of psycho-

logical Literature reveals, not surprisingly, that the

one quintessential criterion of a psychopath is that he

is habitually given to criminal

or delinquent behavior.

The critéria that psychologists

use in distinguishing

between psychopaths and non-psychopaths have been

developed almost entirely from studies of juvenile

delinquents, criminals and mental patients, and thus the

term is really only applicable with any certainty to in-

dividuals belonging to one or another of those groups.

Despite this fact,

testing of many people who are not

delinquent or criminal may yield a score or profile

of scores suggesting psychopathy.

To illustrate the

point, let us take an example.

On the Minnesota

Multiphasic Personality Inventory (one of the most widely

used clinical testing instruments in this country), the

profile that suggests psychopathy has also been generated

in testing persons who turned out to be good WACs in

World War II and others who have been predicted as

likely to succeed in the life insurance business. Yet,

good WACs and life insurance agents are obviously not

groups to whom we would ordinarily apply the term

"psychopath." Thus, the fact that you have a predis-

position to psychopathy does not mean that you necessarily

become one: the psychopathic profile on either the MMPI

or the PAS

test is merely a warning signal of what you

might do under certain adverse circumstances.

When he tested Nosenko, the psychologist was not

fully aware of all the pressures under which this defector

was functioning.

He was unaware of the manner of his

sudden confinement after glowing promises had been made

of rewards for defection; of the falsified polygraph

results, and the fact that Nosenko had been informed

SECRET

145-

that the examination showed him guilty of deception;

or of the fact that the principal case officer had

told Nosenko that the latter's information (later to

prove of great value) was all "crap."

Given these

factors, we would have to conclude a priori that the

resultant PAS personality profile was likely to be

partly spurious.

The exact extent to which the psychologist's test

results were inexact cannot be determined, but one

example is illustrative of the possibilities.

One part

of the profile suggested that Nosenko was endowed with

a well-below average memory.

That his memory was

functioning at less than

average level at the time he

took the test cannot be doubted; but it has already

been made clear that he was functioning under extrenely

adverse conditions, and, since the Wechsler subtest that

measures

memory span has been experimentally shown to be

vulnerable to

so-called state (1.e.g

temporary) anxiety,*

this

aspect of the personality profile must be considered

spurious.

From Nosenko's performance during extensive

debriefings since he was released from confinement and

began to receive normally humane treatment, we know that

his memory is in fact exceptionally good.

We can ont

conclude that, if it functioned badly at the time of test-

ing, this was

largely owing to anxiety induced by treat-

ment received at the hands of CIA.

As to the psychologist's characterization of

Nosenko as a psychopath,

the linitations of such a

diagnosis have already been made clear.

The psychologist's evaluation contained a section

entitled "Vulnerabilities" that was, once again, clearly

based on the premise that Nosenko was dissembling, when

he denied being under continued KGB control. The psychologist

Under prolonged pressure he will admit almost

anything to get relief.

Another vulnerability

is that he will "break" in order to get relief.

Care should be taken to continue pressure

for

some time after an initial break

is secured

to allow for vacillation and nodification.

Long periods of isolation after these breaks

may be useful in evaluating the reliability

of his

information.

In general, it is better

to give him slight rewards (e.g, cigarettes,

baths, etc.) for no apparent eason than to

tie them to periods of cooperation, etc.

The psychologist's last major involvement in the

case

appears to have been the series of debriefings having

to do with Nosenko's personal history, conducted during

the period 3-21 May 1965.

These led the psychologist to

the following conclusions and rocommendations:

Nosenko's story was

consistent with

the previous diagnosis of a "bright sociopath"

(i.e., psychopath).

The above findings were still insufficient for some

of very specific questions to be put to the psychologist.

Of these the first three will be quoted, together with

the psychologist's answers:

This man's story is full of demon-

strable lies.

Often these lies seem point-

they are studied.

When challenged, he will

sometimes retreat from

one of his

stories;

in other

instances, he will cling

adamantly

to one even when it is clear to all that he

is lying and even when he has an easy way

and rationalizations

are harder to under-

As a psychologist

who had dealt

previously with

a number of

Soviet defectors, he had a

great degree of insight.

On the other hand, he knew

that he did not have all the facts, beccuse Chief, SR

had specifically told him so.

Insight is of very little

use when not based on adequate data.

Helms tried to help. When told by the psychologist

that the latter did not have all the facts necessaR

make a judgment about Nosenko, Helms called Chief,

and instructed him that the psychologist should be fully

informed.

This instruction appears to have been disre-

garded.

We can only conclude that the psychologist did what

could legitimately be expected of him, within the con-

straints of the Agency's command structure. " The weak-

nesses that in retrospect we can perceive in the

psychologist's diagnosis

and recommendations can be as

cribed

directly to

his being asked

to make professional

judgments based on inadequate knowledge.

The propriety

of the Agency's employing a professional in this manner

should be carefully reviewed.

B. The Role of the Psychiatrist

The psychiatrist's role in the Nosenko operation

was more extensive and of longer duration than the

psychologist's.

In addition to physical examinations,

it included giving advice on how Nosenko should be treated

while in confinement, advice

on special interrogation

techniques such as the use of sodium pentothal, and an

assessment of Nosenko's personality.

The psychiatrist has stated (in discussions

with the senior author of this report chat he had

been told when he was first assigned

to the case that

Nosenko was concealing information of great importance

to the US government.

That he worked throughout thi

case under this assumption is evident from the total

context of his reporting.

On the other hand, there

is no evidence that either SR Division or CI

staff

shared the reasons for their suspicions with him to a

sufficient extent for him to have evaluated their

claim, even had he been qualified by professional

background to make such an evaluation.

He knew and

accepted his limitations in the latter regard; for

example,

ih a report dated 23 February 1965,

after

he had

spent an hour observing an interrogation, he

remarked:

[Nosenko] comes off (in] his responses to

questions (at least when I saw him) in the

same fashion as always though I am not

says.

atrist's name was invoked frequently in operational

correspondence,

generally without his knowledge; for

example,

in a 27 November 1964 memorandum to the DDP,

concerning arrangements for forthcoming interrogations,

Chief, SR stated:

By implication, this and other similar references evoked

The psychiatrist's diagnosis of Nosenko, which

he labeled "Psychiatric Impressions," was dated 20

December 1964.

It read in part:

Psychiatric impression is that of an individual

who shows an

above average intelligence capacity,

is shrewd and perceptive.

While he claims to

have desired to cooperate and work with US

officials, his antisocial behavior was destruc-

tive and self-defeating to the aims he claimed

to pursue.

His own needs and desires are of

paramount

importance to him and he manipulates

those

around him

without regard to consequence

in order to satisfy his needs.

As such he tends

to be selfish, ungrateful, narcissistic and

exhibitionistic.

there is no concern for the feelings or interests

of others.

We are thus justified in concluding that, in the

professional was not given the proper "collateral in-

formation" on the basis of which to render a sound profes-

sional judgment.

More explicitly, because neither the

psychiatrist

nor psychologist was accurately informed

even about such basic aspects of the case as the promises

made to Nosenko (which could not possibly be considered

to have had sensitive security implications, neither

man had an accurate criterion for judging the appropri-

ateness of Nosenko's behavior in seeking better treatment.

Given the apparent

consensus among the Agency's

leadership that there were good and sufficient reasons

for incarcerating and trying to "break" Nosenko, it is

not surprising in hindsight that the psychiatrist offered

judgments and advice extending well beyond the bounds of

conventional medicine and psychiatry.

Since his quasi-

operational participation in this case has been covered

to some degree in Chapter Ill, we need only reevoke a

few examples here:

His judgment of 24 February 1966 that "thing

ound to chance as

far as Nosenko is con-

cerned--he is either going to stop faking or

things will get worse."

--His judgment, reported on 26 April 1966,

that reestablishing contact between Nosenko

and the interrogators would be a serious mis

take because it would constitute a "relief."

program. They are only partially relevant to Nosenko's

situation, because no experimenter in the non-Communist

world has ever attempted to impose social isolation or

other forms of deprivation on experimental subjects for

more than a few days at a time.

The Soviets,

who are

sound by tewer restrictions than we, have employed

durations of up to 60 days.)

Nevertheless,

while vari-

ous researchers have obtained diverse results, there

is ample evidence that certain psychological, physiolog-

ical, and behavioral' impairments do indeed result from

severe restrictions being placed on physical activity,

sensory stimulation, and social interaction; and this

generalization seems to apply to

Soviets in much the

same way as it does to Americans. The psychiatrist's

judgments were not doubt based in good faith on his

clinical judgment,

but the question remains as to

whether the latter was not distorted by his apparent

commitmert to the cause of "breaking" Nosenko.

Thus we

are led inevitably to the problem of whether such a

commitment is appropriate in the case of a doctor of

medicine.

At the time CIA was established, the primary mission

of what was later to becone the Plans Directorate's

Clandestine Service was conceived to be the collection

of strategicilly-significant intelligence from clandestine

human sources.

How successful was the Clandestine Service

in fulfilling this mission?

Agency claims of success in the human-source col-

lection field have often

tionally or not, as to give the impression that our

those who led the Clandestine Service may shed light on

recommendations for future action.

rather

interest in long-range analysis.

Within the Clandestine

Service, his generation was in general suspicious of

theory and ill-prepared in most cases to cope with it.

On the other hand, the best of the Service's leaders

--and there

were many

good ones--were successful because

they possessed a difficult-to-define quality called com-

mon sense.

Its value should not be underestimated.

For

example

when Penkovskiy was producing strategic intelli-

gence that remains of

value to this day,

it was the com-

mon sense of these other

leaders that led them

to resist

Chief, CI's

allegation that Penkovskiy was a "disinforma-

tion

agent."

Nevertheless,

senior Clandestine Service supervisors

of the period 1948-1970 had seldom themselves been trained

in rigorous analytic techniques, and thus they s+ldom

were in a position

to demand high standards of analysis

of their subordinates.

Until the massive outflow of

retirees in recent years changed the demography of the

Service, most senior operational supervisors had received

their higher educations before systematized analysis be-

came routine even

in such

"soft"

subjects as political

science (for which

a knowledge of inferential

most, of these same gentlemen were also educated during

in academe; when the study of classical

logic had passed

from vogue but had not yet been replaced

is no evidence of any appreciable long-term

among the latter.

to be

subject to the vagaries of the momentary line-up of

CIA leadership.

The cxistence of an

Interagency

Defector Committee, subordinate to the DDP, introduced

some uniformity of

approach,

but its concerns were

limited for the most part to superficial administrative

and procedural formalities.

Summary

If we seem to have wandered far afield from the

nature and validity of methodology of previous Nosenko

bona fides studies, we have done so because the unfortunate

handling of Nosenko was not an isolated event. Rather,

it was symptomatic of some fundamental inadequacies of

the

Plans Directorate.

What this means

to us is that the

long-needed improvement in our conduct of counterintelli-

gence activity, now well underway, must be carried on

within the framework of a searching reexamination of the

analytical techniques employed by the Directorate and its

Clandestine Service.

Whatever the course taken, however, we believe that

the last quarter of this century is going to be

even more

exigent, though in a different way, than the past twenty-

five years.

We therefore sum up

the implications of this

chapter by posing a single question:

How can we ensure

that the upcoming generation of Clandestine Service leaders

is better prepared intellectually to meet the challenges

that face them than were those who ran the Service in

the sixties?

CHAPTER XII

Conclusions and Recommendations

A.

Nosenko case which will address the following

matters:

(1]. The bona fides of Nosenko.

ments.

The relationship and

significance of absenon to other

[5). The nature and validity of

methodology of previous Nosenko bona

fides studies.

and probably the framers of the above letter, anticipated.

Nonetheless, we shall commence this concluding chapter

with responses to the matters covered in sub-paragraphs

a. through e.

•1. Bona Fides

Doubts regarding Nosenko's bona fides were of

our own making.

properly, he could have been declared a bona fide

defector

as readily as have many other Soviet in-

telligence officers.

This is not to say that we can be certain of

the genuineness

any defector.

It will always

But the useful-

ness

of the

Soviets' doing so, in the manner as-

cribed to them

in the Nosenko

case, is probably as

slight. as

is the feasibility.

Soviet success in

using native-born citizens of other countries to

spy on their own homelands has been considerable.

there is no record of the USSR's suc-

cesfully infiltrating the sovernment of a major

non-Communist power by use of an acknowledged

Soviet citizen,

least of all one whose career has

been spent in a Soviet intelligence or security

service.

We therefore conclude that Nosenko was from

the beginning a bona fide defector.

2. Value of Nosenko

Nosenko's contribution has been summarized in

Chapter IV.

He has been of great value, but he

probably could have been even more valuable had he

seen properly handled.

3. Relationship to Other Agents and Operations

As was made clear in Chapters X and XI, the

Nosenko case, through no fault of the defector him-

self, had a most unfortunate effect on all clandestine

operations in the Soviet field.

Identification of Unexploited Leads

We have not felt that this subject was one we

could feasibly or properly investigate.

To do so

would have meant delving into the past and current

operations of both the SE Division and the CI Staff

to ascertain the extent to which there might have

persons

whom Nosenko identified by name.

not have permitted us to accomplish this

task, nor would our doing so have been consistent

with the principle of compartmentation.

5. Methodology

It has been made clear in Chapter XI that the

variety of techniques used in handling Nosenko did

not conform to any generally accepted sense of the

term "methodology."

B. Recommended Action

Most of our recommendations for action have been

previously stated or implied. In the following para-

graphs, we recapitulate them, with such supplementary

remarks as seem necessary.

1. Examination of the Role of Professionals

Ne recommend that the role that can properly be

played within the Agency by members of the organized

professions--medicine, psychiatry, psychology, law,

and others--be given careful study, within the con-

text of (a) ensuring that the Agency puts their skills

to the best possible use, and (b)

refraining from in-

volving them in matters not properly within their

professional purview.

2. Improvement of Intellectual Standards

We recommend that the Operations Directorate,

and its Clandestine Service, take whatever steps

are possible to ensure that

the intellectual caliber

of their personnel is equal to the exigencies of the

future.

We realize that the present personnel selection

system sets high standards for those entering on

duty at the professional level, particularly as

regards IQ and education.

But

the standards presently

in force do not by themselves guarantee that future

selections will possess

independence of mind, analytical

ability, and objectivity.

In the case of personnel already on board,

it should be kept in mind that we live in a

rapidly-evolving, technologically-oriented

civilization.

Knowledge and intellectual

skills adequate at this time may be inadequate

a tew years trom now.

For an intelligence or-

ganization, we define "inadequate" as anything

that is less than the best.

We suggest that a board of expert consultants
