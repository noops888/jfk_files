Introduction ‘ q

On S June 1962 Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, a Soviet 6fficial
temporarily assigned to Geneva, contacted an American Foreign
Service Officer in a move that was eventually to lead to
Nosenko's defection. This act was the first in a chain of
events that is unequaled in complexity by any other Soviet
operation handled by the Central Intelligence Agency since
its establishment. Because the case still has important
implications for the overall Soviet intelligence effort of
the United States, and because it raises many basic questions
about the techniques of handling Soviet agents and defectors,
' a reinvestigation of the case was commissioned by the Agency
i in June 1976: The results are embodied in this report and
its annexes.

Although United States officials of many agencies, up
to and including a president of the United States, were briefed
on the case and either played some role in making decisions
concerning it or actively participated in running the opera-
tion, it does not now appear that, between 1962 and 1976, any
j "single individual has ever been fully informed as to all its
: aspects. The complexity of this investigation therefore . 7
stems in large measure from the fact that the case has pro- :
ceeded along at least two, and often more, compartmented .
tracks. Thus, the effort to get a total picture of what
transpired has involved an unusual amount of research in the £
files of various components of the Agency, plus personal in-
terviews with a large number of present and former Agency
employees.

i The actions taken in regard to Nosénko were not the
result of decisions made by a unitary Agency acting as a

corporate entity; rather, in this case more than in most,
decisions were made by a number of senior individuals on the
basis of their own strongly-held views, which sometimes con-
flicted with the equally strongly-held opinions of other
senior colleagues. Thus, this report must, if it is to be ' .,
comprehensible, attempt to depict the decision-making process

in all its complexity by referring when necessary to the
individual participants. ‘ .

The quintessential quality of a report such as this
a “is that it be objective. We have not, on the other hand,
- refrained fom expressing our opinions. Even to have tried
} to do so wauid have been futile for two rather obvious
' reasons. First, into the reconstruction of events of the
complexity herein described there always enters a degree
of selectivity and judgment; in this sense, "opinion" pro-
vides the essential matrix of our product. Secondly, we
have viewed gur task as one of constructive criticism.

CHAPTER I

Organizational Background: CIA's Handling
Of Soviet Positive Intelligence and CI Natters

The history of the Nosenko case can only be comprehended
within the framework of the organization and day-to-day func-
tioning of the Central Intelligence Agency as a whole. In
fact, opinions regarding the handling of the Nosenko case may
differ substantially according to individual's differing
views regarding internal Agency organization and functioning.
This being the case, it is useful at the outset to make
explicit our understanding of how the Agency actually func-
tioned in the relevant period, the 1960s, as distinct from
how it might theoretically have functioned according to
Agency organizational charts and regulations.

The two instrumentalities for the conduct of day-to-day
operations in the Soviet field were the Soviet Bloc Division
(known successively by this and several other names*) and
the Counterintelligence Staff. In the nature and interrela-
tionship of these two organizations we find the key to much
of what was to happen in the Nosenko case.

“CI Staff" was actually a misnomer, because the organi-
zation carrying this name did not even concern itself to any
appreciable extent with the counterintelligence function of
the Agency on a worldwide basis. Rather, it concentrated on

Ss. °

wv: Bloc countries

*This area component during the period of this report was
known as Soviet Russia Division (1952-1966) and, Soviet Bloc
Division (1966-1974). The two names are often used inter-
changeably.

A third organizational participant in the Nosenko case
was the Office of Security. This office had overlapping
jurisdiction with CI Staff and, to a lesser extent, SB Division
in any matter that involved a suspected Soviet or Soviet Bloc
penetration of the Agency. While not usually a problem, the
overlapping jurisdiction was considerable in both the
Golitsyn and Nosenko cases because so much of the activity
in connection with both operations revolved around allegations
that the Soviets had penetrated the Agency at a high level.

Barer! i allegations that the Soviets had recruited
Agency staff employees did not first originate with Golitsyn,
it was he who lent special force to them by spelling out a
complicated theory of Soviet intentions and modus operandi.
He thus provided a detailed conceptual framework within which
to develop a hypothesis towards which some members of the
Agency were already predisposed. Golitsyn thus became the
ideologue's ideologue.

Prior to Golitsyn's defection, the Agency as a whole had
been hard hit by its dealings with high-level Soviet penetra-
tions of Western governments. There is no need to go into
detail on them, since they have been well documented else-
where, but they included British representatives such as
Kim Philby and George Blake. Another important penetration
was Heinz Felfe, who rose to be Deputy Chief of Soviet

Counterintelligence in the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND).
The Felfe case is particularly significant because it was
believed by a number of counterintelligence specialists in
the Agency that Felfe's career had been systematically pro-
moted by the Soviets through what came to be known as the
“throw-away" technique. According to the theory of this
group, a considerable number of valuable and productive
Soviet intelligence operations in Germany were made avail-
able to Felfe so that, by detecting them and signaling their
Prosence to the West German authorities, he could build up
is reputation as a counterintelligence specialist. While
there is debate about the value of the assets the Soviets
made available, there appears to be enough substance to this
theory for it to have had a strong impact within the Agency,
particularly upon those persons who were members of the former
Eastern European (EE) Division of the Plans Directorate.

In the course of time, the continuing record of KGB
success in penetrating Western governments made it the more
feared of the two principal Soviet intelligence services.
Although we had had our successes also in penetrating the
Soviets, they were primarily through GRU defectors-in-place
such as Popov and Penkovskiy. The defection of Anatoliy
Golitsyn on 15 December 1961 was thus a major event.

Once again, it is not necessary here to go into details
regarding Golitsyn, because this case has been covered exten-
sively in a recent study. However, two points are worth
noting:

1. First, Golitsyn was diagnosed early in

1962 as a “paranoid personality." Although account
was taken of this psychological problem, it was

<: --Gonsidered in the light of a threat to the con- : =
tinuity of the debriefing process rather than as
a factor reflecting on the validity of the purported
intelligence he gave us. It was apparently felt
that, if we could maintain his stability, we could
depend not only upon the objectively verifiable
facts he gave us but also upon his often very
theoretical generalizations.

2. Secondly, Golitsyn presented us right from
the beginning, continually elaborated throughout
the years, a complicated rationale for believing
that the KGB was successfully pursuing a mammoth
program of “disinformation” to the detriment of the

United States and its Western allies. This ratio-
nale is covered in more detail in Chapter VI of
this report.

It is against this background that we view the approach
to CIA by Nosenko and his subsequent handling. In doing so,
we shall for ease of reference from time to time allude to
the thesis regarding KGB operations and intentions--claborated
by Golitsyn and others--as the "Monster Plot." In fairness,
it must be allowed that this term was in common usage not
by the thesis' proponents but rather by its detractors; yet
no other name serves so aptly to capsulize what the theorizers
envisaged as a major threat to United States’ security. If
the term carries with it emotive connotations, the latter
were certainly shared by both sides to the controversy; and
this fact alone is enough to justify including "Monster Plot"
in the lexicon of this study.

CHAPTER II
Biographical Data: 1927-1962

Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko was born 30 October 1927 in
Nikolayev, Ukrainian SSR, son of Ivan Isidorovich Nosenko
and Tamara Georgiyevna Markovskaya. His father was born in
1902 and died on 2 August 1956. At the time of his death,
the senior Nosenko was Minister of Shipbuilding, a member
of the Central Committee of the CPSU, a deputy to the Supreme
Soviet of the USSR, and recipient of a number of the highest
Soviet awards and medals. He received a state funeral, and
he is commemorated by a plaque on the Kremlin wall. Young
Nosenko's brother, Vladimir, born in 1944, was a student at
the Institute of International Relations as of 1964.

From his birth until 1934, Nosenko lived in Nikolayev.
In 1934 he and his mother joined the senior Nosenko in
Leningrad, where the latter was working as chief engineer
at the Sudomekh shipbuilding plant. Nosenko continued his
schooling in Leningrad until late 1938, at which time he
and his mother followed the senior Nosenko to Moscow, where
he was to serve as Deputy People's Commissar of the Ship-
building Industry.

In 1941, shortly after the war broke out, Nosenko and
his mother were evacuated to Chelyabinsk in the Urals.
Nosenko stated that he and a friend tried to run off to the
front, but they were caught and returned home. At age 14
Nosenko entered a Special Naval School that, in August
1942, was relocated to Kuybyshev. Later, this school was
forced to relocate again, this time to Achinsk in Siberia.
Nosenko did not want to go to Siberia and, through the in-
fluence of his father, was accepted at the Frunze Naval
Preparatory School in Leningrad (not to‘be confused with
the Frunze Higher Naval School, also in Leningrad), which
by this time had been relocated to Baku. ie

Some time after August 1943, Nosenko tried on two
separate occasions to get to the front, but failed. He
and a friend did succeed in returning home to Moscow with-
out authorization. These escapades seem to form part of a
behavior pattern that was eventually to culminate in defec-
tion.

: By August 1944, Nosenko had resumed his studies at the
Frunze Naval Preparatory School, which had returned to its

original location in Leningrad. Cadets from this school were
sent to a forest (some two hundrec kilometers from Leningrad)
on a wood-cutting detail. In about November of that year he
wounded himself, seemingly accidentally, and was hospitalized.
He decided not to return to the Frunze Naval Preparatory
School and again, through his father's intervention in about
January 1945, entered a shipbuilding college (tekhnikum) in
Leningrad.

‘tin

ce ne
le ainat

At the end of World War 11, Nosenko returned to Moscow.
He had meanwhile obtained a certificate from the director of
the shipbuilding college that attested to his study in, and
the completion of, the tenth class.

At some time prior to July 1945, Nosenko accompanied his
father, who went to East Germany with a group of engineers.
For purposes of that trip, Nosenko received temporary rank
as an Army senior lieutenant, with appropriate documents and
uniform.

Nosenko entered the Institute of International Relations
in Moscow in July 1945. Upon completion of the second year
at the Institute, and by virtue of his participation in a
military training program roughly equivalent to the ROTC,
Nosenko received the rank of junior lieutenant in the
“administrative service" (sic). (The exact meaning of this
term is unclear.)

In 1946, according to Nosenko, he married, against his

parents' wishes, a student whom he had gotten pregnant. He H
obtained a divorce almost immediately following their marriage.

In about 1947, he married the daughter of Soviet Lieutenant ;
General (Major General, US-style) Telegin. This marriage, 4
too, was neither successful nor long-lived. Nosenko reported |
he had found his wife in bed with her brother. A girl was 3
later born with a harelip and a cleft palate. Nosenko in- Hf
sisted that this was not his child. xu

Nosenko completed a four-year course at the Institute
of International Relations, but he actually received his
diploma a year later, in 1950, because he had failed the
examination in Marxism. He had had to wait an extra year in
order to retake this examination.

In March 1951, Nosenko was assigned as an English a
language translator in naval intelligence (Naval RU),
serving first in the Far East. While on leave in Moscow

(late April 1952), he developed an illness that caused him
to cough up blood, and he entered a tuberculosis sanatorium
near Moscow for treatment. For reasons of health, he did
not return to the Far East but was sent instead to the
Baltic area.

While on leave in Moscow in late 1952, Nosenko accompanied
his parents to a New Year's Eve party at the dacha of a
certain General Bogdan Zakharovich Kobulov. When Nosenko
indicated interest in changing jobs, the genezal made a vague
offer of help in getting employment with the Ministry of State
Security (MGB). In March 1953, while again in Moscow, Nosenko
was called to Kobulov's office. Kobulov had just returned
from Germany to become the First Deputy Minister of the MVD
(Ministry of Internal Affairs). Nosenko did not see Kobulov
personally but was referred by the latter's assistant to the
deputy chief of the Second Chief Directorate (internal coun-
terintelligence), hereafter referred to as SCD, by whom he
was hired.

His first MGB assignment was in the First (American
embassy) Section of the First (American) Department of the

In March 1953, following Stalin's death, Lavrentiy
Beriya emerged from the resultant reshuffling of the top
leadership as chief of both the MVD and NGB. In March 1954,
the new "Committee" for State Security--the KGB--was formed.

In June 1953 Nosenko married his third wife, Lyudmila
Yulianovna Khozhevnikova, who was a student at the Moscow
State University.

Nosenko, a member of the Komsomol since 1943, was
elected secretary of the SCD Komsomol unit in June 1953 and
served as secretary of that unit until about June 1954. :
However, earlier in 1954, Nosenko had contracted venereal q
disease and gone to a clinic; to disguise his identity, he :
used operational documentation in alias in applying for
treatment. When he did not go back for final treatment
as instructed, the clinic sent a letter to his ostensible 1
Place of work as shown on the alias document. The MVD found
out about this improper use of alias documentation and re-
ported it to the SCD. Nosenko was not only disciplined
by the chief, SCD (reprimanded and placed under arrest for
15 days), but the Komsonol also removed him as secretary
and expelled him from its organization.

In early spring 1955, Nosenko received a poor
kharakteristika (performance evaluation), which described
i him as unsuitable for work in the First Department. None-
H theless, he was neither dismissed nor transferred. .

Although Nosenko survived the 1954 episode as well as
. the poor performance report, these events caused him to go Hl
| on what he has described as a "big drunk," which resulted
. in his having to spend a month under hospital care. To {
keep Nosenko out of further trouble, his mother intervened i
by making a telephone call to Petr Vasilyevich Fedotov, | H
chief of the SCD. Seemingly as a result of her efforts, |
Nosenko was transferred in the latter part of May 1955 to
the Second Section (which operated against tourists) of
7 the Seventh Department, SCD. In late 1955, Lieutenant }
General Oleg Mikhaylovich Gribanov was appointed chief of fi :
the SCD. From a number of indications, Nosenko's relation- i
ship with Gribanov developed, despite the difference in rank
i and position, into a social relationship involving evenings |

on the town together, heavy drinking, and women. Despite i

numerous indiscretions, Nosenko's survival within the KGB
and his subsequent promotions to increasingly responsible
positions may well have resulted in part from Gribanov's
patronage. To a considerable degree, of course, his rise
must also be attributed to his being the son of a highly-
placed member of the Soviet government.

At this point in his KGB career, Nosenko had lost his

Komsomol membership and not achieved CP-member status. It

was not until 1956 that he was accepted as a candidate mem-
«>. ber of the CP, and only in 1957 that he was admitted as a

full Party member. Once this happened, according to Nosenko, |

the Komsomol removed its reprimand from his file.

In December 1959, Nosenko was promoted to the rank of
captain. He held this rank until his défection in February
1964, despite having been promised he would be promoted and
the fact that he had held several positions that were
usually filled by officers of higher military rank.

Nosenko worked in the Seventh Department, SCD until
t January 1960, when he was transferred back to the First
j Section (American embassy) of the First Department. Then
he held the position of a deputy chief of the First Section.
i He was retransferred back to the Seventh Department as of
late December 196l-early January 1962. In July 1962, he
was appointed deputy chief of the Seventh Department. He

continued in this position until 18 January 1964, the date
he left Moscow on TDY to Geneva.

Nosenko defected in Geneva on 4 February 1964, leaving
behind in Moscow his wife, Lyudmila, and two daughters.
His prior travels to the West had included two TDYs to
England in 1957 and 1958, a TDY to Cuba in 1960, and the
first TDY to Geneva from mid-March until June 1962. He
also went on TDY to Bulgaria in 1961. Details of his de-

fection and subsequent developments are covered in Chapter
Ill.

CHAPTER IIT
Chronicle: 1962-1969

: A. Initial Contacts

When Nosenko first approached the CIA on 9 June
1962, he had been assigned, as a representative of the
H KGB Second Chief Directorate, to be security officer of
i the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament Conference
i being held in the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Taking
i advantage of the fact that he was the watchdog for the
delegation’ whereas its members could not watch him,
Nosenko used his freedom of movement to approach the
Agency, ostensibly for personal financial assistance.

As he told it, Nosenko had recently slept with a
Swiss woman who had stolen 900 Swiss Francs of official
funds that he had on his person at the time; inability
to reimburse this relatively trivial amount (about US
$250 at the time) would jeopardize his career. In ex-
change for 2,000 Swiss Francs, he therefore proposed
that he provide us with two items of information,
These items, subsequently verified, related to:

1. KGB recruitment of a US Army sergeant
while he was serving in the American embassy
in Moscow as a "code machine repairman."

had ostensibly recruited but who was being
run against us under KGB control.

At this time Nosenko was not forthcoming in response
to general intelligence requirements on which we tried to
quiz him, excluded the possibility of becoming an agent,
and flatly refused to consider meeting Agency representa-
tives inside the USSR. Nevertheless, he “agreed 'perhaps'
meet us when abroad" again at a later date. For our part,
our interest in him was whetted by his identification of
his deceased father as a former minister of the USSR.

In addition, such information as he gave about himself
indicated that he would be of high operational interest.
Inter alia his most recent assignment in Moscow was as
head of a KGB sub-section working against American
tourists.

B. Bona Fides
_By 11 June, the two case officers (one a native
Russian speaker) who were hasdling Nosenko sent a
cable to Headquarters that read in part:

SUBJ CONCLUSIVELY PROVED BONA FIDES. PRO-
VIDED INFO OF IMPORTANCE AND SENSITIVITY, :
SUBJ NOW COMPLETELY COOPERATIVE. WILLING :
MEET WHEN ABROAD AND WILL MEET AS OFTEN AND !
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE UNTIL DEPARTURE 15 JUNE. §

et eee

With the question of bona fides seemingly resolved,
the principal case officer flew to Washington carrying
the tapes of the meeting. His arrival and sojourn at
Headquarters were described by Chief, CI on 23 July 1976
as follows:

Chief, CI:

Chief, CI:

+ + » we got the first message . . . on
Nosenko from Geneva, and [the principal
case officer] was ordered back, and we

had a big meeting here on Saturday morning,
and [the principal case officer] thought
he had the biggest fish of his life. I
mean he really did . . . and everything I
heard from him was in direct contrast from
what we heard from Golitsyn. I mean, we
had no agents, this, that and... yet
here was a Second Chief Directorate man

in Geneva peace talks on disarmament.

So I got hold of [the principal case of-
ficerj, and I brought him in here on a
weekend.

What you're saying is that it was unreason-
able for a Second Chief"Directorate man to
be there... :

Under the circumstances, getting drunk and
needing $300 to. . . "not to be recruited
but to give us three full, big secrets"
for an exchange for the money in order
that he could replenish the account from
which he embezzled the money on a drunk.

10 to 1S volunes of Golitsyn's interroga-
tion, without prejudicing him in any way,
just to read it, and he had all the
books out, and at the end of it all he
Said that there was no question about it,
that they were being had. I mean, mind
you, he was of split motivation because
this was the big case of his entire life
and yet there he was reading material,
etc. So we went to Dick [Helms, then
DDP] and we put up a proposition that we
should permit Golitsyn to read the real
material, I mean the transcripts and
everything from Nosenko. And he wouldn't
agree to that, but we made a compromise
and that was to take the material and
falsify it as though it was an anonymous
letter sent to the embassy by an alleged
KGB person. So the anonymous letter was
drawn up, and {the principal case officer}
interviewed Golitsyn with the anonymous
letter, and Golitsyn’s statement was that
“this is a person under control, I want
to see the letter" which created a situa-
tion because we didn't have a letter.

But he began to point out in sone detail
exactly what was instigating and inspiring--
in terms of what he'd already given to us
and he very wisely stated that he wanted
everything on tape, because he knew that
as time passed in hundreds of interviews
and their counteraction took place, there
would be people accusing him of not having
divulged certain information.

The principal case officer's réview of the Golitsyn
information had indeed converted him to the view that
Nosenko's defection was bogus. Equally convinced, as
clearly indicated by a number of documents that he
drafted, was his superior, the person who had become
Chief, SR Division in December 1963. The reasons for
Chief, SR's conviction may not have been the same as
the principal case officer's, but for all practical pur-
poses the views of the two men at the time were identical.

A joint CI Staff-SR Division recommendation was
therefore made to Richard Helms, the Deputy for Plans,

.

that the transcripts of the Nosenko debriefings be

made available to Golitsyn for comment. Helms agreed,
with the single reservation that Nosenke not be identi-
fied by name as the source. As a result, a number of
items of information from Nosenko were embodied on a
letter ostensibly stemming from an anonymous KGB source;
in this form, it was assumed, the information could be
shown to Golitsyn without disclosing the source. (This
ruse seemed plausible enough, since a previous defector,
Michal Goleniewski, had written CIA a number of anony-
mous letters before eventually defecting and disclosing
his identity.)

In carrying out the plan, the principal case offi-
cer made his own views clear to Golitsyn:

TF told [Golitsyn] that . . . I thought it quite
possible, in view of his own statements about
disinformation, that this was the beginning of
a disinformation operation possibly relating to
his] defection.

Golitsyn felt, in general and without having
the full details necessary to an assessment,
that there were indeed serious signs of disin-
formation in this affair. He felt such a dis-
information operation, to discredit him, was a
likelihood, as he had earlier said. A KGB of-
ficer could be permitted to tell everything he
knew, now, if he worked in the same general
field as Golitsyn had. When told that so far
this source had not done anything to discredit
Golitsyn, and had in fact reported that the KGB
is greatly upset about Golitsyn's defection,
and asked what he thought the purposes of such
a disinformation operation now might be,
Golitsyn agreed that kidnapping was a likely
one, “to arrange an exchange for me.” Also,

to divert our attention from investigations

of his leads by throwing up false scents, and
to protect their remaining sources. He also
added, "There could be other aims as well. The
matter should be looked into. It seems serious
to me." He thought the KGB might allow a first
series of direct meetings with the KGB officer,
to build up our confidence, and then in the —
next session do whatever the operation's purpose

might be (discredit Golitsyn, kidnap, pass
serious disinformation items, etc.).

The Case Against Nosenko

During the remainder of 1962 and 1963, SR Division
continued to build up a case against Nosenko. Virtually
any information provided by Nosenko, or action taken by
him, was interpreted as part of a KGB “provocation.”

If his information was in accord with that from other
sources, this fact not only confirmed our suspicion of
Nosenko but was interpreted as casting doubt on the
other sources as well.

While the above aspect will be covered at length
in Chapters V and VI, one example will serve to highlight
the attitude that prevailed. Nosenko had, during our
meetings with him in 1962, contributed information that
materially aided in the identification and arrest of
William John Christopher Vassall, a British Admiralty
official who was also a KGB agent. Because Golitsyn
had previously provided similar, but less specific,
information, the usefulness of Nosenko's intelligence
was discounted; once Vassall had been identified, it
was concluded that Nosenko had been allowed to expose
him in order to support his own bona fides. The argu-
ment ran that Vassall would in any case have been identi-
fied sooner or later on the basis of Golitsyn's leads.

,
In January 1964, Nosenko reappeared in Geneva ac-

“--companying another Soviet delegation. By now, the case

against him had been well established in the minds of
those dealing with the matter, and the record is there-
fore replete with manifestations of suspicion. A particu-
lar example of our tendency to interpret unfavorably al-
most anything Nosenko said is provided by notes that
Chief, SR forwarded to Helms on 27 January 1964, with
the suggestion that they "convey very well the flavor
of the man... and the complexities of the operation."
By way of background, although Nosenko's cryptonym at
this juncti FOXTROT, he had previously been
designated |. This bit of history led to the
following incident during a safehouse meeting:

face lit up and he said with a smile, "Ha.
You are | i

but it is not funny as AEFOXTROT
seemed to think it was and 1
eans that he knows his own CIA

cryptonym.

The above incident cxemplifies a main theme that CIA
was itself penetrated. This fear had existed before
Golitsyn defected, but it was fed constantly by the lat-
ter's allegations that information concerning him was
leaking to the KGB, and the conclusion that the leaks
must have originated within the Agency.

Thus it was that a memorandum from Chief, SR on 27
January 1964, submitted to and approved by Helms, began
as follows:

Our goal in this case must be eventually to
break Subject and learn from him the details
of his mission and its relation to possible
penetrations of US intelligence and security
agencies and those of allied nations as well
as to broader disinformation operations in
the political sphere. Ideally, our interests
would be best served if Subject were broken
as early as possible but since this is
unlikely, our actions must be conceived and
carried out in a manner which contributes to
our basic goal without alerting Subject unduly
at any stage. :
Far from “alerting Subject unduly," on the surface
the Agency welcomed Nosenko with both cordiality and
generosity. The following excerpts from a 30 January
1964 meeting make the point clearly:

Nosenko: . . . the only thing I wanted to know and
I asked this question, “What should I ex-
pect in the future?"

Principal case officer:

The following awaits: As I presented it,

have some job, some chance of a future
life, which gives you security and if
possible the opportunity to work in this
field which you know. Is that correct?

Nosenko: Absolutely.
Principal case officer:

Mr. Helms said yes, flatly absolutely yes,
in fact I would say enthusiastic...
that's the only word to describe it. We
talked about, and since this was a business
discussion I'll repeat all of it whether
it was pleasant or unpleasant. So the next
thing will be some details that we spoke

certain personal independence. Because of
the very great assistance you've been to us
already and because of this desire to give
you a backing, they will give you a little
additional personal security . . . [salary
details follow}.

Defection

As might be expected, the principal case officer
devoted a good deal of effort during the second Geneva
visit to persuading Nosenko to stay in place. Nosenko,
however, dismissed out of hand the possibility of remain-
ing in contact with CIA from within the Soviet Union,
and he became increasingly anxious to defect immediately.
When the principal case officer continued to press him
to remain in Geneva long enough to effect an audio pene-
tration of the local rezidentura, Nosenko forced the
issue. At a meeting on 7 February, he announced that a
cable had been received from Moscow ordering him back
home for a “tourism conference." Though this claim was
subsequently to be the source of almost endless contro-
versy, it was accepted at the time without apparent
question. Preparations therefore immediately began for
evacuation to the United States.

A layover in another country en route to the United
States lasted about a fortnight. It was used for further

statement that he had suspected Subject from
the very first meeting on the basis of Subject's

statement announcing his intention to defect.

After my talks with the case officers, i had
my first visit with Subject at the safehouse.

This lasted from 2000 to 2230 and included
dinner with Subject and the case officers.
Conversation during this first mecting was ister
& general in nature and followed no special
agenda. However, it did give me an oppor-
tunity to. take Subject's measure. I started
by telling Subject that I had come to form my
own impressions of him as a person and an
intelligence officer who desired to place his
knowledge and experience at the disposal of
the United States government. I added that
I wished to determine for myself why Subject
had come to the West, a most serious step
which. neither we nor Subject should under-
estimate in terms of its lasting effect on
Subject's own life and those of his family
left behind. Subject rose to this opening by
first assuring me in a most fawning manner
. that he, as an intelligence officer. fully
: understood the need for a senior officer to
make his own judgments on the spot. He then
went on to explain his motivation for first
contacting us, his reasons for defecting and
his intense desire to collaborate with us in
Soviet operations sin-e he has no specialty
other than intelligence. These remarks were
repetitious of his original statements
delivered in the same mechanical fashion, the
major difference being that Subject was intensely
nervous at the outset, calming down only after
it appeared that I was accepting his statements
at face value.

| By the end of the evening I had come to the
1 same conclusions reached by [the principal

are treated in detail in a separate memorandum. i
However, in reaching them, I was beset by a
sense of irritation at the KGB's obvious con-
viction they could pull off an operation like
this successfully and by a feeling of distaste
for the obvious and transparent manner in which
Subject played his role.
Hi
*

Chief, SR's distaste was sufficient to overcome any
interest he might otherwise have had in a recruitment
opportunity suggested by Nosenko:

One other subject touched upon... was the

sion that recruitment is part of the
plan and that we Would succeed no matter how
half-heartedly we tried.

Despite his misgivings, however, Chief, SR remained
convinced thet the Agency must continue to dissemble:

It will be necessary to maintain an effective
degree of secrecy with regard to our knowledge
of Subject's true status and our plans to try
to secure from him a full confession. If
Subject, or the Soviets, become aware of our
intentions, we will probably be forced to act
_ prematurely.

With these considerations in mind, he therefore re-
newed the commitments previously made by the principal
case officer: °

I informed Subject that I was satisfied that he

On 12 February, consistent with the above commitments,
Nosenko was flown to the Washington area and lodged in a
safehouse, under close supervision of the Office of
Security. Now that he was in the United States, the
Agency (and the US government as a whole) found them-
selves faced with a seeming dilemma, much more crucial
than the problems facing them while he remained abroad. :

The Agency's perception of the dilemma, and the possible
solutions to it, are covered in paragraphs 3, 4, 6 and
7 of a memorandum written by Chief, SR and approved by
Helms on 17 February 1964:

While admitting that Subject is here on a KGB
directed mission, it has been generally agreed
by both us and the FBI that he still possesses
valid information which we would like to obtain.
At the same time, we, at least, believe that
Subject must be broken at some point if we are
to learn something of the full scope of the
KGB plan, the timing for its execution, and
the role played by others in it. In addition,
we must have this information if we are to
decide what countermeasures we should take in
terms of counter-propaganda, modifications in
our ‘security practices, and planning for future
fi operations against the Soviet target. Admittedly,
our desire to continue debriefing to obtain
additional information may conflict with the
need to break Subject. Clearly, the big problem
is one of timing. How long can we keep Subject,
or his KGB controllers, ignorant of our aware-
ness of this operation and how long will it
take us to assemble the kind of brief we will
need.to initiate a hostile interrogation in
conditions of maximum control?
If we are to proceed along the lines indicated
above we should accept in advance the premise
that we will not be able to prevent Subject
from evading our custody or communicating with
the Soviets unless we place him under such
physical restraint that it will become immedi-
ately apparent to him that we Suspect him.
This may not be an acceptable risk and if it is
not, we should so determine right away and
decide on a completely different course of
action. If this is to be the case, we should
agree to forego additional debriefings, place
Subject in escape-proof quarters away from the
Washington area under full-time guard and com-
mence hostile debriefing on the basis of the
material we already have (although the prospects
for success would not be great). Disposal would
probably be via Berlin followed by a brief press

release to the effect that Subject had con-
fessed to being a plant and had been allowed to
return to Soviet control. [In the meantime,

_ SR Division would:]

--Advise Subject that during this phase he will
continue to live and work in the safehouse
and will be escorted at all times when on
shopping trips, visits to movies, etc.,
because of his faulty English and unfamil-
iarity with the country, customs, etc.

While we can explain this regime as needed
for his security, we cannot keep him locked
up in the house 24 hours a day.

>-Make available to Subject a portion of the
{money} promised him «hich he can use for
purchases of clothes, cigarettes, personal
effects, etc.

--Agree that whenever this first phase is over
(four to six weeks) that he be permitted to
take a two-week vacation with escort.

The vacation period will be of greater benefit to
us since it will provide us with an opportunity
to review and make judgments on the value of the
information already obtained and also to con-
sider the progress made in the other aspects of
the case outlined below. During the vacation we
can decide whether we should proceed to the
second phase or are ready to commence hostile
interrogation under controlled conditions. I£
it is the former, we will have to reckon with
the need to modify the living and working
arrangements for Subject in a way which will
inevitably give him some additional freedom.

will be terribly important to make the proy2r
decision at the end of phase one.

This decision will depend not only on our
evaluation of the material obtained during

the debriefings but on how far we have been
able to go in clarifying other cases which

are related to Subject case and form an impor-
tant part of any explanation of the KGB's goals
in this operation.

Thus, Nosenko was surrounded from the first with ambi-
valence and uncertainty. On the one hand, he was housed
in circumstances that his principal day-to-day handler
describes as “our typical, luxurious style..." He
continues by saying that "there was all the food and drink
one- could possibly want . . . I remember all of the effort
and the money we spen: to get a billiard table...

On the other hand, this handler, who was assigned to this
case after having worked on the Golitsyn affair, was told
at the outset that eee was “dirty, that he had been
sent by the KGB. .

Writing of his first meeting with Nosenko on 13
pepruetie the handler recorded his first impressions of
losenko:

In this brief meeting lasting actually less than
two hours, I couldn't prevent myself from

putting him in three ,successive categories.

In the first few minutes I put him in the cate-
gory of a Cuban exile living in the Harlem section
of New York City. This impression came to my
mind strictly on the basis of his clothing (dark
trousers and sport shirt, black elevated shoes, :
sharply pointed and with a design) and his i
mannerisms . . .

Half way through the session I put him in the
category of a big city but small-time con man. ‘
While dictating . . . from his notes, he knew

exactly what he wanted to say and how he wanted

to say it. But when I had brief conversations

with him on other topics, or when I saw him

stealing glances in my direction to size me up, .
I could almost see the con man's wheels turning

tapidly in his head. I had an urge to check my

wallet just to make sure it was still safe. H

As the session ended and we moved into the
living room J put him in a third category.
Before leaving the debriefing room I noticed coe
how he touched [another case officer] on the
» shoulder. When [that case officer] went down-
’ stairs for a few minutes, [Nosenko] and I
walked into the living room. During that
~+ brief walk I decided to give him a President i
Johnson handshake (hand and elbow grasp, Texas ities
style) on departure and a few sincere words
about how pleased I was to meet and talk with i:
him, but his actions soon changed my mind. ss
As soon as we reached the middle of the living
room he gave me an unexpected and prolonged
hug around the shoulders and waist, the type
that one man gives another well known to hin
only after some achievement such as making
the ‘decisive point in a football game. His
embrace really took me by surprise and I had
to pull away from him without hurting his
feelings. At this point I realized that I
couldn't go through with the President Johnson
handshake; he'd have to settle for less. In
this, the third category, I saw him as a jazz
musician who sells heroin on the side and has
homosexual tendencies.

A week later, on 20 February, however, the handler
reported more favorable impressions, those of the Office
of Security personnel assigned to guard Nosenké at the
safehouse: z
Subject is not at all concerned about his own
security or the threat of assassination or
kidnapping. He seems to think the present
security system is fine . . . [This was in
marked contrast to Golitsyn's behavior.]

Subject is not a heavy drinker and is never i
“under the influence" . . .

Subject is not a heavy smoker . . .
At mealtime Subject sits at the dining table

j the Olympics on TV Subject never once commented : 3

including the housekeepers. Compared with other
cases he is ideal. He is polite, likes to kid,
doesn't have a drinking problem, doesn't have

a mental problem, and wants to become an
American and work like and with Americans as
soon as possible.

Subject became angry only once and even then it

was not a loss of temper in the true sense.

The day that [the principal case officer] dis-

cussed the schedule with him, Subject’ became

moody and started to drink alone. He told the

wards that he wants to use his brains and work

ard as Americans do. He feels that the present

schedule does not utilize his talent to the

fullest. ‘|

The "schedule" referred to above had been outlined to
Nosenko in a 17 February meeting, during which the 7
principal case officer had assured him that "both [Chief,
SR] and myself are enthusiastically optimistic about

future cooperation with him in operations against the
USSR." Nosenko greeted plans for a period devoted to
systematic debriefing with the statement that this

“might represent an attempt to extract all his informa-
tion from him, after which he would not be needed.”

He also said he needed a vacation at “an early date

in order to help him forget and get over the strain

and worry of his abrupt change of situation, particularly
the strain of leaving his family behind."

The Problem of Disposition

Far from being optimistic about our “cooperation”
with Nosenko, SR Division was discussing the possibility
of forcibly returning him to the Soviets if the “overall
effort to break him" came to naught. In addition,-an
alternative plan was being developed for the incarcera-
tion of Nosenko, so that “there can be no question of
{his] escaping after he becomes aware of our attitude."
Finally, it was agreed that Golitsyn, who had meanwhile
recognized Nosenko a: the author of the ostensible
“anonymous letter" of 26 June 1962, would be brought
into the operation to back up our interrogation. Helms
originally had some misgivings about this procedure but
appears eventually to have agreed to giving Golitsyn
“full access" to material from Nosenko, but not to
Nosenko himself.

The FBI viewed Nosenko much more favorably than
did CIA. As early as 8 February 1964, Chief, CI had
sent a cable reading in part: qi

- . . (FBI liaison officer] STATED . . . THAT
FRIEND OF HIS WHO IS EXPERT IN.FBI QUICKLY
SCANNED AEFOXTROT PRODUCTION AND CAUTIONED _
US THAT "IT LOOKS VERY GOOD" IN TERMS OF CASES
KNOWN TO THEM.

Later, in a memorandum to Helms on 9 March, Chief, SR
stated that "the FBI personnel on the case have so far
indicated they believe Subject to be a genuine KGB
defector." By implication, both Chief, SR and Chief, CI
regarded this divergence of view as a serious problem.
Their concern is understandable, because a subsequent
paragraph of the Chief, SR memorandum contained plans
for the following action, to be initiated around 1 April

1964, which would not be appropriate if CIA were
forced, as a result of inter-agency consultations,
to treat Nosenko as a bona fice defector:

a. Subject to be moved to a high
security safehouse under maximum guard.

b. The DCI to inform the President,
Secretary of State, Director, FBI, and
USIB principals that Subject is a KGB
plant whom we intend to return to Soviet
control after (1) trying to break hin,
and (2) publicizing his case.

c. Retain Subject incommunicado for
about three weeks during which time we will
continue efforts to break him.

d. At the same time, commence the
publicity campaign which will precede
Subject's deportation. As a first step,
there will be a brief official announcement
probably by a State Department spokesman
to the effect that Subject has confessed
to having faked his defection at KGB
direction in order (1) to penetrate US
intelligence and security agencies, and (2)
to discredit the act of defection by Soviet
citizens. At the same time, a press back-
grounder will be made available which will
characterize this KGB operation as an act of
desperation following a decade.of defection
and disloyalty to the regime on the part of
a score of senior Soviet intelligence of-
ficers .. - i

Erratic Behavior and Its Aftermath

While planning was going on for his confinement
and hostile interrogation, Nosenko was taken on a trip
for two weeks’ relaxation, beginning on 12 March. During
this period, his consumption of alcohol was enormous, and
his behavior became increasingly erratic. Prior to his
departure, he had on several occasions been violent; on
one occasion he took a swipe with his fist at the princi-
pal case officer and on another tried to strangle one of
the Office of Security escorts...

The handler who spent the first part of the
vacation with Nosenko recorded these impressions:

In my opinion Subject is under extreme ten-
sion and pressure. Any man who skips break-
fast and starts the day off with alcohol

is on his way to becoming an alcoholic.

He drinks not for the enjoyment of it, but
with an attempt to erase or lessen problems
of a serious nature. I suspect that these
tensions are the result of two things:

one, fear on his part that he cannot follow
through with his assignment; and, two, his
homosexual desires. I predict that the
situation will not improve but grow worse.

Yet the handler concluded on the following note:

Despite our oral arguments and the various
incidents we experienced, Subject and I
parted on the best of terms. He gave me an
affectionate embrace on the night of my
departure, and in front of [the principal
case officer] thanked me for my attention
to his needs and patience in dealing with
him. We agreed to see each other upon his
return to Washington.

During the last half of the vacation, the principal
case officer arrived and took charge of the escort team.
Nosenko was more restrained in his presence than he had
been previously, but the principal case officer had no
success in eliciting information from him during tlis
period. Not only was Nosenko uninformative, according
to the principal case officer, but he was also very tense
and unable to sleep more than a few*hours at a time.

Although debriefing was resumed upon returning to
Washington, it cannot have been very successful. Nosenko
was still drinking enormously and had by now discovered
unfettered night life; it is doubtful that he was physi-
ber able to respond meaningfully to interrogation during
the day.

On 30 March 1964, Chief, SR wrote a memorandum to
Helms entitled "Final Phase Planning," which Helms
initialed and returned without written comment. Inter

We have concluded that there is little to
be gained by prolonging the status quo
beyond next weekend and every reason to
suspect that if Subject learns we doubt
him, he will try to escape. Accordingly,
we have instructed the security guards to
be alert to any attempts on Subject's part
to elude them. . .

Further scheduling must depend in consider-
able degree on the results of the interroga-
tion.- However, since we do not anticipate
that Nosenko will ever break to the point of
becoming completely cooperative, and since

we must assume that within five or six days
after the confrontation begins, news of our
action will have leaked out throug: the
briefings (however necessary they may have
been), we should be ready to take this action:

Since failure to "break" Nosenko--i.e., force
him to admit that he had come to us not as a genuine

virtually certain, plans were also being laid to re-
turn him to the Soviet authorities. Before doing
this, however, it would be necessary to:

probiems which might be encountered in ar-
Tanging Nosenko's deportation. The simplest
method still appears to be [flying him] to
Tempelhof in Berlin. Thence to S-Bahnhof
: Tiergarten where Subject, in his best
civilian clothes, with diplomatic passport,
would be placed on an S-Bahn which then
stops inside East Berlin only at the control
point S-Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse.

G. The Decision to Incarcerate

Although Nosenko had already contributed con-
siderable intelligence of value (see Chapter IV), in-

Vassall in 1962, there is no indication in the files
from this period that the possibility of his being a
bona fide defector was given any credence whatsoever,
either within the Agency or in discussions with other
parts of the government.

guilt had been established. Nevertheless, even while
Chief, SR was registering with certainty his lack of
hope for a favorable resolution, plans were drawn up

for an “arrest,” strict confinement.:and hostile interro-

gation.

The long-delayed polygraph evaluation was administered
on 4 April 1964. It did not, however, take place under
standard conditions. In his report of 8 April 1964, the

polygraph operator stated:

,During the pre- polygraph conferences with repre-
’sentatives of SR Division, the undersigned was
informed that the polygraph interview was part
of an overall plan to help break Subject and
elicit the truth from him. SR Division's

H. First Polygraph Examination i

Despite the unusual circumstances surrounding the
examination, the polygraph operator's conclusions, as
stated in his report of 8 April 1964, were categorical:

It is the undersigned's conclusion that Subject .
is not a bona fide defector, but is a dispatched H
agent sent by Soviet Intelligence for a specific : : j
mission or missions. q

i
'
{
|
{
| According to the pre-agreed upon plan, the 4
Hf different phases involving various pertinent :
} areas were covered with Subject polygraphically. : ‘
{ Challenge of Subject's reactions was indirect :
and "soft." On no occasion did Subject even
| eet te to volunteer any explanation of the
possible causes for his polygraph reactions.
| He continually denied and refused to admit

that there was anything to any of the ques- i
tions which were asked of him. When the final ‘
test questions were completed and a record was
obtained of all of Subject's polygraphic re-
sponses, the nature of the challenge and
probing was changed.

Subject was told that he was lying to numerous
pertinent questions and was accused of being

SECRET

a dispatched agent. Subject's only explanation
to the undersigned's direct accusation was that
he could not be a dispatched agent because of
the amount of information he had volunteered to
American Intelligence.

After completion of the interview, the SR repre-
sentative at the safesite was informed, in front
of Subject, of the undersigned's opinion that
Subject was lying and was a dispatched Soviet
agent. The Subject was taken into protective
custody and escorted to his new place of resi-
dence.

Once arrived at the place of confinement, Nosenko
was confronted by the principal case officer who broke
the news that Nosenko had been under suspicion since,
1962. The record of the meeting, a stormy one, is too
long to reproduce here, but the foilowing excerpt will
convey its tone:

Principal case officer: ‘

1964 is prepared, based on disinformation .
All disinformation is true in parts. That's
all right, we know that. Now if we can
talk--what I want to do is talk the real

truth . . . We want to talk about the opera-

tion which sent you and others tous .. .

Nosenko: (In Russian) .. . I don't understand. What

has happened? What has happened? What's the

matter? I don't understand.

Principal case officer:
What happened in 1962?
Nosenko: What happened in general?
Principal case officer:
Your operation was known from the beginning.

Nosenko: (In Russian) I can't understand anything.
I give you my word, but then my.word means
nothing to you. I can't understand anything.
All that I could do I tried to do. I tried
to do it for my soul.

Chief, SR reported these subsequent developments as
he saw them to Helms on 7 April:

The results of the polygraph were reviewed with
the DDP on the basis of our sessions on 6 April
with the polygraph examiner. He obtained [ |

\ but also uncovered for us that
Subject is somenow concerned about his biography.

We were all gratified by the fact that Subject
was ready and eager to explain himself and in
responding to questions under tense cross-
examination, particularly with regard to the
sourcing of some of his information, he became
quite erratic, contradicted himself many times
and became upset physically.

As a result of this session, we know that
Subject can be thrown off balance by aggres-
sive questioning in those areas which we know
to be important parts of the entire KGB opera-
tion. Thus, we will continue along these
lines for several days with a specific inter-
rogation plan mapped out for each session.

Fon

Whether Helms was informed of the peculiar conditions
under which the polygraph was administered cannot be as-
certained from the record. Chief, SR simply told him
that the examiner had "obtained significant reactions"
and that "Subject can be thrown off balance . . . In
this connection, it is useful to note here that, in a
number of documents related to this case, this polygraph
examination is referred to as valid evidence of Nosenko's
duplicity, without giving the reader any hint of the
unusual circumstances surrounding it. Even in the lengthy
study of February 1967 (commonly referred to as "the
thousand-page paper"), and in the shorter "green book"
formally published in February 1968, one finds no
cautionary notes. To put in perspective the developments
of this case, both those already reported and those still
to come, we Shall therefore jump ahead briefly to quote
from a formal Office of Security report covering a review
of the 1964 examination. The senior of the three poly-
graph specialists who reviewed it stated his conclusions
as follows, in a memorandum dated 1 November 1966:

Even without the review by reviewing examiners,
1 considered the formal report dated 8 April
1964 to have been in error in that the con-
clusions reached in the case were a gross
misinterpretation of the extent to which the
reactions added up. In fact, in some instances
the Subject was deemed to be lying when it is
known he was telling the truth. with the re-
view by the reviewing examiners, I can conclude
only that the initial examiner did exactly what
the requestor asked; i.e., he was told to
collect reactions and he did. The fact that
reactions were not consistent (and indeed may
not have occurred) was not important since it
had already been decided Subject was wrong and
the polygraph was used only to support his de-
cision.

Incarceration and Interrogation .

Many aspects of this case did not go according to

plan, but one that did was the incarceration of Nosenko.
An Office of Security representative who periodically
guarded Nosenko from November 1964 to May 1968, when
questioned on 21 July 1376, described the regime as
follows:

Security Officer (SO):

$0:

nace Hnten mn

While he was [incarcerated], he was being held

in a room in an old safehouse down there . . .

it was an attic room . . . and he was afforded

24 hours visual custody observance by the security
team.

What does visual custody observance mean? You
mean there's somebody in the room with him?

No, the room had a special door. The top half
of the door was a metal screen type where we
were actually positioned outside the door on a
24-hour basis. There were two security escorts
on duty 24 hours a day, and we were instructed
to maintain visual observance of him--just ob-
serve his activities. -

Q: Now, what was the purpose of visually observing
him 24 hours a day?

SO: Apparently to see that he made no attempts to
escape, made no attempts to injure himself.
There were never any problems along these lines.

For much of his confinement, the principal break i
in a day's monotony occurred when Nosenko was under t
interrogation. It is not necessary here to cover the 4 a
various interrogations in detail; suffice it to say that, ot i
although they were conducted fitfully, with bursts of :
activity followed by long periods of quiescence, almost i
every technique of interrogation short of physical violence ‘
was either tried or at least considered. A few of the '
high points will be summarized in the succeeding para-
graphs. — !

mage teslanlatettor se

Meanwhile, Golitsyn had been brought into the case
and was being employed as a behind-the-scenes consultant : H
in connection with the interrogations. Golitsyn was :
given for analysis voluminous material relating to the i ily
case and was told that "one of the most perplexing aspects
of the Nosenko case to us-‘at the present time is not 7
whether he was sent (we all certainly agree with your
view that he was sent on a mission) but the exact nature

of his service with the KGB." Golitsyn's role will
be covered more thoroughly in a separate chapter.

To ensure cooperation in the interrogation, an
"Outline of Action to be Taken Should Subject Refuse
to Answer Requirements" was drawn up on 25 August 1964.
The tenor of this outline, which essentially set the :
basic until late 1967, is i.

Full Success: .If Subject confesses fully, he will
have broken with the KGB and will become depen-
dent upon us for. his security and well-being.
After full debriefing and establishment of bona
fides he will presumably be returned to a con-
Ventional safehouse and a life similar to the
January to April 1964 period in which he will
be permitted to go out with a security escort
we we continue his exploitation and plan his
‘uture. 7

Partial Success: If Subject makes significant
admissions and falls back on a second level
cover story, he will be kept in the present
safehouse. His personal circumstances and
intensity of interrogation will be determined
by the situation obtaining at that time.

Failure: If the interrogation fails, we would
plan to put him “on ice" for a period, then
interrogate him again. For this interim period,
Subject would be transferred to visibly more

The possible outcomes foreseen as a result of the interro-
gation were also based on the assumption that he had been
lying about his reasons for coming to us:

permanent and more secure quarters. From the ‘ Hit
makeshift physical set up of his ;resert eee :
quarters, the large number of guards who rotate

weekly and the round-the-clock visual observa- i
tion by two guards, it is obvious to Subject

that his quarters (and therefore his situation)

is temporary. As long as he knows that, he can

hope. Our only hope of breaking Subject will

be to allow him to convince himself that he has

ot into a situation from which he can extricate

imself£ only by cooperating. This could be :
best achieved by breaking sharply with the

present situation, placing him in permanent

quarters, preferably remote and more primitive

than his present quarters, physically secure

and resembling jail, and capable of being manned -
by a minimum of guard personnel who would not

keep him under constant direct visual observa-

tion. No Headquarters case officer would visit

him, until he has given sign that he has changed 1
his mind. This period would last for several
months, pending another attempt to break him
based on information obtained in the interim.

Elaboration of the Plot Theory

The stringency of the rules governing treatment of :
Nosenko varied from time to time, but the general trend ‘
was to take an ever harder line towards him. Since it
was assumed that he was a KGB-dispatched agent, he could
only satisfy his interrogators by admitting that such
was the case. But, while he would from time to time at- :
tempt to placate his questioners with admissions of having
lied or incorrectly reported certain past events, he would
never admit to the key accusation of Being KGB-controlled.
The inevitable result was not only greater harshness
toward him but a gradually spreading suspicion in regard
to other agents, past and present, who seemed in any way
to support his bona fides. This development is mirrored
in a memorandum that the principal case officer wrote : 3
after a visit with Helms on 19 November 1964: H ,

In connection with Nosenko, Mr. Helms referred z
to it as one of the greatest time consumers

he had ever seen. I remarked that I felt the H
time was well spent since our examination of this ‘ Fi

, Because Nosenko refused to "break," however, it was
hard to adduce proof of Golitsyn's theory substantial
enough to convince Helms, the FBI, and other officials
and organizations not so deeply committed to the theory. :

(onthe
other hand, no one had at his Fingertips the vast array
of facts, and suppositions masquerading as facts, on
which the case was based. The theory was therefore
difficult to challenge; there may even have been reluctance
to do so, because the main proponents of the disinformation
theory frequently referred to unhappy consequences that
would flow from abandoning the course upon which the
Agency had embarked. Should the Agency change course,
for example, by simply returning Nosenko to Soviet hands,
terrible, though ill-defined, consequences would cer-
tainly ensue. As the principal case officer said (again
ied sf 20 November 1964 memorandum of conversation with
lelms) =

I pointed out the potential dangers of return-
ing Nosenko unscathed and within a short time.

I thought the KGB would be . . . concerned
{by implication, amazed and delighted] only
by the fact that a defector thrust into our
mits [sic] could expect such an easy fate
if uncovered.

Life in a Vault

The unforeseen stubbornness of Nosenko had meanwhile
brought SR Division to an impasse from which there was
but one escape--the more-or-less permanent incarceration
of Nosenko. Nothing that the latter said would be be-
lieved except the one admission that he steadfastly re-
fused to make {i.e., that he had been dispatched by the
KGB), and, although Helms wanted to solve the problem
thus created by simply turning Nosenko back to the Soviets,
this solution was resisted by the division. The upshot
was that, on 27 November 1964, Chief, SR wrote:

. . If he fails to convince us (which he
gan’ t) and refuses to confess what we already
know, the US government has every intention
of protecting itself against this dangerous
provocation by detaining him indefinitely.

As the new installation neared completion, Chief,
SR on 1S June 1965 wrote Helms:

We believe that we have gone just about as far
as normal interrogation techniques will take {
us, and that the time has come to prepare Sub-
ject for his move to the ostensibly permanent
detention site... It will be ready for j
occupancy on or about 1 August. Chief, SR/CI if
visited the site on 11 June and reports that i
the installation is excellent from every point ef
of view.

Before returning the memorandum, Helms penned a
marginal note next to the above paragraph: "I would 7
like both you and [Chief, CI] to examine this site." i

If Helms had had any doubt about the site's suitability, eee Paes
he must have been reassured by a 28 July 1965 memorandum
addressed to him by the Director of Security: i

i On Tuesday, 27 July, the Chief, CI Staff, the Goer

By mid-August, the time had come for Nosenko's transfer.
The events surrounding it are recounted in a 19 August 1965 dq ’
memorandum for the record:

on the same evening, immediately prior to his
removal to new quarters. The purpose of this
session was not to deliver a new message of

any sort, or to give Subject “another chance }
to confess"; everything that could be said had 7 t
already been said by . . . the previous inter- !
rogators, and there was no doubt that Subject
understood perfectly well the meaning and
importance of what had been said to him; also,
it was recognized that Subject would sense an '
impending move or change of some sort, and that

it was inevitable that he would hope that the

change would be for the better until he saw

otherwise. The purpose of the confrontation

was rather to close the circle: to show him

that although [the principal case officer} had

not seen him for over a year nothing had changed,

i and nothing would change until he told the

truth. An additional effect would be to empha-

size that the interrogators who had worked with

him in the interim were fully responsible and }
authoritative, and that just as Subject had been :
told when he was first locked up in April 1964,

what he was up against was the collapse of the

operation in which he was involved. Finally, |
[the principal case officer} would stress... i
that the "investigation is closed" and that }
Subject had only prolonged and tetal isolation ‘

to look forward to now unless and until he i
decides to confess.

It lasted for 15 minutes only (2100 to 2115)
and was essentially a formality, although it
is hoped that Subject will have reason to re-
flect on it in the months ahead. As can be
seen from the attached summary transcript,
Subject did not display any hesitancy or
indecision, and his answers and statements t i
were made in a mechanical manner.

At this point, we must pause to consider for the
moment how the period that follows is to be covered.
Because there were long periods of time when no human
being other than the guards was in contact with Nosenko,
and because he was not allowed to keep a diary, the
story of his sojourn from August 1965 to October, 1967
does not lend itself easily to narrative presentation.

Yet this period cannot be ignored. It constituted
over half of Nosenko's solitary confinement. And that
three-and-a-half-year period amounts to five percent of
the total life span of a man who lives to be 70.

Obviously, then, this period will weigh heavily
in the findings made at the conclusion of our study.
For these findings to be valid, they must be made on
the basis of as much empirical evidence as can be
gathered. Because the effect on Nosenko of this long

period of confinement can only be dealt with speculatively,

such few remarks as we have on that subject will be

We now resume our narrative.

On 13 August 1965, before Nosenko was locked into
his cell for the first time, he was read the following
instructions, which outlined the basic rules to be fol-
lowed from-then on:

Withifitthe framework of the above rules, which were
strictly enforced, Nosenko's only diversion was reading
the one book per weck that he was at first allowed. He
did not even have the distraction of being questioned,
for, when queried by Helms on 12 January 1966, Chief,
SR stated that no one from SR Division had seen Nosenko

since the beginning of his confinement there, five
months earlier. :

On 1 November 1965, his privileges began to be re-

On 1 March 1966, the principal case officer and
and SR/CI representative accompanied the two doctors
to another examination of Nosenko. One doctor conducted
the examination, while the other members of the party
observed it on a television screen. None of the four
men gave much credence to Nosenko'’s claim of hearing
voices, but the following was noted:

But, beyond this, it is difficult

to interpret the significance of his remarks
and behavior during [a second doctor's] inter-
view--on one hand there were indications of
deterioration; on the other Nosenko is an
astute actor, who was clearly playing a role
for [that doctor]. Bearing in mind that these
superficial indications may well be a part of
this act, Nosenko appeared far more subdued,
almost despondent, compared with six months
ago. For most of the interview, he slouched
or sat listlessly in his chair and only sel-
dom did he lean forward and, by the motions

of his hands, attempt to reach and to secure
the understanding and belief of the interviewer.
There appears to be a slight deterioration in
his English-language fluency (see transcript
below) and his replies were broken by frequent
pauses, incomplete sentences, and confusing
revisions.

Nosenko's changed outlook next took the form of two
letters to the principal case officer, written in mid-
April 1966 (although incorrectly dated, because by now
his calculation of the passage of time was no longer
anced accurate). The first, and briefer of the two,
read:

I ask you to excuse me for my baseness in 1962
and 1964. Now I have completely realized all
my ti and have reevaluated my past
“life.”

I want to live an exclusively honest and modest
life and I am ready to work in whatever place

that it may be possible, taking into account

my knowledge of Soviet Russia. I believe that
ads sufficient strength to live only a real
ife.

I ask you to help me.

The second letter was even more self-accusatory, and
was clearly modeled after the self-criticisms exacted
from prisoners in the Soviet Union. It began:

My despicable behaviour from the beginning of
my acquaintance with you in 1962 led to it

I should have honestly told you everything
it myself, about my moral principles and
ife in Soviet Russia in order to start
$ ynscientious life in June 1962.

This’ letter next summarized Nosenko's career from
childhood until his arrival in the United States, and %
admitted that although he had been documented "errone-
ously" as a lieutenant colonel he had actually never
held a military rank higher than captain in the KGB.
It concluded:

Work in the KGB was the chief and deciding
period of my degradation--drunkenness,
debauchery, baseness, and falsehood.

I should have told you all about this in
1962 or in 1964, before flying to America.

The Chief, SR commented:

The letters themselves do not represent a com-
plete break but they reveal that his defenses
are weakening and he may be seeking a way out.
He tells essentially the same story as before
but with more discrepancies of detail which
Suggest further deterioration and, by this
time, an inability to recount his legend
consistently, The most significant change

is that he now admits he was only a Captain

in the KGB and not a Lt. Colonel. On the other
hand, tbis_may_be a prearranged fall-back posi-

tion. /

On the other hand, there can be no doubt that
the rank of Lt. Col. was part of the KGB pre-
pared legend for Nosenko, and not simply his
own improvisation. This is proved by the fact
that one of the personal documents that Nosenko
brought with him to Geneva in 1964 was a TDY
travel order which Nosenko claims to have used
to travel to Gorkiy . . . {and] was clearly a
deliberate plant by the KGB and there can be no
question of its being filled out erroneously.
Furthermore, the rank was necessary to sustain
the fiction of Nosenko's high supervisory posi-
tions, which in turn were necessary to explain
his access to the information he claims to have.

Aside from the hope they offer for success in
breaking Nosenko, the most interesting aspect

of the letters is their tone. He does not com-
plain of our treatment of him but on the con-
trary expresses appreciation for it and says
that it was entirely justified. They are the
latest in a series of indications that Nosenko
is weakening. They follow an attempt to feign
insanity, an abortive hunger strike and some
erratic behaviour concerning his exercise period.

We plan to answer him along the lines that

we are willing to forgive his "baseness and
falsehood" and discuss his rehabilitation

but only when he is prepared to drop the legend
which he seems to maintain in his letter. If
he is, as we think, getting desperate to get
out, he may reply with further admissions.

(The reference to "special interrogation techniques"
harked back to a 13 January 1966 discussion with Helms,
during which the latter had stated that "he was inclined
to try special techniques on Subject in the hope that
they might somehow provide the answers we are seeking.”
In this context, "special techniques" was a euphemism for
the use of drugs as aids in interrogation. As will be
shown later, although Helms was willing to discuss the
use of such techniques in this case, he in fact never gave
his consent and they were never employed. Nevertheless,
the use of drugs for interrogation purposes seems to have
been contemplated for some time, since it is foreseen in
handwritten notes made by the principal case officer as
early as November 1964, and Chief, SR and the principal
case officer continued to press for permission to employ
them until a final negative decision by Helms on 1
September 1966.)

On 26 April 1966, Chief, SR again wrote Helms to
say that a response to Nosenko's letters had been delayed .
in order to allow time for discussion with Chief, CI and
the psychiatrist. Their combined judgment seems to have
been that the letters were "an attempt to relieve the
isolation by reestablishing personal contact, if only
with his interrogators." He bolstered this view by an
appeal to medical authority:

It is [the psychiatrist's] opinion, in which
we fully concur, that any such contact would
. in fact constitute a relief for Nosenko and
that it would be a serious mistake to grant

him this at the very moment that his
psychological defenses say be cracking.

On the contrary, {the psychiatrist] feels
we should cut off any hopes Nosenko may
harbor that he can alter his present situa-
tion without a full confession.

Since it is the technique of isolation and
rejection that has led to the recent promising
changes in Nosenko's attitude and behavior, we
believe that it is logical to continue along
the same linés and that there is a reasonable
expectation that this treatment will produce
further results in the near future. We
therefore intend to send Nosenko the attached
letter and to wait approximately 60 days before
changing our tactics.

The letter thereupon sent to Nosenko in the principal
case officer's name read as follows:

I have received your letters and so-called

“autobiography.” We understand fully what

degradation the Soviet system has forced you

into and as you have been told, we are willing

to help you establish a real life.

As I told you in August, however, we have no
further interest in reading or listening to
the legend (or its variations) that you con-
tinue to repeat. We are only interested in
idence that you really want to talk truth-
Fully. In the future we will reply only to a
true written account of your life and how your
legend was prepared. Do not waste our time -
with the lies of the past. This legend cannot :
be the basis of a new life for you. i

Chief, SR's next report, dated 11 May 1966, was the
following:

As previously agreed on 28 April, a brief note
was passed to Nosenko in response to his earlier
note and slightly amended biographical state-
ment. He made no response upon receiving our
note (although he did not touch his meal that
night); but on the evening of 4 May he asked

i for a pencil and paper, indicating, in reply

4 to a question from the guard, that he had a
statement to make in response to our note.
After writing his note, he sealed it in an
envelope and gave it to the guard to be
delivered.

‘ The note, written in English, states:

Allow me to thank you very much for your kind
letter. Now I understood fully what degrada-
tion to the Soviet Russia had forced me into.
At last I can tell you that I really want to

{The psychiatrist] concurs in our plan and
recommends that it be carried out as soon as
possible to achieve maximum effect. If we
get a positive response we will follow up
immediately.

In accordance with the above memorandum, the follow-
ing form was passed to Nosenko on 13 May 1966, apparently
by the Security guards:

Answer "YES" or "NO":

The next major maneuver on Nosenko's part was a
hunger strike, in the course of which he lost some forty
pounds. This tactic was counteracted with the help of a
medical officer while administering a physical check-up
on 22 June 1966: :

In the course of the examination, [this doctor]

questioned Subject on the reasons for his fast

and got him to admit that this was a deliberate

tactic. As planned, the doctor showed no

concern, assured Subject that he was still in

good health, described to him in some detail i:

the physical and mental consequences of prolonged

undernourishment, and emphasized that Subject
would not be allowed to do himself any damage

in this manner. The doctors' description of some

of the standard methods of forced feeding and his

matter-of-fact emphasis that all appropriate
medical measures could and would ve taken at
the present site made an instant and evident
impact on Subject,’ who nevertheless continued
to assert that he had no need or desire for
more food. (Despite the weight loss, the re-
sults of the medical exam showed that Subject
is in good overall condition.)

On 23 June, the day following the doctor's
visit, Subject began to eat ravenously and
he has been consuming all his meals since.
By 6 July he had gained 15 Ibs.

The Agency's next step was to have the principal
case officer see Nosenko. This interview, which took
place on 6 July 1966, lasted for about 45 minutes and
“was the first time that a case officer had talked to
Subject since he was moved . . ." The interview re-
sulted in another stand-off, the principal case officer
insisting that Nosenko admit to being a KGB agent and
the latter refusing. Once again, however, Agency offi-
cers in charge felt they were making progress:

{The psychiatrist], who monitored the entire
interview, was impressed by the fact that Subject
had used it solely to appeal to the pity and
sympathy of the interviewer, and felt that the
way in which the interview was conducted would
very effectively slam shut still another psycho-
logical door. It is believed that for the first
time Subject has come to appreciate the measure
of our resolve and determination, and that he is
actively grappling with the realities of his
present situation. Subject's pattern of behavior
over the past few months suggests that he will
need some time to fully digest the import of the
{principal case officer's] interview, but that

. he will then be impelled to initiate some new
effort to releive (sic) his lot. Very few
alternatives short of confession--real or false--
appear to be left to him.

On 23 August 1966 Helms, who had become DCI on 30
June 1966, instructed the DDP and Chief, SR to close the
case "within about sixty days assuming there are no new
developments which would warrant reconsideration of this
development.” Chief, SR gave this account of Helms'
reasoning:

SECRET

} . . . the Director advised us that in his

; view the time had come to consider disposal of :
: Subject. He was willing, he said, to proceed :

with the immediate plans we had for the sodium 1
amytal interview and to consider proposals for i
use of special techniques within the time frame i

we suggested but unless these steps developed

new information or indicated definite progress
in resolving the case, he wanted us to wind it
up. i

Helms' decision triggered a new rash of activity
within what was now the SB Division. Chief, SR, noting
that "there is no appeal . . . unless we uncover new, j
compelling data," reconstituted a special Task Force
to work on the case, headed by the principal case officer.

A problem which the principal case officer found |
particularly thorny, to judge by his notes, was posed by |
the FBI's unwillingness to accept CIA's evaluation of
Nosenko. ‘ T

Our case is based primarily on analysis, not
confirmed by juridically acceptable evidence,
and this analysis is so complex that it pro-
H bably could not be made more understandable

i to laymen than it has been to the FBI, which
: has largely failed to understand it.

Despite Helms‘ expressed preference for returning A
Nosenko to Soviet hands, the principal case officer con-
tinued to have misgivings about such a course:

Danger in the Nosenko case lies not only in
holding him, but in bringing his case to public
notice again, and especially in allowing the
Soviets to regain possession of him. (Our
denial of Nosenko to the Soviets, particularly
if they are in some doubt about his real
status/loyalty, is a form of guarantee that
the Soviets cannot take the many damaging
actions available to them if they had the
body.) The course of action therefore must
balance the respective dangers.

Helms, on the other hand, hardened his position. 7 1 4
: He was perhaps influenced by [the psychiatrist's] ¥
pointing out that in his experience with sodium :
amytal it had only worked once, and then by accident; :
Helms promptly revoked his permission for use of this :
drug. Helms remarked that Nosenko was “one person on 4
whom these techniques were never going to be used." :
The upshot was that, on 1 September 1966, Helms
limited the interrogators to the polygraph in any >
future interrogations, and reiterated his preference ° *
for “having Subject turned back to the Soviets..." 2

On 2 September, Chief, SB saw Helms again, to ask E é a
that under’ the new circumstances the sixty-day deadline
be extended. Helms agreed on an extension until the
end of the year. A discussion of a final report and
"disposal" then ensued, reported by Chief, SB as follows:

- « - it would be imprudent I thought not to
have ready for any eventuality a detailed
gtudy of our findings. This would provide
backup to our final report to the intelligence
community principals, the Secretary of State,
Attorney General and others. In the case of
the FBI, I added, we would most certainly
have to have such a document. [This remark
stemmed from the fact that the FBI had never
fully agreed with the Agency's views on
Nosenko.]

As for disposal, [Director Helms] believed
that return to Soviet control is the only :
practical solution. Third country disposal : :
might only delay our having to face the same - fat ;
problems and if accusations are leveled at
the agency it would be far preferable to
have Subject in Soviet hands. The Director
did not believe the Soviets would refuse to
accept Subject and felt we could take the
sting out of any Soviet reaction by our own
statement concerning Subject's mission. If
our position is publicized first, anything
the Soviets or anyone else says about the
case thereafter will have very little effect.

need to bring this case to an end in a manner H

to be stampeded by publicity beyond our
control.

Interrogation of Nosenko, preparatory to the
preparation of the above-mentioned final report, was
recommenced on 18 October 1966. Assisting in the in-
terrogation was the polygraph operator whose 1964
olygraph tapes were at this very time under review
y the Office of Security; on 1 November, thirteen
days later, they were officially and in writing
pronounced to have been invalid.

This is what Chief, SB had to report on 25 October
1966: i

Nosenko knows he is reacting in sensitive
areas and this is worrying him because he is
not sure how much we know or how we learned
it. Nosenko's reactions have given us hope
that we may be this procedure have begun to
strike home. We do not know what it is that
keeps this man sitting month after month in
his present situation. We speculate that one
factor may be confidence that the KGB will
get him out. Related to this may be the
thought that the KGB has CIA so deeply pene-
trated that it would be unhealthy for him

to confess. Our current line of interroga-
tion, expanded and used even more forcefully,
might break down some of his obstacles to
confession by showing us in a different and
Stronger posture.

Despite eight days of interrogation employing the

polygraph, however, SB Division did:not achieve their

oal: Nosenko did not "confess" to being a “provocateur.”

erating under the constraint of Helms’ injunction to
wind up the case by the end of the year, the principal
case officer made one last attempt to shatter Nosenko's
resolution. In a long letter, the principal case officer
outlined the hopelessness of Nosenko's situation and
adduced a number of proofs of Nosenko's prevarication,
derived in part from a fictitious "KGB officer . . . sent
out as a provocateur" whom the SB Division leadership
invented for purposes of this letter. A possible tactical
error on their part, however, was the inclusion of informa-
tion about Nosenko, ostensibly received from the notional

SECRET

-65-

source, which Nosenko himsélf would obviously recognize
as false: "He heard that''you had been in prison in the
USSR, and that you receivéd'a Government award for your
meetings with us in 1962:"~ According to the SB Division
officer who delivered the letter, Nosenko responded to
this allegation with a belly-laugh, but he certainly was
depressed, as his rambling remarks to the SB Division
emissary showed:

+ «+ « I know about my lies and I corrected all
my false statements, my chattering. I know
everything what is necessary for me to know.
And I will be here, I understand this, I will
be here so many years as you will ccensider it
necessary. You consider five . .. I will be
five; you consider ten . . . I will be ten.

I have no, I have no exit and I have no way
out of this situation, and. . .

Inter-Agency Disagreement

Meanwhile, enormous effort went into preparation
of SB Division's “final report" on the case. This docu-
ment, frequently referred to as the "thousand-page re-
port,” was described by Chief, SB as follows:

[It] will reflect all of AEFOXTROT's state-
ments concerning his personal life, alleged
KGB career and other matte>s as well as sub-
sequent contradictions or denials of earlier
statements plus the results of our investiga-
tions at home and abroad of these statements.

|

|
| ia |
This factual portion a

will be fol

lowed by analysis and conclusions.

The latter will be absolutely unequivocal on
these points:

a. AEFOXTROT is a dispatched
KGB agent whose contact with us and
ultimate defection were carried out
at KGB direction.

SECRET



‘

“A i
SECRET

-66-

b. AEFOXTROT's claim to service
in the KGB was an integral and vital
part of his KGB agent mission, forming
as it did the basis for all that he has
had to say about KGB operations and
personnel. Yet, the results of our
interrogations of AEFOXTROT supported
by polygraph examination demonstrate
conclusively that AEFOXTROT did not
and could not have served in any of the
specific staff positions he has described.

if c. Whatever the ultimate goals

of this KGB operation might be, it has

been possible to determine that among

the most significant KGB aims in

directing AEFOXTROT to us were: (1)

to persuade us of KGB ineptitude and

lack of success in developing technical

and human penetrations of the US

i government, its security and intelli-
gence services while at the same time

Preparation of the report was somewhat complicated
by disagreements between CIA and the FBI, as well as
between SB Division and CI Staff within the Agency. The
intra-CIA disagreement stemmed from differing views on
the validity of Golitsyn information. Whereas SB Division
insisted that Nosenko, during his KGB career, had never
“served in any of the specific staff positions he has
described," Golitsyn had in some respects supported
Nosenko's claims regarding his KGB service. After a con-
ference with Chief, CI, the Chief, SR summed up the
problem on 29 March:

Chief, CI said that he did not see how we could
subnit a Final Report to the Bureau if it con-

tained suggestions that Golitsyn had lied to us
about certain aspects of Nosenko's past. He

SECRET



ass Ronettes Bacay sae Wem soeS ——

*SEGR

-67-

recalled that the Director of the FBI had stated
that in his opinion Golitsyn himself was a provo-
cateur and penetration agent. On the other hand,
most FBI agents have accepted that when Golitsyn
was speaking on facts known to him he was accu-
rate even though they do not accept most of his
hypotheses or inferences drawn froa facts.

Chief, CI went on to say that if we submitted

to the FBI a report on Nosenko in the form we
now have it, it would most certainly cause us
difficulties. It might cause us to lose whatever
impact our report would be able to make on the
overall question of Nosenko's bona fides . . .

The disagreenents between the Agency and the FBI were
never to be resolved as long as Nosenko remained within
the jurisdiction of the SB Division and the CI Staff.
Within house, Chief, SR and Chief, CI eventually papered
over their differences sufficiently to publish a second,
compromise report on the Nosenko case in February 1968.
But by then the case had been taken out of their hands,

and the report was a dead letter even before it went to
press.

Voices of Dissent

Meanwhile, although the top leadership of SR Division
remained unassailably certain of its thesis regarding
Nosenko as a KGB-dispatched agent, there was some dissent
at the lower levels. Manifestations of disagreement were
not well received by the leadership, however, and thus
had no effect on the handling of the case. A former
member of SR/CI remembers that it was sometimes possible
to discuss alternative ways of presenting very specific
points in preparing the written case against Nosenko
(which was eventually to become the so-called “thousand-
page paper"), but no qualification of the basic thesis
was tolerated.

The first recorded dissent, therefore, came from
outside SR Division, and it was a tentative one. A
senior Plans Directorate psychologist had been asked to
interview Nosenko in depth, which he did during a series
of meetings between 3 and 21 May 1965. As a ‘result of
his questioning, he became convinced that at the very
least Nosenko was in fact Nosenko. Even this rather

bland assertion, however, was met by Chief, SR with
the statement, “there are things in this case that
you do not know about.” Nonecheless, in summing up
the sessions, the psychologist had this to say:

I am totally at a loss to even attempt to
Yationalize why a story with this much
pathology would be used as a legend. Nothing
could be served other than to discredit the
man to whom it was assigned. In some remote
sense--to me--it might have been felt it would
evoke sympathy but this is really far out and
a very dangerous gamble on their part. The
manner in which he has told his story and
the nuances he has introduced would require
great ingenuity and preparation. From my
standpoint, he has been essentially convincing
and accurate in general if not always truthful
in detail. Here I am talking about the psycho-
logical data only--I am not prepared to ex-
press an opinion on other aspects. Within
whatever frame of reference I can operate, I
am forced to conclude that all the psycholog-
ical evidence would indicate that he is Nosenko,
~ the son of Ivan Nosenko. His life story is
essentially as he has described it. It is
obviously distorted in places but in each case
there is a probable psychological reason for
the distortion and deception. No man is a 7
good reporter on himself and we all use
Fationalization to avoid seeing ourselves as
others see us. My opinion, for whatever it
is worth, is that Nosenko cannot be broken
outside the context of his life story and
personality structure. It shoyld be noted
here that the life story is completely com-
patible with the personality structure as
projected by psychological tests.

The psychologist claims now that he had more doubts
about the validity of the SR view of Nosenko than he
felt it wise to express. The following excerpt from a
memorandum of conversation, dated 4 August 1976, gives
his memory of the situation facing him:

In discussing his lengthy series of inter-

views with Nosenko on 3-21 May 1965, [the

psychologist] said that he was very hesitant

to express the full extent of his doubts
about the theory that Nosenko was a KGB-
dispatched agent. The reason for his hesi-
tation was that, when [Chief, SR] got a hint
of [the psychologist's] doubts about the
theory, [Chief, SR] told [the psychologist]
that such doubts might make [the psychologist]
suspect of himself being involved in the KGB/
Nosenko plan.

There is no evidence in the files to indicate that
the psychologist's doubts were accorded any impartial
consideration. Chief, SR, in a 15 June 1965 memorandum
to Helms (who was by then DDCI, but still riding herd
on the case), described the interviews as "“unrewarding
in terms of producing new information or insights ...
It was obvious that Subject had given some thought .. .
to improving and smoothing over some of the rougher
spots in his story."

By the end of 1965, there were others in SR Division
who doubted the thesis, and one of them was willing to
risk his career by putting his thoughts on paper in a
3l-page memorandum to Chief, SR commenting on a "sterile"
version of SR/CI's "notebook" documenting the case against
Nosenko. It began:

Introduction

At your request, I have read the basic Nosenko
notebook and I hope you will honor my right to
dissent. I find the evidence that Nosenko is a
bona fide defector far more convincing than the
evidence used in the notebook to condemn him as
a KGB agent. i:
It is because I am concerned about the serious
ramifications of a wrong verdict that I wish to
set forth my dissenting views in considerable
detail. I£ the present verdict of “guilty” is
right I believe there must be satisfactory
answers to the questions raised herein; if it is
wrong--as I believe it is--it should be
rectified as soon as possible.

Intelligence Production

book to the extent and quality of the intelligence

he provided. In the 25 March 1964 memo to
DDP, it is asserted that "A comparison of
his positive intelligence with that of other

Soviet Bloc intelligence officers)

l aE [shows
that all of them were consistently better able
to provide useful positive intelligence than
has been Nosenko." Tab D of this same memo
states “His positive intelligence production
is practically nil," and later: "Viewed
overall, however, Nosenko's positive intelli-
gence production has been so meager for a man
of his background, training and position as to
case doubts on his bona fides, without refer-
ence to other criteria.” AIl of these state-
ments are incorrect.

The three persons in the Clandestine Services
with the background and experience to make such
a judgment regarding Nosenko's production and
access agree that they are incorrect. No KGB
‘officer has been able to provide more useful
intelligence than Nosenko has; experience has
shown that intelligence usefulness of KGB
officers in general is "practically nil."
Golitsyn's was nil. Viewed in the proper con-
text, therefore, Nosenko's intelligence produc-
tion cannot be used in his defense, but neither
can it be said honestly to cast any doubt what-
soever on his bona fides. In the realm of sub-
stance, judgment regarding his bona fides must
therefore be made on the basis of his counter-
intelligence information.

Counterintelligence Production

The ultimate conclusions about Nosenko's bona
fides, as of March 1964 DDP memo and others
Indicate, must be based on his production--how
much did he hurt the Soviets. I believe that

the evidence shows that he has damaged the Soviet
intelligence effort more than all other KGB
defectors combined.

Chief, SR later wrote: =

N. Helms Takes Control

With the third anniversary of Nosenko's confinement ‘ .
drawing near, no resolution of the case was yet in sight.
The FBI continued to take what Chief, SB described as a
“neutral position" in regard to Nosenko.

The conflicting views of the various interested
parties are not sufficiently relevant to the purposes of |
this study to require a detailed coverage. What is
relevant is the fact that the stand-off increased Helms'
impatience with continued delay. He therefore initiated
a number of measures that gradually took handling of the
entire Nosenko matter out of the hands of the SB Division.
The first of these measures Was to instruct the DDCI to
undertake a thorough study of the Nosenko case.

When debriefed regarding the Nosenko case on 21

September 1976, the former DDCI remembered his ‘nvolvement
as follows:

DDCI: I became concerned as a result of Dick Helms
[saying] that there was a matter that worried
him very deeply, that needed resolution, that he
doubted that there was enough objectivity amongst
the people in the Agency who handled it so far
to arrive at any kind of a really objective
solution to the problem, and it was very sensitive
indeed, would I please look into it and let him

know my conclusions. Then he went on to tell me

i about Nosenko, the defector, who was at that

time incarcerated . . . And he mentioned that

: there was a dichotomy of views in the DDP as to

i whether Nosenko was a bona fide defector or whether

: he had been sent on a miss’ > and that in any

| case he, Helms, felt that it*was wrong to keep

him confined and we had to do something with him
one way or the other.

Lie eateeteninin nederland ers

tance agian

Q: He said that it was wrong to keep him confined?

DDCI: Yes, he was really distressed about the fact that :
this fellow had been in confinement so long and
: that they had never been able to arrive at a con-
clusion as to whether he was a bona fide or whether
: he was a oe and he just had to get it resolved
and something had to be done to get this fellow

but in a more acceptable position. So, I

said, yes, I would undertake this job an: I
sent for all the background papers on it and
studied them first. Then I interviewed [Chief,
CI and Chief, SB] and arrived at the conclu-
sion . . . I think I talked to some other
people in the Soviet Division of the DDP also,
but I arrived at the conclusion that people

had their feet so mired in concrete of opinion
as to one side or the other of the case, that
it was just damned near impossible to get any
worthwhile information out of interviews. And
I then wrote a memorandum to Helms in which I
indicated that 1 had, after reviewing the...
making a preliminary review of the case, that

I had considerable doubt that Nosenko was a
plant; if so, I couldn't figure out what he was
planted for. Nor could I get out of anybody
else what he was supposed . . . what his mission
was supposed to be, even in their hypothesis . . .

-_. . My second memorandum to Helms was to the
effect that, whatever the case, I didn't believe
that Nosenko was any threat whatsoever to the
Agency, that he ought to be rehabilitated, and

I got a free hand from Helms to go ahead with

the idea of rehabilitating him. And [the Director
of Security] then had him moved . ..

Well, do you remember anything about Dick Helms’
reactions to your recommendations? _ if
He seemed rather pleased with the information.

I go@ the impression from discussing the case
with him that he never had been able to get what
he felt was a really fair appraisal of it from
anybody; and I got the impression that he felt
at last he had a fair appraisal of it.

On 26 May 1967, the DDCI called the Director of
ity to his office, and the Director of Security re-
d the meeting as follows:

{The DDCI] started by asking me whether or not

I had seen the eight hundred page report summarizing
the Soviet Bloc Division's interrogation and ex-
ploitation of [Nosenko]. I said that I had not

read it personally but that [a member] of my
Security Research Staff was now in the process
of reviewing it and commenting on selected por-
tions of it. He then asked if I agreed with
its conclusions. I told him that I did not;
that it had been the consistent position of
this Office that while we did not, under any
circumstances, consider him bona fide, we were
not convinced that he was a provocation dis-
patched by the KGB with a specific mission.
Rather, our position has always been that there
is something wrong with [Nosenko] and his story
but we do not know enough in order to make a
final- decision.

I went on to point out to the [DDCI] that I

had thought, and had so recommended on numerous
occdsions in the past, that it would make a lot
of sense for [a member} of my Office to take

over the interrogation of [Nosenko] in order

to resolve several discrepancies that had always
concerned us. Further, I said that the polygraph
examination given {Nosenko] at the outset was
designed only to "break him" and was not an ob-
jective polygraph examination designed to establish
or deny his bona fides. I indicated that the
Director had approved this idea but that I had
been unable to sell the idea to . . . SB Division.

{The DDCI] said that he thought this was an
excellent idea. He agreed with me that we had
everything to. gain and nothing to lose through
such a course of action and that he would so
recommend to the Director. I pointed out to
him that one of the things that had always con-
cerned us was that the Soviet Bloc Division had
never released any verbatim transcripts covering
their many interrogations of [Nosenko] and that
we could make our judgment only on the basis of
written summaries prepared by the Division.

Thus, acting under the DDCI's orders, the Office of !

Security transferred Nosenko to "a decent, respectable
safehouse." SB Division was cut out of the case, as was
the CI Staff. E .

OQ. Resolution of the Case a

The Office of Security took over the handling of
Nosenko in October 1967. The officer in charge immedi-
ately inaugurated a rapid transition to normal livin
conditions. Throughout this process, he found Nosenko
fully cooperative, and without any tendency toward
drunkenness or other aberrant behavior.

The following is a summary report prepared on 16
November 1967:

Nosenko was moved to his current location on
27 October 1967 and the first interview with
Nosenko occurred on 30 October. During the
} first interview, particularly the first hour,
: Nosenko was quite nervous and showed a certain
reticence to talk. This condition ameliorated
i . rapidly and it is considered that the current
i situation is better than could have ever been
anticipated in view of the conditions of his
previous confinement.

Nosenko on his first day indicated his complete
willingness to answer all questions and to write
his answers to questions on areas of specific
interest. It was determined that his English

is adequate both for interview and for prepara-
tion of written material. Interviews are not
usually over two and a half hours a day, six i
days a week, with Nosenko preparing from six to
ten pages of written material each day. Pre- i i
pared material has included life history, in-
dividual cases, trips of Nosenko, reason for
defection, and detailed drawings of pertinent
offices during his claimed period of KGB employ-
ment.

There does ‘not appear to be any impairment of
his memory. His current living conditions, i
although physically secure, are luxurious com- i
pared to those he had been in during the past :
three years and have resulted in a relaxation
of physical tension.

a Definitive resolution of the complex problems in
this case will require a considerable period of

time for further interviews, preparation of
written material and a comparative analysis
against his previous statements and information
from other sources, interviews and investigation.
Nosenko freely admits certain previous lies con-
cerning a recall telegram while in Geneva and
having received certain awards or decorations.

All interviews with Nosenko are recorded and
transcripts of the interviews are being prepared.
In addition, all written material from Nosenko
is being typed with certain explanatory re-
marks . . . In addition, the Deputy Director of
Central Intelligence has been orally briefed

by the Director of Security. As of the

present time, it is estimated that there are
1,000 pages of material completed or awaiting
completion. All of the finished material is

in a form which will pevmit dissemination to

the FBI in part or in toto when such dissemina-
tion is considered appropriate.

Work thus far with Nosenko has resulted in a
clarification of certain areas of previous
controversy. As an example, it is considered
that.there can be at this time little doubt
that Nosenko was in the KGB during the approxi-
mate period which he claims to have been in
the KGB. The matter of the actual positions
held by Nosenko during the approximate 1953-
early 1964 period is not considered adequately
resolved at this time and any speculation con-
cerning the dispatched agent aspects would be
completely premature.

If even a degree of optimism if realistic, it
is felt that the additional interviews and work
in the Nosenko case together with a detailed
comparative analysis of all information will
provide a firmer basis for a final conclusion
of the Nosenko problem. Nosenko has been very
responsive [to] the normal consideration he is
now receiving, e.g., our current work with him,
and if it accomplishes nothing else, will at
least condition Nosenko more favorably for what-
ever future action is taken relative to his dis-
position. |

This questioning of Nosenko was paralleled by a
separate investigation conduc‘ed by the FBI. Results
were covered in two reports published at about the
same time, the FBI's on 20 September 1968 and the CIA
Office of Security's on 1 October 1968.

The essence of the Office of Security's findings
was expressed in a covering memorandum to the Directc..
of Security:

In brief, the conclusion of this summary is
that Nosenko is the person he claims to be,
that he held his claimed positions in the KGB
during 1953-January 1964, that Nosenko was
not dispatched by the KGB, and that his pre-
vious lies and exaggerations are not actually
of material significance at this time.

The conclusions of the FBI report were more sweep-
ing:

2. The current interrogations and collateral
inquiries have established a number of significant
omissions and inaccuracies in the February 1968
CIA paper and have invalidated the vast majority
of conclusions on which that paper relied to
discredit Nosenko.

2. The current interrogations and the poly-
graph examination* disclosed no indication of
leception on the part of Nosenko. He is know-
ledgeable in the areas and to the extent he
should be; he furnished logical explanations
for acquisition of information which would not
normally have been accessible to him in his
claimed positions. There is no substantial
basis for doubting his bona fides as a defector.

3. The variety and volume of information
provided by Nosenko is such that it is considered
impossible that he acquired the information
only by KGB briefing. It is also illogical and

*Reference is being made by the FBI to the polygraph examina-
tion of Nosenko performed by CIA between 2 and 6 August
1968 as part of the interrogation undertaken by the Office
of Security.

implausible that the KGB would have dis-
patched an officer of his caliber with in- i
structions to disclose the variety and volume F :
of valuable information furnished by him. No
compensatory objective is apparent.

4. The current interrogations show that t
Nosenko is in possession of information not
previously obtained. In the interest of both
intelligence and counterintelligence agencies
of the government, interviews should be con-
tinued to exhaust his knowledge. '

tion of all information and cases emanating from
Nosenko and other defectors where the decision
for action, or lack of action, was previously
influenced by the presumption that Nosenko was

a not a bona fide defector.

5. There should be a thorough re-examina- : ‘|

Despite the above findings, the CI Staff never gave 1
up its contention that Nosenko was a KGB-dispatched agent. i
On 31 January 1969, the CI Staff argued that to accept {
Nosenko's bona fides meant repudiating Golitsyn, “the
only proven reliable source about the KGB for a period of ie
time which appears to be vital to both Nosenko and CIA." 7

An undated memorandum written by the Office of i
Security officer in charge of Nosenko essentially brings
this chronicle to a close:

Since April 1969, Nosenko has had his own private e
residence and since June 1969, his own automobile.
Even prior to April 1969, Nosenko could have, if 4
he chose to do so, acted in a way seriously
adverse to the best interests 6f this Agency
since control was not of such a nature as to
preclude independent action by Nosenko.

activity which would “hurt the KGB." Nosenko
considers that he has certain capabilities

and knowledge which could be useful in the
effort of the United States government against
the KGB. This interest has not been associated
with any particular curiosity in regard to the
activities of this Agency .. .

Nosenko has consistently expressed his deep
interest in obtaining United States citizen-
ship as soon as possible. He realizes that
under normal circumstances, citizenship could
not be obtained until February 1974, but also
is aware that citizenship can be obtained in
less than the normal waiting period by legisla-
tive action.

Nosénko is considered by Agency personnel and
FBI personnel in contact with Nosenko to have
made an unusual adaptation to American life.
He lives like a normal American and has an
obvious pride in his home and personal effects.
His home life from all appearances is quite
calm. The fluency of Nosenko in the English
language has greatly increased and there is

no difficulty in understanding Nosenko or in
his ability to express his thoughts. Obviously
his accent and occasional incorrect sentence
structure (and misspelling of words) has not
been eliminated and probably will never be
entirely eliminated.

Nosenko continues to complete work assignments
expeditiously and with fnterest. As indicated
above, Nosenko is very interested in doing
“something active" which. is understandable.
Full consideration should be given to this
interest since if properly controlled and
channeled, could be used in a way adverse to
the best interest of the KGB.

Nosenko has since become a United Stated citizen,

has married an American woman, continues to lead a normal
life, and works productively for the CIA.

CHAPTER IV

Nosenko's Contribution: A Summary Evaluation

Any attempt to assess Nosenko's value to the US govern-
ment must begin by pointing out that he might well have been
able to contribute more had he been permitted to do so.
Unfortunately, we were unwilling to give serious considera-
tion to his stated desire to assist us in making recruitments
of Soviet officials; we discounted Nosenko's suggestions

. along this line as possibly part of 2 plan to embarrass the

US government. There is no telling what potential recruit-
ment targets might have emerged had we, soon after Nosenko's
defection, briefed him with such targets in view,

In this part of our study, we therefore confine our-
selves to a Summary of the contributions that, despite con-
siderable odds, Nosenko was able to make. Let us take them,
very briefly, oue by one.

A. Information on KGB Personnel

The Office of Security's 1968 report summed up
Nosenko's contribution in this field as follows:

Nosenko has furnished information concerning
perhaps 2,000 KGB officers and 300 KGB agents
Or operative contacts (here the terms agents
or operative contacts are used to refer to
Soviet nationals), mainly in the Second Chief
Directorate or internal KGB organizations,
However, he has identified approximately 250
former or current First Chief Directorate
officers and there is a considérable exchange
of officers between the FCD and SCD. In
addition, numerous officers of the SCD and
other internal KGB organizations travel abroad
with delegations, tourist groups, and as
visitors to various major exhibitions such

as World's Fairs. It is impossible at this
time to estimate the number of KGB officers
identified by Nosenko who have been outside
the Soviet Bloc since his defection or who
will be out some time in the future.

KGB Recruitment Efforts Against US Citizens

Most of Nosenko's own operational experience with
the KGB involved efforts against US citizens, either
visitors to the USSR or members of the US embassy in
Moscow. As a result of this background, Nosenko was
able to provide some 238 identifications of, or leads
to, Americans in whom the KGB had displayed some interest.

Some of the KGB operational efforts culminated in
“recruitments" that, according to Nosenko, were more

statistical than real; the KGB played the nunbers game,
for purposes of year-end reporting. Nonetheless,

Nosenko's reporting did result in the uncovering of
certain US citizens genuinely working for Soviet intel-
ligence:

1. US Army Sergeant Robert L. Johnson,
who had been recruited in 1953, was arrested
in 1965 on the basis of a Nosenko lead to an
agent assigned to a US military installation
outside Paris who was providing the KGB with
important documents as of 1962-1963. Johnson
was custodian of classified documents at Orly
Field Armed Forces Courier Transfer Station
during this period, and he provided documents
from there. Excerpts from a preliminary
damage assessment are included below:

The full extent of damage will only

be known when the current review of
documents by all affected agencies

is completed. The damage assessments
prepared by the military services, how-
ever, based on a review of their docu-
ments to date, indicate that as a re-
sult of access to documents in the Orly
vault, the Soviets may have learned:

From these preliminary reports . .. it is

most serious damage to US national security.

repairman” who confessed to hayihg been recruited
by the KGB while serving in Moscow during the period
1952-1954. Smith, while initially denying any con-
tact with Soviets, finally admitted he had been
recruited and had passed information to them.

of the US Armed Forces, later in the real estate
business as a civilian. In connection with
Nosenko's lead to Johnson, Mintkenbaugh was inter-
viewed after Mrs. Johnson identified him as a
friend of her husband's, Mintkenbaugh unexpectedly
volunteered that he, too, had been recruited, by
Johnson himself, to provide cover for and assist

the latter in his work on behalf of the KC%3.
Mintkenbaugh described his KGB role as a
spotter, collaborator with Johnson in
clandestine photography of documents, and
later as a courier between Johnson and his
KGB handlers.

Moscow Microphones

In 1962, Golitsyn had in general terms reported on
the existence of microphones in the US embassy in Moscow.
This information was promptly sent to the Department of
State, but no action was taken; lack of specificity was
cited as one of the reasons. It was not until Nosenko's
more detailed information was communicated to the Depart-
ment of State in March and June 1964 that action was
taken that led to th: uncovering of a system of $2 micro-
phones, beginning in April of that year. Of the micro-
phones found, 42 were active at the time of discovery.
These- microphones covered most of the offices in the
embassy most significant from the Soviet standpoint.

William John Christopher Vassall

Nosenko, in June 1962, told us the KGB had an agent
in the British Admiralty. Though this information
eventually contributed to the arrest and conviction of
William John Christopher Vassall, CIA for some time
tended to give Golitsyn credit for this success.

The British counterintelligence service stated in
1976 that, although Vassall probably would "eventually"
have emerged as a "leading candidate" for suspicion as
a result of the Golitsyn information, it was in fact
Nosenko's information that “was to clinch the identifica-
tion of Vassall as the spy."

The British added that "(Nosenko's] information
affecting UK interests seems to have been consistent with
his position and we cannot recall any indication in the
leads of UK interest that [Nosenko's] object might have
been to mislead or deceive."

Leads to Foreign Nationals

Altogether, Nosenko is estimated to have provided
some 200 identifications of, or leads to, foreign
nationals (including recruited agents) in some 36
countries in whom the KGB had an active interest.

F. Summary Evaluation

It is not feasible, within the terms of this study,
to make comparisons between Nosenko's counterintelli-
gence production and that of other similarly qualified
defectors.: Enough has been said, however, to demonstrate
on an absolute basis that, both in terms of quantity and
quality of information, Nosenko'’s contribution was of
great value to the US government.

The Analytical Foundations of the "Monster Plot" | A

duplicate the mammoth effort put into analyzing and validating
Nosenko's information by the Office of Security in CIA and

by the FBI; we have reviewed their work and can find no pos- zee
sible reason to challenge their findings. There remains, i" |
however, the question of how senior officials could have drawn Hl
so many erroneous conclusions from data tendered by a source :
whom we now believe to have been cooperative and acting in
good faith. -

A. Lack of Systematic Interrogation

At no time between June 1962 and October 1967 was i
Nosenko afforded the kind of systematic, objective, non-
hostile interrogation by well-informed professional in- |
telligence officers which had otherwise been standard

operating procedures in dealing with defectors |_

We now examine the manifestations and consequences:
of this problem at various stages of the case.

1. June 1962 Meetings

The transcripts of the 1962 meetings reveal a
disastrous problem of communication: 7

--Nosenko spoke fair English, but he preferred to
use Russian for the sake of precision. He spoke
Russian very rapidly, and his voice ranged from
loud and dramatic to excited whispering.

ea : J

The second meeting, the longest of the five,
was further disorganized by the fact that Nosenko
arrived half-drunk from partying the previous day
and most of the night. Even during the nearly eight-
hour interview, Nosenko continued to drink. is
point was consistently overlooked or ignored in later
examination of boastful claims Nosenko made during
this meeting; e.g., Nosenko personally handled the 7
Langelle/Popov case, Nosenko personally ran the
operation against a US security officer, Nosenko
personally talked to a US code clerk to try to re-
cruit him, etc. When confronted in hostile interroga-
tions in 1964 and 1965 with these claims, he denied
personal participation in all three instances (other
than directing the code clerk case behind the scene)
and said that if he had said such things in 1962 it
was because he was either drunk or under very strong
tension at the time. Such explanations were not con-
sidered acceptable by his interrogators, and the
claims were let stand as evidence of his mendacity.

While Nosenko provided a substantial amount
of information during these five meetings, there
was little or no follow-up questioning on most of it,
partly because of lack of time but also because of
the case officers’ lack of background on the KGB in

a and the Second Chief Directorate in particular.

2. January-March 1964

The second series of meetings in Geneva, in
January and February 1964, were sonewhat better
organized, but--given the already prevailing belief
that Nosenko was a KGB controlied agent--he was not
carefully questioned on the information he gave.
This was partly because it was considered of
primary importance not to reveal even by implica-
tion how much we already knew, lest his mission
include elicitation of information CIA had received
from Golitsyn or other sources considered bona fide.

Debriefings in the United States after Nosenko's
defection were similarly limited to noncontroversial
generalities and were not noteworthy for attention to

accuracy and detail. |

L

- 3. April 1964-October 1966

The hostile confrontation that took place for
some two weeks in April 1964 cannot be considered
systematic interrogation; "shouting matches" would
better characterize these sessions.

During one period--May to November 1964--Nosenko
was systematically debriefed in neutral fashion to
obtain additional information on leads to Americans
and other Westerners recruited by the KGB, in part to
meet requirements provided by the FBI. The other
two objectives of this debriefing period, of greater
importance to the CIA concerns in this case, were:

--to obtain answers to questions posed in writing
by Golitsyn, whose aim was to trap Nosenko into
5 : exposing his ignorance or “lies” about ‘topics
i Golitsyn considered central to Nosenko'’s "KGB
missions.”

--to acquire fuller background on Nosenko's
alleged duties and activities in his various
KGB positions in order to use his own informa-
tion against him in the hostile interrogation
period that was to follow.

The January-March 1965 hostile interrogations
were carefully structured and systematic but were
not designed to collect information. The information

Nosenko provided in these sessions was consistently

and intentionally ignored, as the stated objectives
were to force Nosenko to agree with his interrogators
that (1) he did not know what he should have known
(according to CIA assumptions), and (2) that he had
not held the positions in the KGB that he claimed.
This objective was "successfully" achieved in the
eyes of the interrogators by bringing Nosenko to
sign statements that purported to summarize his
statements of inadequacy of both knowledge and
eeicotrunae in regard to each of the positions he

ad held, Each time, in signing these so-called
"protocols," Nosenko objected that the way they

were worded distorted what he had said; however,

he acknowledged his inability to get his interroga-
tor to listen to what he was trying to tell him and
therefore his inability to reword these papers in
any manner satisfactory to him. When given one key
“protocol" to sign--one that was a "confession"

that he nad been sent by the KGB to deceive CIA,
and that he had lied purposely on behalf of the
KGB--he said that, if his signing this document
would serve some good purpose of CIA or of the US
overnment in general, he would do so, but only with
is interrogators’ clear understanding that the
entire "confession" was untrue. , Under these circum-
stances, his interrogators declined to have him sign
this document. Thus this series of interrogations
failed in its ultimate objective--that of "breaking"
Nosenko. ae

Subsequent interrogation sessions were not con-

structed to collect information any more than the
previous ones but were designed to collect further
damaging evidence of Nosenko's ignorance about the
KGB and of the areas in his reporting to which he
was “most sensitive" and that therefore were most
revealing of his “true KGB missions.” In sum, while
@ greal deal of personnel time was spent in talking

to Nosenko and a large amount of paper was
generated in consequence, the canons of proper
nterrogation were rarely observed.

4, Time Devoted to Debriefing or Interrogation

A point that can easily be overlooked is that,
of the total period of Nosenko's incarceration, a
relatively modest amount of time was devoted to
; actually debriefing or interrogating him. The most
{ generous estimate we can make is that approximately
Hl 292 days were at least in part devoted to debriefing
or interrogating Nosenko, out of a total of 1,277
i days' incarceration. Thus, from the standpoint of
i obtaining information, about 77 percent, or more
H than three-quarters, of the detention period was
' downtime.

B. Faulty Record of Conversations with Nosenko

The outcome of the Nosenko case was prejudiced at
the outset by the establishment of a faulty record.

eeeneteer SSIS 4

If anything, the role of the second case officer,
who had a native command of Russian but little patience_
wi il. simply compounded the errors. 4

The so-called "transcripts of the tapes" from the
five meetings were then prepared by the second case of- _
ficer between the week of 19 June and mid-August 1962.
Contrary to the usual procedure, the second case officer
did not first transcribe from the tapes into the combination

In March 1964 a KGB defector of 1954 vintage was
brought into the case to examine Nosenko's reporting
in terms of his own expertise on personalities, file
procedures, reorganizations, etc. He concentrated on
the early years of Nosenko's career, particularly 1952
and 1953. In a resultant memorandum dated 12 March 1964,
he commented as follows:

The undersigned began work on this special project
by reviewing the taped recordings of the meetings
only, without reference to the meeting transcripts,
believing that it would be possible and preferable
to get all the necessary information and other
material firsthand in this way. From the begin-
hing, however, it was obvious that this would be

i . very difficult, if not in many cases impossible;
the early tapes (Nos. 1-6 and especially No. 1)
were very poor in quality. (These are the tapes
for meetings No. 1 and 2.)

1

H After proceeding thus far in a review of the
tapes, the undersigned then switched over and
began anew, reviewing the transcripts alone and
without reference to the tapes. This method
also quickly proved unsatisfactory; from his
memory of the discussions as actually presented
on the early tapes, although poorly reproduced
and hard to "catch," the undersigned soon was
able to tell that the transcripts are, to say
the least, faulty.

A point-by-point review of the tapes and tran-
scripts was then initiated and has been pursued
until the present time by the undersigned. In
the course of this review, a large number of
errors--omissions and other discrepancies--
have been discovered scattered throughout the

f transcript coverage of the meetings recorded on
the tapes.

It is impossible to make enduring pronounce-
ments of the following type without knowing the
whole situation and being fully aware of all
the motives and factors--personal and profes-
sional--involved, yet it should be noted that
the undersigned in many places throughout the
records of the meetings has encountered exanples
of what he would consider errors in the handling
and conduct of those meetings. Let it suffice
merely to register this point here; notes on
this subject will be drafted and presented in
later papers.

He then proceeded to cite nine major examples of

errors, omissions, distortions, and procedures characteristic
of the second case officer's transcripts (and performance
during the meetings). He concluded by saying:

The foregoing present but a few examples of

errors, discrepancies, distortions, etc., to
be found throughout the transcripts. A com-
plete report of all such errors, ete., will

be prepared upon request.

The “complete report” was never prepared, and it may
never have been requested.

retranscribed exactly what Nosenko had said on the two
different occasions in 1962 when he had referred to
this case. The retranscription clearly verified
Nosenko's detail. Nonetheless, all subsequent papers
on the Nosenko bona fides question included reference
to his having claimed in 1962 that
in person. His denial of such a statement in all sessions
from 1964 onward was lost from sight.

Later in 1965, retranscription of the 1962 tapes
was begun, faithfully transcribing Russian when Russian
was used, and English when English was spoken. These
transcripts were not translated into full English,
however, until mid-1968 under the auspices of the Office
of Security reexamination of the entire Nosenko case.
In late 1968-early 1969, a line-by-line commentary
on the more significant discrepancies between the two
versions was prepared. It required some 35 pages to
cover only the major errors and the effects they had
had in supporting the charge that Nosenko was a false
defector who "lied" and "changed stories."

| [At this time,
however, Nosenko was restless, tense, and impatient
with the tedious interviews with which CIA was trying : ie
to keep him occupied. It appears obvious that he paid i
scant attention to the dates or terminology used in if
this draft, because he made only one noticeable change:
he insisted on deletion of a statement attributed to him
to the effect that he had attended a one-year course in
: counterintelligence at the beginning of his KGB career ‘
7 (a mistake dating from the 1962 "transcripts" by the ,
second case officer). Given the volume of other
erroneous statements in this “biography” that he left
untouched, one can only assume that he considered this
biography an exercise of no particular importance.

riecbaaetinn andas ibd

When hostile interrogations began on 6 April 1964,
the inaccurate biography was used as the base point for
measuring so-called “lies" about Nosenko's entire life
story. It therefore caused him to be accused time and
7 again of "changing his stories.”

interrogations concerned his responses to questions on
his schooling. Among other aspects of this subject,
Nosenko told his interrogators that he had spent approxi- 7 i

preparatory schools--(rough equivalent of American high ‘

The second case officer “transcribed” the tape of : i

thus (underlining is ours):

ended. The only time I participated in war-

time activities was when heavy combat was going eatstacs
on near Novorossiysk. They threw the students :
from Baku into the battle. i

After we lost Novorossiysk the remnants which
were somewhere between one third and one half
of the students were brought back to Baku. When
the war ended I had not yet graduated from Frunze
and I was demobilized. idn't want a military
career so I went to the Institute of Foreign
Relations in 1945 and graduated’ in 1949. Toward
the end of the year in early 1950’ the placement

missing in original transcript] where I wanted
to work. I said that I've had some military
experience and I'd rather have something along
that line rather than go to MID [Ministry of
Foreign Affairs]. They said I would be called
on the phone and they would let me know. I was
Peat up by the personnel section of the old
GB.

To Nosenko's interrogators in April, "Frunze” meant
only one thing--the Frunze Naval Academy, equivalent to
the US Naval Academy at Annapolis. Unfortunately, the :
naval preparatory school to which Nosenko referred was
named Fronze ‘also; it was the prep school for those Soviet
boys with aspirations for naval command positions who
would later go on to the Frunze Naval Academy. \
When Nosenko was asked in April 1964 to discuss his
schooling, he referred to having entered a naval preparatory
school--at roughly the high school level, and in Russian
called a uchilishche. This was, sajd he, the Leningrad
Naval Preparatory School named after Frunze*. In 1942,
the school was relocated to Baku because of the fighting
around Leningrad. Nosenko's interrogators clearly did not
understand what he was talking about, as they had no back-
ground on these naval preparatory schools; the only Frunze
they knew of was the Academy, and every time Nosenko men-
tioned the prep school carrying Frunze's name confusion

#In the Russian. language, the fact that a school-is named

after a great man is always made explicit. Thus, in Russian,
the George Washington University would be called the "University
named after George Washington."

erupted, At the end of several heated exchanges on this
topic, with the interlocutors invariably at cross pur-
poses, the conclusion was reached that Nosenko had lied
in saying originally that he had attended the Frunze
Naval Academy. The claim was then made that he had been
made to admit that he had not done so. He then was ac-
cused of telling stories, which were confused and contra-
dictory, about the secondary schools he claimed to have
attended,

Asked repeatedly if he was then saying that he did
not attend the Frunze Academy, he consistently replied
no, it was the Frunze preparatory school. This discussion
was repeated several times during these interrogations,
without the problem area's being resolved in the minds
of the interrogators.

Because of the lack of background on the part of
the interrogators, a memorandum for the record, dated 1
April 1964, Subject: "Interrogation of Yuriy I, Nosenko,
4-11 April 1964," contained the following relevant quota-
tions (underlining is ours):

. « + On 10 April, Subject was interrogated in
the morning and afternoon for a total of nearly
five hours. Questioning covered his early
schooling, his studies at the Institute [of
Internationa] Relations], and his service in
the naval GRU, both in the Far East and in the
Baltic. Gaps and contradictions in his accounts
cast doubt on whether he was telling the truth
about the early years of his life and even
Taised some possibility that we may not be
dealing with the real Nosenko . . .

. . . Under pressure, Subject admitted that he
had not entered the Frunze Higher Naval School

(Vysshaya Voyenno-Morskaya Shkola imeni Frunze)
in 154s bur that fhe had merely attended the

Leningrad Naval Preparatory School (Leningrad-
gkoye Voyenno-Morskoye Podgotovitelnoye
fchilishche) of the Frunze Higher Naval School.
His story now is that he attended the Moscow
Naval Special School (Moskovskaya Spetsialnaya
V.M. Shkola) in Kuybyshev from T 541 to 1942,
then entered the Leningrad Naval Preparatory

School in Baku, completing two classes of this
school in Baku (1942-1943 and 1943-1944), and

the third class in Leningrad (1944-1945).
Subject insists that he was given credit for
successfully completing each of the four years
of secondary schooling, but says that at the
end he had the equivalent of 10 years' educa-
tion. He can offer no explanation for the
discrepancy--by his chronology he would have
completed 11 years of schooling plus one year
of kindergarten. Subject has been very weak
in providing names of teachers and classmates
and descriptions of school layouts and curric-
ulum for this period, particularly for the
period in Baku. It is interesting that
{Nikolay Artamonov*}, who has identified pictures
of Subject as being identical with the son-of-a-
minister Nosenko whom he knew at the Leningrad
Naval Prep School in Leningrad in the period
1944-1946, has provided information about the
history and make-up of this school which is
incompatible** with Subject's story, as is
{Artamonov's]} statement that Nosenko was a
Class junior to [Artamonov} and would not have
graduated from the prep school until 1946.
Subject has never mentioned [Artamonov], and
has not yet been challenged on this part of his
story.

Further compounding the confusion on this one subject
was the development of suspicion that Artamonov, cited in
the memorandum above, was himself not bona fide. This
doubt arose because Artamonov claimed to have Known the
Nosenko in question, and, as shown in the paragraph cited
below from a 21 April 1964 summary of interrogations for
the second week, because his "own elementary and secondary
schooling is a curious parallel to Nosenko's ..."”
(underlining is ours). The followifig is quoted as an
excellent example of the reasoning process by which one
could at one and the same time be suspicions of Artamonov's
bona fides because some of his information supported what
Nosenko said, while also citing his reporting as evidence

*Nikolay Artamonov is a Soviet naval officer who defected in
1 :

**This is not a true statement. Artamonov's statements are
more confusing than clarifying. The possibility that
Artamonov’s memory might have been unclear was not considered.

that Nosenko was lying because Artamonov's memories of
the schools differed from Nosenko's:

. .'. Adding to the mystery of Nosenko's war-
time years is the information provided by
Nikolay Artamonov, the Soviet naval defector.
When Nosenko's defection was first made public,
Artamonov volunteered the information that, if
this was the same Nosenko who was the son of a
minister, he had attended school with him in
Leningrad. Later, when shown photographs of
Nosenko he positively identified him as the
same man he had known in Leningrad in the ~
period 1944 to 1946 and gratuitously provided
the names of six schoolmates from Leningrad
that Nosenko should remember because they were
prominent members of the student body there.
Nosénko was subsequently queried about three
of these names, but out of context and with

no indication of who and what they might be.

He immediately identified them as schoolmates,
but positively affirmed that two of them had
been the roommates in Kuybyshev in 1941-1942,
while the other had been in the school in Baku.
According to Nosenko, none had gone on to
Leningrad. Of the names provided by Artamonov,
Nosenko mentioned a fourth one independently,
but although he originally placed him in
Leningrad he later moved him to Kuybysnev and
stated categorically that he saw him for the
lust time in Moscow in 1942, before going to
Leningrad. Artamonov, whose own elementary 1
and secondary schooling is a curious parallel i
to Nosenko's, has provided other information on

the schools and dates which Nosenko claims to

have attended which is incompatible with Nosenko's

story but it has not been believed advisable to

requery Artamonov on this until we can be ‘
certain that Artamonov is not deliberately
trying to substantiate Nosenko's bona fides
according to a prearranged plan which misfired
owing to crossed signals or Nosenko's poor
memory.

accuracy (he was right), After transcribing it into
: Russian first, he then transcribed it into English,
: out with one unfortunate mischoice in wording. He
i translated the Russian word "uchilishche" into English
as “academy.” The Russian equivalent to the English
: “academy” in the sense of a college-level institution
te is “akademiya." The following is the 1954's defector's
5 translation of meeting No. 3 on 25 January 1964:

‘ Telling about his entrance into the Naval GRU,
Nosenko says: .. . I went there. . . I com-

} pleted the Institute of International Relations

H in 1949. I studied in the Juridical Faculty,

i specialist in international law and spe-
cializing in the US. Before the Institute, I
studied at the Naval Academy (voyenno-morskoye
uchilishche), etc. In the beginning, I was

5 Still in the Special School (spetsshkola).
Following the Seventh Class of the School, I
then studied at the Preparatory School (podgo-
tovitel'noye uchilishche), was transferred to
the Frunze Academy [sic--uchilishche]. The
war ended. We weren't successful in getting
into battle. The only time they sent us in
was when we were in Baku. There was heavy

i fighting near Tuapse. We students were sent

in near Nov., i.e., near Novorossiysk. There
was heavy fighting there. We took part in these
battles there and then returned when Novorossiysk
surrendered. Our health was gone: less than
one-half of one-third of all the students re-
mained, and they sent us back to the school.

So, the war ended and I didn't finish Frunze
Academy [sic--uchilishche] after demobilization.
What to do? Be a soldier? I didn't want to.
Study? Where? I went to the Institute of
International Relations and entered it in 1945.
And I graduated from there in 1949--the end of
1949 or the beginning of 1950. When the place-
ment commission asked me where I wanted to work--
it is mandatory for the commission to ask--I
said that I was a military man and asked that

ia 1. Nosenko had been misquoted in the
second case officer's transcript, because
the second case officer did not understand
what he was talking about. He had referred
: specifically to the "Leningrad Naval
: Preparatory School named after Frunze," a
fact once again uncovered by the 1954 defector's
rechecking of the meeting tape, but not until
May 1965. When Nosenko “admitted” to his
interrogators in April 1964 that he had not
attended the Academy, he didn't know this was
considered an admission; he never realized
f his interrogators had thought he had made such
: a clain,

2. In general, Nosenko's interrogators
1 overestimated their substantive background.
ay Nosenko's "stories" about the several naval
preparatory schools he had attended during the
war are difficult to follow, because war
conditions brought about a number of reloca-
tions of these schools: the Leningrad School
’ was relocated to Omsk oblast but was still
called Leningrad School; the Moscow School was
relocated first to Achinsk, then to Kuybyshev,
; but was still the Moscow School, etc, Nosenko's

The second point concerns the question of whether
Nosenko lied in claiming that Abidian cased a dead-drop
site in Moscow that we assumed Nosenko knew was crucial
to the KGB apprehension of Oleg Penkovskiy.

On the first point, CIA had no record of Abidian's
having a maid, because he did not formally hire one until
a few months after his last letter mailing for CIA. How-
ever, the maid who served an American woman in the
embassy al-o informally took care of Abidian's apartment
throughout the time period in question. Thus, we were
wrong, Nosenko was right.

‘ The second point has yet to be subjected to con-
firmation, but there is strong circumstantial evidence
that Abidian "cas the Penkovskiv dead-

once, but twice.

Both these problems seems minor in and of themselves.
But they were not minor in the context of the inquisition
to which Nosenko was subjected. Rather, the discrepancies
involved were evoked, as was every other discrepancy
arising from whatever cause, to bolster the case against

information plus that received from Goleniewski and
Golitsyn. Not one of the sources cited below by the
principal case officer had ever been regularly employed
in the Second Chief Directorate--except Nosenko.

In a memorandum of 20 October 1964, the principal
case officer set out to demonstrate at great length
that Nosenko's claim to the position of deputy chief of
the American Embassy Section between early 1960 and late
1961 was completely false. Having informed his readers
that this position was one of the most important in the
entire Second Chief Directorate, he then proceeded to
present a "job description" for it:

As for other aspects of his “job description,"
Nosenko said simply that he did whatever his chisf
told him:to do, and, while he granted that he did
from time to time perform some of the tasks outlined
above, he denied that he had any such fixed administra-
tive responsibilities. He contended that the other
officers in the section were not children and did not
Shar bahe that Nosenko teach them what to do and how to

lo it. :

The outline of the duties of a "deputy chief" was
erroneous, because it was based on a misinterpretation
of the Russian word zanestitel, the term Nosenko applied
to himself when speaking his native language. When the
meaning of this terms was researched in 1968, a clear
distinction was drawn between the American and Soviet
conceptions of a "deputy":

“Zamestitel," or "Deputy," in Soviet bureau-
cratic practice and usage is not limited to
genoting what we think of as the number 2
in the office, but rather is a broader term
which can perhaps most accurately be
rendered in English as “assistant.” Soviet
offices, at least at the higher levels,
commonly have several "Deputies"; some may

with this multiplicity, the Soviet term does
not carry with it the same sense of responsi-
bility and authority paralleling the Chief
and of automatic repjacement as the American
term. The Soviet position of "Deputy" is
probably not as intimately associated with a
Specific slot as is the American position

of Deputy, if indeed it is so associated at
all.

In addition, the outline of a “deputy chief's"
duties can be considered tendentious because it was de-
Signed to establish a criterion of knowledgeability that
Nosenko clearly did not meet. Had the principal case
officer examined the validity of the criterion more
closely, he could easily have determined for himself that
it was unrealistic.

How misleading the Agency's misconceptions could be

Thus, largely because of the influence of Golitsyn,
3 the Agency greatly exaggerated the competence and, in-
’ . deed, the authority of the KGB. Even though this
: defector's claims were often extravagant, they were re-
ceived with very little reserve by senior officials who
in turn applied them across-the-board. On a different
conceptual level, this pattern of exaggeration was applied .
to individual positions within the KGB; since that organiza-
tion was conceived as an all-seeing eye, it seemed to fol-
low that individual officers within it would partake of
its omniscience. Such habits of thought, regrettably,
were self-reinforcing in a situation where the objective
of CI analysis was not to uncover the truth, but rather
to prove that a particular present or former Soviet fet
official was part of a grand plot against the security
of the United States. It made possible constant exciting
discoveries of duplicity on the part of any Soviet source
who came under analysis, simply because he could rarely
ever measure up to our expectations of what he ought to
have known, accomplished, or said. °

Prologue

It is ironic that both Nosenko and Golitsyn
should have become so involved in the retrospective
analysis of the Popov case, because neither knew a
great deal about it. Perhaps they would not have
become thus involved had it not been for the dis-
information hypothesis.

Some time after 19 June 1962 the principal case
officer was given access to tape transcripts of de-
briefings of Anatoliy Golitsyn, the KGB officer who
had defected in Helsinki in December 1961. \

‘In a memorandum written by the principal case
officer dated 27 June 1962, the day after his inter-
view with Golitsyn, he set forth his views on
“Possible Control of [Nosenko]." He opened with a
statement: "Detailed study of [Golitsyn's] produc-
tion in the light of [Nosenko's] has suggested the
possibility that [Nosenko] may be part of a major
Soviet disinformation operation . . ."

Implications of the Popov Case

Unfortunately for Nosenko he had, at the end
of his first meeting with the principal case officer
in 1962, said, "Tomorrow, I'11 tell you how Popov
was caught." Feelings ran high over this case,

Petr Popov was a CIA sourcé within the GRU

to October 1959, when the KGB

rolled up the operation in Moscow. He was the most
important Soviet source CIA had ever had until the
advent of Penkovskiy in 1961. Therefore, any informa-
tion Nosenko might have cn how the KGB had learned

of Popov's clandestine cooperation with CIA was of
great interest.

In Nosenko's discussion of Popov's compromise,
he explained that, in January 1959, the KGB had had

ee

i

under surveillance a member of the American
embassy in Moscow who, they were certain, was
a CIA office: When they
observed this man, Georg- Winters, clandestinely
mailing a letter in Moscow, the KGB intercepted
the letter, found that it was addressed to Petr
Popov, and came to realize that this Soviet was
working for CIA. He was arrested soon there-
after and sent under KGB direction to make
several clandestine meetings with another CIA
officer, Russell Langelle. Finally in October
1959 the KGB apprehended Langelle immediately
after such a meeting, with material in his
possession just received from Popov. The Popov
case was over.

Enter Golitsyn. Originally, his information
concérning the Popov case had been slight. As
of the time of his defection in 1961, he knew
or believed only that:

. a. There had been an agent leak-
ing Soviet military, political and intel-
ligence information to the US.

b. When CIA officer Russell Langelle
was assigned to Moscow, he was going
there to handle “a special agent or mis-
sion...

c. Surveillance of Langelle in Moscow ,
then led the KGB to Popov.

Nosenko, for his part, ‘said much the same thing
but added that the KGB had been led to Langelle
through their surveillance of another CIA officer
in Moscow, George Winters. Unfortunately, to the
principal case officer no statement meant what it
purported to mean. Under Golitsyn’ s influence,

iis doubts concerning Nosenko's bona fides led to
the use of an analytical technique that he described
as trying “to read the case through a mirror to find
its implications if it is bad..." By the time
this June 1962 memorandum was written, the principal
case officer had decided that the story of the Popov
compromise given by Nosenko was the primary area to
determine whether CIA itself had been penetrated by
the KGB.

Golitsyn's 1962 reporting on how Popov
was compromised, i.e., identified by name
through KGB surveillance of Langelle in Moscow
in 1959, varied from Nosenko's story only in the
name of the officer surveilled. The Golitsyn
report was actually completely omitted from a
17 April 1963 memorandum. (Why this omission
passed unnoticed is not explained in any records
in this case.) Yet when Golitsyn gave a com-
pletely different story of the compromise in June
1964, after he had read all the Popov case
materials, this story became the Golitsyn gospel
and has remained so to this day in Golitsyn's
argumentation. We shall come to Golitsyn's 1964
version shortly, but first some additional back-
ground is needed.

Since Nosenko had said that Popov was com-
promised through KGB surveillance of Winters, the
"mirror" technique indicated that this was not
the case. The mental leap from this postulate
was that if surveillance of Winters was not the
cause of the Compromise, then recruitment of Winters
by the KGB was the logical possibility to be ex-
plored.

Kislov, Nosenko had told CIA in 1962, was his
friend in the Soviet Disarmament Delegation in
Geneva with whom Nosenko had gotten drunk on several
occasions. Asked if Kislov was also a KGB officer,
Nosenko specifically denied that he was.

Impact of Penkovskiy's Arrest_on "Popov Compromise
Theory™

Without our going into details on the Penkovskiy

case, it is important to know that in October 1962,
only four months after the first Nosenko meetings,
the KGB dramatically announced the arrest of another
penetration of the GRU--Colonel Oleg Penkovskiy.
This was yet another blow to CIA, even more serious
than the Popov arrest, and a great deal of worried
thought was given to the cause of Penkovskiy's ex-
posure.

Penkovskiy's arrest heightened the suspicions
within CIA--especially Soviet Russian Division--
that there must be a KGB penetration of CIA for
two suc! i ithi

= (like Popov) had been exposed to the
KGB through its omnipresent surveillance in Moscow,
senior SR Division officers interpreted this report
as proof of KGB disinformation designed to conceal
KGB penetration of CIA.

Golitsyn's 1964 Story

In June 1964, while commenting on Nosenko’s
version of the Popov compromise, Golitsyn stated
that the KGB report he had referred to in 1962
stated that the KGB did not consider running Popov
as a double because he could not be trusted. He
then went on to give a completely new story of the
Popov compromise, diametrically opposite to his
original information. :

Golitsyn stated then that a certain Kotov
(first name not given), who had been in the KGB
in Vienna during the period Popov was there, sus-
pected Popov of being a Western agent and made
known his suspicions. At the time, no action was
taken by Kotov's superiors. In 1957 or 1958, how-
ever, when the KGB received similar information
from another source, Kotov was sent to Germany be-
cause he knew Popov and was familiar with his back-
ground. (Contrary to his 1962 report, Golitsyn here
implied strongly that Popov, by name, was identified

by the KGB as a CIA agent in Berlin in 1957
or 195i.) Golitsyn's 1964 story must be evaluated
within the framework of the facts that follow.

On 21 November 1963, Chief, SR recorded the
passage to Golitsyn, through the CI Staff, of all
materials passed to CIA by Popov, including

English language transcrj all operational
pmeetings held with Popov #A
|

Thus, by the time Golitsyn
was commenting on Nosenko's version of the Popov
compromise in June 1964, he had become aware of
everything Popov had told CIA, specifically what
was going on

[In -view of the fact

that Golitsyn's story in June 1964 varied drastically
from that he had told in March 1962, it is legitimate
to suspect that he had recreated a story of Popov's
compromise based on deductions he had made after
reading the Popov transcripts. Thus, the 1’

decision must be thrown out of court.

The Hypothesis that CIA was Penetrated

Unfortunately for the course of events in the
Nosenko case, it was Golitsyn's 1962 version that
was ignored in favor of his “facts” of 1964, which
condemned Nosenko's story as strongly as his 1962
version had supported Nosenko. The reason for this
is obvious. The Popov compromise hypothesis had
been feeding on itself for so long that it had come
to be treated as faci, with the result that the sub-
ject of Popov's compromise became a kind of litmus
paper test of every Soviet source. If a Soviet
source reporting to CIA on Popov agreed with Nosenko
that KGB surveillance, rather than a KGB agent--

@ penetration of CIA--had compromised Popov, then
that Soviet source was held to be a part of an ever-

growing massive KGB conspiracy to protect penetration(s)-

of CIA. By further extension, Nosenko's failure to
produce evidence that Popov and Penkovskiy had been

compromised by a KGB penetration of CIA was
interpreted as proof that indeed such a penetra-
tion must exist.

The acceptance of Golitsyn's story in turn
guaranteed not only that Nosenko could never be
seen as bona fide, but also that all other Soviet
sources must be considered suspect if they supported
Nosenko's story. The overall result was to distort
seriously for a number of years the ability of the
Soviet Bloc Division accurately to evaluate the bona
fides of any defector or agent.

CHAPTER VI

Dezinformatsiya: Origins of the Concept and
Application in the Nosenko Case

Cone

There can be little doubt that the handling Nosenko
received as a supposed dispatched agent would not have taken
place precisely as it did had it not been for the Soviet in-
telligence practice known as dezinformatsiya. Furthermore,
the timing of Nosenko's defection, some months after that of
Golitsyn, the fact that Nosenko provided information on some :
of the same or similar persons or leads as had Golitsyn, and
Golitsyn's conclusion that Nosenko had been dispatched by the
KGB specifically to discredit him (Golitsyn) as part of a
dezinformatsiya operation--all these factors combined to

; preclude “normal" professional treatment of Nosenko. As a
defector, NoSenko's bona fides should have been established,
or not established, on tre basis of careful and sound
analysis and investigation of the information he provided
under standard interrogation procedures. In actuality, he
came under suspicion as a KGB-controlled agent long before
i he presented himself as a defector, and his handling was
therefore based upon this prejudgment.

Dezinformatsiya is a Soviet concept and practice of
long Standing that has been defined or described by numerous ;
sources through the years. Two representative definitions
are as follows:

Petr Deryabin: Dezinformatsiya is the 7
deliberate and purposeful dissemination of false 7
informatiop regarding accomplished facts and/or i
intentions, plans of action, etc., for the pur- an)
pose of misleading the enemy. Such disseminations :
may be accomplished by means of thé press, radio :
and television, agent reports and communications,
operations, etc. The term also refers to the in-
formation itself.

| Anatoliy Golitsyn: In Soviet parlance, the
| term dezinformatsiya is used to denote false, in-

.By means of dezinformatsiya, again according to
Golitsyn, the Soviet government hopes to ensure that the
policy decisions of a gi-en country will be based-on a false
impression of the USSR's domestic or military posture.
Specific measures taken to achieve this end might be designed
to induce a foreign country to engage in costly and useless
research projects, to create a misconception about or adversely
affect the stature of another country in the eyes of the world,
to remove by nonviolent means, such as publicly discrediting,
individuals who are considered a threat to the national
interests of the USSR, or to weaken or dissolve, create or
strengthen certain political parties.

With regard to the definitions quoted above, Deryabin,
Golitsyn and others have spoken from knowledge gained as Soviet
state security officers. However, implicit in all definitions
is the fact that dezinfornatsiye is not an activity that is
the exclusive prerogative of the security organs. It has
always been carried out as a matter of government policy, as
an activity that at times may involve the security organs.

Before 1959, there was no separate dezinformatsiya de-
partment within the KGB (or its predecessor organizations),
although establishment of such a unit had been discussed from
time to time. Each geographic component handling foreign
intelligence operations was responsible for dezinformatsiya
work within its own sphere of activity. All such work was
carried out with the approval of higher authorities within
the KGB, frequently in consultation with the Ministries of
Foreign Affairs and Defense, and even in many instances with
the specific approval of the Central Committee of the CPSU.
It was not until 1959 that responsibility for dezinformatsiya
insofar as it was to be the concern of the First (foreign
intelligence) Chief Directorate of the KGB was centralized
within that unit, and not until 1961 that the concept of

dezinformatsiya played any significant role in the thinking
of CYA counterintelligence officers.

The Sezinformatsiya concept was first highlighted for

L ad while under interrogation follow- i
“ing his derection-im-sanudry 1961. The information he provided
was of major significance, as he had dealt with the KGB on the
subject of dezinformatsiya from as early as 1953-and was in
fact not only a ranking ye1ish intelligence officer but also
a KGB agent. While Goleniewski was not the first source to
refer to dezinformatsiya, he was the first to bring it to

: CIA consciousness as a technique-to be reckoned with in our 4

: analysis of the USSR's foreign policy. It was his claim j
that the Soviet intelligence and counterintelligence ser- : ! r 4
vices played a major role in the implementation of such ‘ . q
policies. j

Specifically, Goleniewski provided information that was
to serve as the basis for premises as to what the KGB would
do upon learning of the defection of a KGB officer.
Goleniewski stated that one of the many objectives of KGB

dezinformatsiya was the protection of Soviet agents by means
OF action designed to mislead Western security services. He
listed among specific objectives and types of dezinformatsiya
operations those designed to confirm unimportant true informa-
tion, thus establishing in the eyes of the opposition the

reliability of a channel through which the KGB passes mislead-
ing information to anti-Soviet governments.

Conversely, another type of dezinformatsiya operation
might be designed to discredit accurate information of signi-

ficance received by the opposition through sources not under
Soviet control, e.g., defectors, thus casting doubt on the
: veracity of the source or sources of this true information.

Goleniewski stated further that the information passed
through dezinformatsiya channels could be based on analysis
of what was already known about any Sensitive items, i.e.,
could stem from defector damage assessments. One means
obviously might be the channeling of information at variance
with that provided by the defector. Another means might be
the provision of "give away" material, which neither added i
to information already in the hands of the opposition nor,
by the same token, did any particular damage to the KGB.
In extreme cases, the KGB would be willing to sacrifice some
of their own agent assets in the interest of enhancing the
reputation of an agent penetration of one of the anti-Communist
intelligence services. (That this latter technique was used
to advantage by the KGB in building Heinz Felfe as a pene-
tration agent within the German Intelligence Service has been
assumed in most analyses of that case. Felfe was a KGB agent
for all of the ten years he worked for the German Intelli- i
gence Service, from 1951 until his arrest in 1961. During i ’
this period Felfe was able to work his way up to the position i
of chief of the Soviet Section of the German counterintelli-
gence staff. It has been postulated that Felfe's rise in the 7 ia
German intelligence ranks was assisted by the KGB, which was
willing to sacrifice less important agent assets to enhance
Felfe's reputation and position as their long-term penetration psoetete
agent. ‘

In all its essentials, the information provided by

Goleniewski was confirmed and elaborated upon by Golitsyn,
who defected in December 1961 and who was the first significant
Soviet or Soviet Bloc defector to come into CIA hands after
Goleniewski. In addition to the general definition of
dezinformatsiya quoted above, Golitsyn said that a KGB (or
GRU) defector's file would be sent to the KGB dezinformatsiya
unit; the latter would search f:. opportunities to exploit
the situation, after review of tne probable areas of informa-
tion revealed to the opposition by the defector. He indicated
in this connection that the Disinformation Department of the
KGB maintained extensive files organized on a topical basis,
containing all information on a given topic that was known
(from the debriefing of defectors to the Soviets, double
agents, captured agents, etc.) to be in the hands of opposi-
tion intelligence services. For example, a KGB officer
assigned to Beirut to work against the American embassy who
defected to CIA would be assumed by the KGB Department of
Disinformation to have told CIA e,erything he knew about
KGB operations against the embassy and embassy personnel.
By reference to their files on Beirut operations, the Depart-
ment of Disinformation would be able to determine the extent
to which KGB operations in that area had been compromised to
CIA.

On the basis of the foregoing information, it might be
assumed that the Golitsyn and Nosenko defections would have
received similar handling by the KGB Department of Disinforma-
tion and by CIA upon their arrival as defectors to the West.
However, the two men were not similarly received by CIA when
they presented themselves as defectors; they received com-
pletely different handling, based on quite different assess-
ment of the information they provided and their motives for
defecting. Golitsyn wastaccepted as a bona fide defector in
relatively short order, while Nosenko was speedily rejected
as a bona fide defector, as explained bélow.

Golitsyn, an officer of the First Chief Directorate of
the KGB, defected to CIA in Helsinki in mid-December 1961.

. Information that he provided relating to the organization

and structure of the KGB was accepted as factual and true,

at least in part because there was relatively little record
information against which it could be compared, but also
because the information appéared to be logical and reasonable.
In addition, he provided voluminous and valuable information
on KGB personalities; available CIA file holdings were
limited, but the information provided by Golitsyn proved to

himself played a curious role in that, as a result of the

label Nosenko as.a deception agent.

This situation arose as follows: During initial contacts
with CIA in 1962, Nosenko provided information on personalities
that was similar to that provided a few months earlier by
Golitsyn. Because CIA counterintelligence officers had been

false information fed to them through no matter what channels,
the "duplication" or "overlapping" information given by Nosenko
was viewed with extreme suspicion. This original doubt led

to information provided by Nosenko being shown to Golitsyn
soon after the former's defection. The paranoid Golitsyn
immediately saw Nosenko as a person sent out to discredit or
even assassinate him.

|
Thereafter, the desire of CIA counterintelligence offi-
cers not to be outwitted by the KGB led them to apply an ana-
lytical technique that has been referred to variously as "double
think” or "mirror reading." This “analysis" led to the con-
clusion that Nosenko, as a dispatched agent, was feeding us
what the KGB wanted us to believe. Thus, everything Nosenko ft
said had to be "interpreted." If he said that the KGB had
been unable to recruit any Americans serving at the US embassy |
in Moscow during a given period, this meant that the KGB had ‘
been quite successful in doing so. If he provided information |

peer sence nese nnd

on a given topic that we had already received from another S
source, this meant that the KGB wanted us to believe that
particular piece of information, hence the other-source un- 4
doubtedly was a KGB agent as well. And so on. Facts were “
discarded or ignored when they did not fit the hypothesis

As of 20 February 1964 the DDP had agreed

that Golitsyn should be brought into the opcration and

given full access to the "Nosenko material."
at this time, given Golitsyn's identification of Nosenko's
function as a false defector, was that the Nosenko operation
was "the reverse of the Golitsyn coin" and thus that Golitsyn's
assistance was required to pursue it properly.
over the next several months Golitsyn was provided with
material from the 1962 and 1964 meetings with Nosenko and at
his request was supplied with all available biographic data

on Nosenko to assist him in "analyzing" the operation.

On 29 June 1964 Golitsyn was interviewed by Chief, CI

Staf£, Deputy Chief, CI Staff and Chief, SR Division.

following is quoted from the transcripts of this meeting:

named or recommended by them and the KGB
gave these people a chance. They are

very energetic--all of them. And, of
course, they discuss things among themselves.
Many of them had made mistakes--they had
told too much. They were, therefore, in

the damage report (on my defection) and

for them the only way to act was to suggest
an operation against me in order to save
their face, to save the situation.

It can be argued that Golitsyn had two interests: (a)
to discredit Nosenko in order to maintain a position of pre-
eminence as advisor to CIA (and other Western intelligence
services) on Soviet intelligence matters, and (b) to promote
his contentions as to how the West was being deceived by the
Soviet Union.in political and strategic matters, and thus
to enhance his position as advisor to governments on overall
Soviet political matters.

Golitsyn clearly had a high opinion of himself. When
he defected, he brought with him some 23 classified docu-
ments from the Soviet embassy in Helsinki, which he made
clear he wished to discuss with President Kennedy and the
Director of Central Intelligence personally, to alert them
to what was going on and to measures needing to be taken.
Moreover, his willingness to cooperate with CIA and other
US government agencies underwent changes from time to time,
depending upon whether his demands for access to and inter-
views with specified ranking officials of those organizations
were granted.

Golitsyn's chosen role as igterpreter of Soviet policy
and anti-Western actions was threatened by the arrival of
Nosenko. His response was to gain access to virtually all
of CIA's files on -Nosenko for purposes of providing CIA with
an “interpretation “of the latter's role. In any event, the
idea took hold within CIA as a result of Golitsyn's hammer-
ing away at this theme that we were being “had" by the
Soviets, particularly by being penetrated as a result of
clever KGB counterintelligence operations, and that Nosenko
had to be "broken" at all costs; his "confession" would make
clear to us the details and dimensions of the Soviet
machinations.

Further, it was deemed expedient not only to proceed
with efforts to "break" Nosenko but also to study past

operations known to have been Soviet-controlled to see what
could be learned from these cases about how the Soviet in-
telligence services had carried out their activities against
the West through the years. This study of historic Soviet
cases, designed not to explore a hypothesis but to prove an
already-accepted thesis, produced information about an awe-
some “eneny," cunning and complex, lavishing money and man-
power on operations that were almost invariably successful.
The fact that many of these cases were primarily of historic
interest, undertaken at a particular time to take advantage
of or exploit a particular situation that no longer obtained
or had little or no pertinence to Nosenko's defection, appears
to have been discounted. On the contrary, since the cases
included in the study were considered to have been hugely
successful in duping or deluding the Western intelligence
services and governments, it was concluded that we were con-
tinuing to be deluded and duped. It was reasoned that, as
CIA and other Western intelligence services became increas-
ingly aware of and informed on the Soviet operational tech-
niques being used against them and changed their operational
‘ tactics accordingly, the KGB simply adjusted to the new
situation and continued to outwit us. With Shelepin and
+ succeeding chiefs of the KGB as members of the Central Com-
y mittee, it was assumed that those KGB operations that could
j be (or were) classed as dezinformatsiya were not only
‘ important per se but took on added importance inasmuch as
| the KGB, through its chief, was involved in the policy making
| body of the Soviet Union. Consequently, any operation as
| important as the one that involved sending a senior KGB
i officer, Nosenko, to the West on a dezinformatsiya mission _
i must have been an exceedingly important one, involving high-

level staff coordination. Any other agents who provided
confirmatory information or whose information could in any
way be regarded as suspiciously coincidental had to be part
of the overall operation. Given the importance of the opera-
tion, Chairman Khrushchev was undoubtedly directing the
whole thing himself.

j
i
No attention was paid to the fact that, despite the
assertions of Goleniewski and Golitsyn, there was no known
case of a KGB officer's ever having been sent to discredit a
previous defector in the eyes of a Western intelligence
| service. After brief consideration of the notion that

Nosenko might not even be a member of the KGB at all, it was
: decided that the KGB had dispatched him to counter Golitsyn.

Conclusions

: In retrospect, it seems worthwhile to point out that
: (a) in the years since Nosenko's first contact and subsequent
i defection, no information has ever been developed to sub-
stantiate the charges made against him either by Golitsyn i
or by the “mirror-readers"; (b) Golitsyn's information with |
i respect to dezinformatsiya has not been internally consistent; t
7 and (c) Golitsyn himself as the architect and sponsor of i
: theories presented has not been able to support his claims, t
despite the wealth of information made available to him for £
analysis. The following is quoted from an unsigned paper, H

dated 10 September 1968, in summation of Golitsyn's claims:

oneal len micas

i Golitsyn's overall thesis, that the Soviet

leadership in 1959 developed a "New Policy"

(peaceful coexistence, non-violent tactics,

united front, etc.) is perfectly acceptable

as a statement of the "Right" strategy

developed during the mid- and late-fifties :
and enshrined in the November 1960 Moscow i

Manifesto. Golitsyn's depiction of this
policy as, in toto, a "misinformation"
operation rests upon his extremely broad
use of that term: “special deliberate t
efforts of the communist governments to i
mislead Western studies and to direct them i
in wrong directions" by means of official {
Soviet speeches and Party documents, offi-
cial press and propaganda outlets, travel j
controls, diplomatic activities, leaks, etc.
His vocabulary and general handling of this | bd

new Bloc policy gives the strategy a con-
spiratorial quality not justified by its
essentially open and public character.

CHAPTER _
Solitsyn Vs. Nosenko: ‘A. Comparison
0: ieir Handling: By A

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the differ-
ences in handling by CIA of the two KGB defectors, Anatoliy
Golitsyn and Yuriy Nosenko. Comparison is material to this
study, since it was Golitsyn's "confirmation" of certain
theories regarding Nosenko as a dispatched agent that helped
to establish the standards by which CIA judged Nosenko when
he walked in some months after Golitsyn. It is also material,
since Golitsyn played a role in CIA efforts to "break" Nosenko.
Brief discussion of the treatment given the two men follows.

Interrogation

The defections of Colitsyn and Nosenko cannot be con-
sidered directly comparable, since some five meetings were
held with Nosenko about eighteen months before his actual
defection. There had been no similar contact with Golitsyn
before his defection. However, the following statements can
be made.

Golitsyn was brought to this country within days of his
defection in Helsinki in December 1961. Standard interroga-
tion procedures were initiated, which included his systematic
debriefing regarding his own biographic data, family back-
ground and career, and his knowledge of the structure, organiza-
tion, personalities and operations of the KGB. What he said
was checked against CIA files and formed the-basis for his
acceptance within weeks of arrival in the United States as a
bona fide defector.

In Nosenko's case, he cannot be said to have been inter-
rogated at all, in the strict sense of the word, during
initial contacts with him in Geneva in June 1962. For one
thing, he evinced no desire to defect at that time but simply
offered certain pieces of information that he thought would
be of interest to CIA, in exchange for a specified sum of
money anne he claimed to need. Also, time with him was
limited.

When Nosenko actually defected in February 1964, he

was interrogated in a manner that contrasted sharply” with that
applied in Golitsyn's case. In the interim between initial

-124-

contacts in 1962 and his defection in 1964, as previously
explained, it had been concluded that he was a dispatched
agent. Voluminous papers had been written during this
period "proving" that such was the case, and because of
the accumulated "evidence" it was decided to attempt to
"break" him as soon as possible. Accordingly, and because
it was also belicved imperative to act quickly, Nosenko's
interrogation took place in various pre-planned stages or
phases, ranging from ostensibly friendly to hostile.

In Nosenko's case, then, the entire effort was to force
him to admit to CIA's accusations rather than to obtain in-
formation from him in any logical or systematic fashion.
Efforts were made to “trap him or "throw him off balance,"
by indicating that CIA had "proof" that he was lying, that
his only option was to “confess” that he had been sent by
the KGB, etc. His denials of charges or refusals to "con-
fess" only resulted in increasingly hostile treatment. While
his statements did contain inconsistencies, and there were
questions for which he gave no adequate or consistent and
logical answers, the manner in which he was questioned was
in no way that afforded the usual defector. Moreover, the
pressures put upon Nosenko contributed to the creation of
a climate not conducive to proper interrogation. It was not
until October 1967, in fact, that he received a proper in-
terrogation.

Polygraph Examination

As with other phases of their respective handling, the
account of Nosenko's polygraph examinations is in marked con-
trast with that of Golitsyn.

home to him that the test was an absolute requirement for
receipt of resident alien status in the United States. .

The unusual manner in which the tests were conducted
is illustrated in the following quotations from the report
later submitted by the polygraph operator:

The undersigned had a series of prepolygraph
conferences with {Chicf}, SR/CI [a] CI Staff
officer, and [an officer] of the Office of
Security. The general consensus of the
interested parties regarding what areas
should and should not be covered during
polygraph testing all reflected the fact

Although the operator was fluent in Russian, the test

‘was given to Golitsyn on 27 March 1962 in English; Russian

was used only when Golitsyn failed to comprehend the full
and accurate meaning of a question. Golitsyn raised no
objections to any questions asked, but the operator did not
consider the day's testing conclusive, because of the dif-
ficulties that had arisen owing to Golitsyn's poor compre-
hension of English plus a malfunctioning polygraph.

A second test was therefore given the following day,
28 March, in the Russian language, during the course of
which Golitsyn was asked the same questions as on the previ-
ous day. Before the test could be initiated, however,
Golitsyn again had to be convinced of the necessity for
taking it. He stated that he had thought over the ques-

tions he had been ious day. and he considere
_them "insulting."

\

\ ‘In the operator's words, he
resented “all in all, any and every question which may have
reflected that he was not accepted 100 percent on the basis
of only his own explanations and assurances." Nevetheless,
the test was finally conducted. Upon its completion, the
operator informed Golitsyn that he (the operator) had con-
cluded that Golitsyn was substantially truthful in his
answers and that, as far as the operator was concerned, the
results were favorable.

Six months later, the Office of Security reviewed the
polygraph charts, as well as the questions that had been
posed, the transcriptions of the interviews, and the final
report. On 19 September 1962, a memorandum was prepared for
the chief of the Interrogation and Research Division of the
Office of Security. The report contained the following
initial statements:

A review of [the operator's report on the
testing of Golitsyn] reflects everything —

This should not be considered any definitive
[polygraph examination]. The conditions and
limitations placed on the [polygraph] offi-
cer as reflected in the body of the report
imposed a set of conditions that preclude

and make impossible any unequivocal state-
ment that a conclusive (polygraph examination]
was conducted.

The use of the polygraph in Nosenko's case contrasts
sharply with the way it was used on Golitsyn. We shall not
go into detail here, because Nosenko's polygraph examinations
are covered at length in Chapter VIII. It is relevant here,
however, to make the point that those polygraph examinations
of both Golitsyn and Nosenko performed prior to 1968 were all

Practically from the moment of his arrival in this
country, Golitsyn began to demand access to CIA files.
He largely achieved his ends and was soon being given
transcripts of his own debriefing sessions as well as

CIA comments as appropriate; an outline of infer-
mation provided by Nosenko on the structure and
personnel assignments in the KGB as he knew them;
a chronology of Nosenko's life “in varying ver-
sions."

By contrast, the CIA position with regard to revelation
of information to Nosenko is indicated by the following state-
ment taken from a memorandum for the DDP prepared by Chief,
SR Division, dated 30 March 1964:

For information on Nosenko's of
any sort for long periods of time, much less intelligence
files of the sort given to Golitsyn, see Chapter III.

Physical Confinement

Golitsyn cannot be said to have been physically confined
at any time. The following description of the protective
custody afforded him and his reaction to any type of control
is quoted from the 1976 Counterintelligence Staff Study
(No. 3) on Golitsyn:

Golitsyn always felt the need for protection
against possible KGB retaliation, but quite
obviously believed he alone was the best
judge of what this entailed. He wanted
guards around, but not underfoot. The record
is replete with his complaints against the
guards and his attempts to isolate them.
This became a key issue in the adoption of
the codicil to the Statement of Agreement
in July 1962, when Golitsyn moved into his
own house and was given complete personal
control of the guards, their hours of duty
and their responsibilities. From that point
on, Golitsyn was essentially unguarded. His

wife also railed against her "companions"
in the early days. She made frequent trips
into Washington to shop or attend movies,
theater or ballet. At these times, she
would dismiss her chauffeur for lengthy
periods. On two occasions she took the bus
alone to New York for the day, and Golitsyn
also visited New York in November 1962, at
which time he roamed the city unescorted.

Golitsyn's behavior from that time on followed a similar
pattern. He suddenly left the United States for the United
Kingdom in December 1962, and while in England he lived where
he wished and had no security protection. The British asked.
Golitsyn to keep his whereabouts to himself, not to stay in
one hotel for any length of time, and to call when he wanted
to meet. According to the study quoted above, this loose
method of dealing with Golitsyn probably helped in maintain-
ing a cooperative attituce on his part; it also apparently
set a precedent for his attitude toward the manner in which
he would live upon his return to the United States in July
1963. Upon his return here, he was given complete freedom
to set his own pattern of living and working, following the
British example. He obtained his own residence in New York,
moved several times, developed the concept that he was the
best judge of his own security, and at times lived "alnost
under the eaves of the Soviet Mission” in New York while
simultaneously refusing to talk to CIA officers because CIA
was “penetrated.”

Nosenko's physical confinement and deprivation of even
minor amenities from the time of his defection in early 196%
until late October 1967 stand in stark contrast to the treat-
ment afforded Golitsyn. This matter has been covered so
fully in Chapter III that it requires ng further comment.

Conclusions

If summation is needed, the following can be stated with
respect to the five areas dealt with above:

A. Golitsyn controlled his own interrogation,
withholding information if he chose, refusing to |
answer questions according to his own whim, and
on occasion refusing even to talk to CIA officers.
Nosenko was not really listened to (or even talked
to for long stretches of time), much less properly

B. Golitsyn-wa's given a signed agreement
covering the conditions of his cooperation with
the US government, which met all of his demands.
Nosenko was specifically denied a written contract,
on the grounds that an oral agreement was the
“bureaucratically correct" manner of handling his
relationship with the US government, until five
years after his defection (1969).

C. Golitsyn's polygraph examination was admin-
istered under ground rules imposed by SR Division.
These rules produced inconclusive test results,
but full assurances were given Golitsyn that he
had passed his examination. No further attempt
was made to establish Golitsyn's bona fides.
Nosenko, on the other hand, underwent three separate
series of polygraph tests. Two of the three were
conducted in such a manner as to prejudice the re-
sults. against Nosenko; under the ground rules im-
posed by the SR Division officers on the polygraph
operator, the latter was under instructions to
"find" evidences of deception in the polygraph
charts, whether they were there or not.

E. As to physical confinement, Golitsyn was
simply never confined; the thought of confining
him did not even arise. Nosenko spent virtually
all of his first five years in this country as
a@ prisoner, given fewer amenities than he would
have received in most jails or prisons within
the United States, or in some form’of protective
custody. -

It seems self-evident that these two defectors should
have received the same treatment, that one was as suspect

CHAPTER VIII

Use of the Polygraph in the Nosenko Case

Nosenko was first polygraphed on 4 April 1964, in a
series of six tests, That the procedures followed were
somewhat unorthodox is indicated by the following quotations
from the report of the polygraph operator:

During the pre-polygraph conferences with
representatives of SR Division, the under-
signed was informed that the polygraph
interview was part of an overall plan to
help break [Nosenko) and elicit the truth
from him. SR Division's instructions were
that, regardless of whether [Nosenko]
passed his polygraph test or not, he was
to be informed at the termination of his
polygraph interview that he was lying, and
had not passed his polygraph interview.

The question of [Nosenko's] willingness to
participate in the polygraph test was one of
minor consideration, since he had, on previ-
ous occasions, agreed that he would take the
test. However, whether [Nosenko] would con-
tinue with the polygraph testing, if he was
confronted with attempted deception after

an initial test run, was one of the considered
problems, Consequently, in order to preclude
the possibility of [Nosenko's] terminating the
test prior to its completion, it was decided
that a minor deviation from the accepted
polygraph technique would be ysed during the
polygraph testing, specifically to ensure that
@ polygraph record of [Nosenko's] reactions
to all the pertinent questions be obtained
prior to challenging him on any significant
polygraph deception indications his charts
hight reflect. Because of the extenuating
(sic] circumstances of the case, this plan
was followed throughout the polygraph inter-
view.

CHAPTER IX
Psychological and Medical Findings

A small, but nevertheless key role was played by two
Agency specialists, respectively a psychologist and a
psychiatrist, in the handling of Nosenko. Like so much
else that occurred in this case, this aspect is edifying
mainly in the negative sense of demonstrating how the ser-
vices of such professionals ought not to be exploited. In
sum, the psychologist and psychiatrist principally involved
in this case were given enough misinformation about Nosenko's
bona fides to prejudice seriously any chance of an accurate

personality assessment.

We now examine in some detail the roles played by the
psychologist-and the psychiatrist. In doing so, we have
very much in mind the fact that both these gentlemen are
members of organized professions, both of which impose
explicit standards of conduct upon their members. We must
therefore look for possible conflict between demands the
Agency made of these professionals on one hand, and their
professional standards on the other.

A. The Role of the Psychologist

The psychologist's role will be dealt with first
because, to judge by the written record, he was the
first to assess Nosenko from the psychological point

of view, by means of a brief interview and test administered

on 23 June 1964. His initial report is dated 9 July 1964.
In addition, he interviewed Nosenko at length in 14 ses-
sions during the period 3-21 May 1965. He then wrote a
chronicle of Nosenko's life and an éverall psychological
evaluation based on these interviews.

By way of background, it should be said that the

Like any other scientific practitioner, however,
a psychologist can only function properly on the
basis of valid data. If you put a cube of ice in a
patient's mouth before inserting the thermometer, you
do not get an accurate temperature reading. If you
provide an examining psychologist or psychiatrist
with erroneous data regarding a defector, the findings
of his examination will inevitably be in part erroneous.

Personality assessment instruments, or "tests,"
also have their limitations. They yield results that
should be read only as statements of the statistical
probability of the presence of a given personality
predisposition or characteristic. In other words, the
results give the psychologist a suggestion as to what
to look for in a person, as he collects further data.

In the case here under consideration, the personality
formula that the psychologist derived from his administra-
tion of the PAS test .<o Nosenko suggested that Nosenko
might have the characteristics of a sociopath. The
psychologist's task was then to evaluate this datum
within a framework that included the following elements:

1. His judgment of the validity of his
own test results. Note that he depended on a
single, English-language measurement instru-
ment when he examined Nosenko on 23 June 1964.

2. Personal interviews. He had time for

only a limited interview at the time of test-
ing, and it was conducted without benefit of
an interpreter in English, a language Nosenko
spoke with far from idiomatic fluency.
Lengthy interviews were conducted later, in
May 1965, long after the original diagnosis
had been made. They also were’ conducted in
English.

3, Collateral data, obtained from senior
SR officers, which were uniformly prejudicial
to Nosenko. The latter was described as one
who lied and changed his story constantly, and
who had been sent to the United States on a
mission for the KGB. Doubt was even expressed
as to whether Nosenko was the person he. professed
to be.

Subsequent events have revealed that Nosenko's ,
falsehoods were in fact minor ones. But the psychologist
did not know-all this; told that Nosenko lied constantly
and knowing that manipulative lying is part of the
psychopathic syndrome, he diagnosed Nosenko as a psycho-
path, : -

The term “psychopat. (another term used inter- sf
; changeably is “sociopath") itself deserved a word of : t 7
i explanation, because its connotation is misleading. A ra }
: Like so many psychological terms, it evolved out of the ot i]
fact that psychologists tend to be involved primarily Ba
with people in trouble, very often with those who end up
in prisons: and mental institutions. A survey of psycho-
logical literature reveals, not surprisingly, that the
one quintessential criterion of a psychopath is that he
is habitually given to criminal or delinquent behavior.
The critéria that psychologists use in distinguishing
between psychopaths and non-psychopaths have been i
developed almost entirely from studies of juvenile . 4
delinquents, criminals and mental patients, and thus the y
term is really only applicable with any certainty to in-
dividuals belonging to one or another of those groups.
Despite this fact, testing of many people who are not }
delinquent or criminal may yield a score or profile
of scores suggesting psychopathy. To illustrate the |
point, let us take an example. On the Minnesota : [
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (one of the most widely
used Clinical testing instruments in this country), the
profile that suggests psychopathy has also been generated i
in testing persons who turned out to be good WACs in
World War II and others who have been predicted as
likely to succeed in the life insurance business. Yet, |
good WACs and life insurance agents are obviously not
groups to whom we would ordinarily apply the term

“psychopath.” Thus, the fact that you have a predis-

sition to psychopathy does not mean that you necessarily
ecome one; the psychopathic profile on either the MMPI :
or the PAS test is merely a warning signal of what you .
might do under certain adverse circumstances.

was functioning. He was unaware of the manner of his

sudden confinement after glowing promises had been made -
of rewards for defection; of the falsified polygraph
results, and the fact that Nosenko had been informed

i that the examination showed him guilty of deception;

- or of the fact that the principal case officer had

ie told Nosenko that the latter's information (later te
prove of great value) was all “crap.” Given these
factors, we would have to conclude a priori that the
resultant PAS personality profile was likely to be
partly spurious.

The exact extent to which the psychologist's test
results were inexact cannot be determined, but one
example is illustrative of the possibilities. One part
of the profile suggested that Nosenko was e1dowed with
a well-below average memory. That his memory was
functioning at less than average level at the time he
took the test cannot be doubted; but it has already
been made clear that he was functioning under extremely
Hy adverse conditions, and, since the Wechsler subtest that
’ measures memory span has been experimentally shown to be
4 vulnerable to so-called state (i.e., temporary) anxiety,*°
this aspect of the personality profile must be considered

i spurious. From Nosenko's performance during extensive

i debriefings since he was released from confinement and

» began to receive normally humane treatment, we know that
his memory is in fact exceptionally good. We can only
conclude that, if it functioned badly at the time of test-
ing, this was largely owing to anxiety induced by treat-
ment received at the hands of CIA.

As to the psychologist’s characterization of

Nosenko as a psychopath, the limitations of such a
diagnosis have already been made clear. Since his re-
lease from incarceration, although he has certainly shown
himself to be an emphathic person, winning and charming
when he wants to be, he has not shown any of the unde-
Sirable traits associated with psychopathy. Quite to
the contrary, as of this time at least, he has since
1969 comported himself with both dignity and discretion.

entitled "Vulnerabilities" that was, once again, clearly
based on the premise that Nosenko was dissembling, when

he denied being under continued KGB control. The psychologist
wrote: :

Under prolonged pressure he will admit almost if
anything to get relief. Another vulnerability :
is that he will “break" in order to get relief.

Care should be taken to continue pressure for

some time after an initial break is secured

to allow for vacillation and modification.

Long periods of isolation after these breaks

may be useful in evaluating the reliability |
of his information. In general, it is better ?
to give him slight rewards (e.g., Cigarettes, if
baths, etc.) for no apparent reason than to |
tie them to periods of cooperation, etc.

The psychologist's last major involvement in the | q
case appears to have been the series of debriefings having E
to do with Nosenko's personal history, conducted during ‘ ie
the period 3-21 May 1965. These led the psychologist to .
the following conclusions and rcommendations: Ha

1. Nosenko's story was consistent with i
the previous diagnosis of a “bright sociopath" of
(i.e., psychopath).

2. The psychologist was “totally at a }

as a legend. Nothing could be served other i
than to discredit the man to whom it was as- f

_ the proper editorial changes--
emphasizing the class distinctions
and privileges in a classless society
could be most humiliating to the
Soviets. In addition, we could take
the gamble of demonstrating that de-
fection is an honorable act of moti-
vated men, The US has no room for
the misfits and failures of the Soviet
system.

The above findings were still insufficient for some
of the SR Division personnel, who then drafted a series
of very specific questions to be put to the psychologist.
Of these the first three will be quoted, together with
the psychologist's answers:

1. This man's story is full of demon-
strable lies. Often these lies seem point-
less--no matter from what point of view
they are studied. When challenged, he will
sometimes retreat from one of his stories;
in other instances, he will cling adamantly
to one even when it is clear to all that he
is lying and even when he has an easy way
out. In other words, his lies, distortions
and rationalizations are harder to under-
stand than those of most "normal" people.

In_your opinion, when he lies, does he do so:

a. because he is a compulsive

liar; i
(Answer: No.)

b. because he seeks to bolster
his stature and ego for his own reasons;
(Answer: Essentially yes.)

c. because the KGB told him to.
(Answer: Perhaps.)

2. Do the incidence and nature of his in-
accuracies and distortions add up to a behavior
pattern that might reasonably be called "normal"?
If not, how can it be described in layman's
terms? Ee
(Answer: Not a "normal" personality but legally
normal and not hospitalizeable.)

SECRET

pte: caren mniinameetme rep rarmnn



SECRET

-148-

3. If his behavior pattern is not
"normal," could it be counterfeit, either
for personal reasons or because he was
briefed to comport himself this way?
Could he play such a role over a considerable :
period of time? : :
(Answer: Absolutely not.)

H When at long last, in February 1968, SB Division
: concluded its long-awaited study of the Nosenko case,
the findings of the psychologist were included in the
following abbreviated form:

Nosenko is a rationalizer, a distorter, and

an evasive person clearly capable of dis-

sembling for personal reasons. He is not

a compulsive liar. He is inclined to relate

H what he thinks he is expected to say rather
than to tell the truth as he knows it. He

: lies by design as well as for effect, however, i

; and he does not always embroider just to

} bolster his ego. He is neither "insane" nor

‘ psychotic, and he suffers from no "delusions."

! Nosenko's rationalizations are not the pro-

! duct of derangement. ‘

The most notable quality of this summary is its
selectivity. For example:

1. The summary nowhere mentioned the

diagnosis of Nosenko as a psychopath/sociopath.

The fact that psychopaths generally try to
i evade the penalties of their misbehavior by Bee
i adaptive role-playing (e.g., sudden religious +
| “conversions” to win sympathy and "prove" they : i
| are changing their ways) could’have served : ase)
| dangerously to undercut the thesis that

Nosenko was sufficiently dedicated to persist
in carrying out a long-term KGB plot in face

aes nities gon | GNM aies mse

of the sort of treatment he had received
since 4 April 1964.

2. By the above-cited omission, it tends
to establish a dichotomy between the "insane"
or “psychotic,” who suffer "delusions,". and :
"normal" people, who tell the truth. It
carefully skirted the existence of a middle

ground between normality and psychoticism
in which people do not behave "normally"
but are not insane. Yet this distinc-
tion had been drawn specifically in“ answer
to one of the SR Division questioned: quoted
above. i

Enough has been said to make clear that the psycholo-
gist was put in an impossible position. On the basis of
the "facts" provided him, he was frankly puzzled as to how
Nosenko could have been selected for a KGB mission in-
volving extended dissimulation.

The psychologist was not sure enough of his ground
to stick to his guns. As a psychologist who had dealt
previously with a number of Soviet defectors, he had a
great degree of insight. On the other hand, he knew
that he did not have all the facts, beczise Chief, SR
had specifically told him so. Insight is of very little
use when not based on adequate data.

Helms tried to help. When told by the psychologist
that the latter did not have all the facts necessary to
make a judgment about Nosenko, Helms called Chief, SR
and instructed him that the psychologist should be fully
informed. This instruction appears to have been disre-
garded,

We can only conclude that the psychologist did what
could legitimately be expected of him, within the con-
Straints of the Agency's command structure. * The weak-
nesses that in retrospect we can perceive in the
psychologist's diagnosis and recommendations can be as-
cribed directly to his being asked to make professional
judgments based on inadequate knowledge. The propriety
of the Agency's employing a professional in this manner
should be carefully reviewed.

The Role of the Psychiatrist

The psychiatrist's role in the Nosenko operation
was more extensive and of longer duration than the
psychologist's. In addition to physical examinations,
it included giving advice on how Nosenko should be treated
while in confinement, advice on special interrogation
techniques such as the use of sodium pentothal, and an
assessment of Nosenko's personality.

The psychiatrist has stated (in discussions
with the senior author of this report) c<hat he had it
been told when he was first assigned to the case that
Nosenko was concealing information of great importance
to the US government. That he worked throughout th
case under this assumption is evident from the total
context of his reporting. On the other hand, there
is. no evidence that either SR Division or CI Staff
shared the reasons for their suspicions with him to a
sufficient extent for him to have evaluated their
claim, even had he been qualified by professional
background to make such an evaluation. He knew and
accepted his limitations in the latter regard; for
example, in a report dated 23 February 1965, after
he had spent an hour observing an interrogation, he
remarked:

{Nosenko] comes off [in] his responses to
questions (at least when I saw him) in the
same fashion as always though I am not

ompetent to judge the content of what he
says. TUnderiinsng added.

Yet, even theugh the psychiatrist was not an “opera-
tions officer" according to normal Agency criteria,
during his long association with this case (which included
34 examinations of Nosenko in the year 1964 alone) he
acted in more than a purely medical capacity. Not only
did he check on Nosenko's health and endeavor to safeguard
it, he also advised the operational component of the
Agency on certain aspects of their own specialized

activities to which his medical and psychiatric knowledge :

appeared relevant. In this latter capacity, the psychi-
atrist's name was invoked frequently in operational
correspondence, generally without his knowledge; fer
example, in a 27 November 1964 memorandum to the DDP,
concerning arrangements for forthcoming interrogations,
Chief, SR stated: 7

Given . . . the assessment by both [the psychi-
atrist} and [the psychologist] that Subject is

a compulsive talker, we are hopeful that we will
make some progress.

by implication, this and other similar references evoked
the

recondite expertise of the psychiatric and psycholog-
ical professionals to bolster claims of impending success.

Thus, it was only natural that the psychiatrist,
having been told by senior Agency officials that
Nosenko was consistently lying about his true mis-
sion, should accept their views. Unlike the psycholo-
gist, he did not even have the advantage of having
systematically debriefed Nosenko on his life history;
had he done so, he might have shared the psycholo-
gist's suspicions that the SR Division opinion of
Nosenko was not beyond legitimate challenge.

Nevertheless, the anomalous situation in which

‘the psychiatrist was placed had two unfortunate

consequences:

1. Because he was led to assume that
Nosenko was systematically lying, his
diagnosis was somewhat distorted.

2. The same assumption led him to
play a quasioperational role in the handling
of Nosenko.

Let us look in greater depth at the first consequence.
In so doing, it is not our purpose to second-guess a
qualified psychiatrist; rather, it is our purpose to
ascertain whether this particular professional, well
known to his colleagues for his devotion to duty, was
in fact given a fair opportunity to make an honest
evaluation.

The psychiatrist's diagnosis of Nosenko, which
he labeled "Psychiatric Impressions," was dated 20 siteee]
Necember 1964. It read in part: i

Psychiatric impression is that of an individual
who shows an above average intelligence capacity,
is shrewd and perceptive. While he claims to
have desired to cooperate and work with US
officials, his antisocial behavior was destruc-
tive and self-defeating to the aims he claimed
to pursue. His own needs and desires are of
paramount importance to him and he manipulates :
those around him without regard to consequence ‘
in order to satisfy his needs. As such he tends
5 to be selfish, ungrateful, narcissistic and
{ exhibitionistic. In satisfying his own desires
: : there is no concern for the feelings or interests
a of others. There has been no evidence of a
sense of honor or of shame. He has seen
nothing wrong with his own behavior, being unable
to view this from another's viewpoint. For most
of his adult life, it is reasonable to expect
fe that he has operated in this manner--without
: conscience, without guilt and has directed his
efforts at satisfying his own needs. He may i
at times give the impression of being a reliable
and steadfast person, but after gaining security
for himself and the confidence of others, can
shrug off major obligations easily. As with f
many individuals of this personality makeup,
ates his disregard for the truth is remarkable.

away with a lie or whether detection is almost ;

i mitting the most serious of perjuries, it is

constant brushes with authority. As he grew
7 older this behavior most likely continued in
the same pattern with occasional brushes with
the law and perhaps some punishment. But the ‘ iy
effectiveness of his ability to manipulate : i
and protect himself by personable appeals may t
have kept him in circulation in society on
the fringe, so to speak. His reaction to his
restricted environment is not unusual, as
some such individuals come to accommodate to
some limits imposed by authority while at the
same time not accepting the seriousness of ae
their situation and believing that, as in the
past, they can talk their way out. This man '
is capable of playing a role and playing it t
effectively.

On 1 October 1976, the above evaluation was discussed
with the psychiatrist in the light of facts previously aes
unknown to him. Inter alia, he was given (in writing)
background on the following aspects of the Nosenko case:

E 1. CIA promises of substantial monetary
rewards and an opportunity for Nosenko to work
with CIA on a salaried basis. foe

: 2, The conciusion of the Director of
Securigy, as of 30 September 1976, that "Mr.
Nosenko was truthful and that he had not
given false information to his CIA debriefing
officers."

3. Acceptance of Nosenko’s bona fides
by both FBI and CIA. Crore acre

The memorandum of conversation dictated by the

senior author following the above discussion reads in

judgments which he had made, were all heavily
dependent on “collateral information" which
he obtained from -epresentatives of the SB
Division. He agreed that, had he known the
facts as stated in my memorandum, his psychi-
atric. judgments might have differed from
those he actually made.

In connection with some of the specific points
raised.in my memorandum, [the psychiatrist]
made the following observations:

.« [1]. He was not aware of the
‘financial or other promises made to
Nosenko, and perhaps assumed that
Nosenko, like most defectors, was
angling for large rewards. [The
psychiatrist] mentioned Golitsyn
as among the precedents which he
probably had in mind...

{2}. In regard to Nosenko's
alleged lying and deception, he was
totatly dependent upon the judgments
of SB Division personnel as well as
that of [a polygraph operator}.

[The psychiatrist] stated that, until he read my
1 October 1976 memorandum, he had never known
that Nosenko had contributed valuable informa-
tion. He had also never received any informa-
tion concerning Nosenko's behavior since his
being released from incarceration . . .

We are thus justified in concluding that, in the
psychiatrist's case as in that of the psychologist, a
professional was not given the proper “collateral in-
formation" on the basis of which to render a sound profes-
sional judgment. More explicitly, because neither the
psychiatrist nor psychologist was accurately informed
even about such basic aspects of the case as the promises
made to Nosenko (which could not possibly be considered
to have had sensitive security implications), neither
man had an accurate criterion for judging the appropri-
ateness of Nosenko's behavior in seeking better treatment. -

i Given the apparent consensus among the Agency's
leadership that there were good and sufficient reasons
for incarcerating and trying to “break” Nosenko, it is
not surprising in hindsight that the psychiatrist offered
judgments and advice extending well beyond the bounds of
conventional medicine and psychiatry. Since his quasi-

+ operational participation in this case has been covered

to some degree in Chapter III, we need only reevoke a

few examples here:

7 ~-His judgment of 24 February 1966 that "things
P are bound to change as far as Nosenko is con-
cerned--he is either going to stop faking or
things will get worse."

--His judgment, reported on 26 April 1966,
that reestablishing contact between Nosenko
and the interrogators would be a serious mis-
take because it would constitute a “relief.”

scHis opinion, offered after monitoring the
6 July 1966 meeting between the principal
os case officer and Nosenko, that “the way in
js which the interview was conducted would very
effectively slam shut another psychological
door."

Admittedly, the above comments come to us secondhand,
via memoranda written by others. Nonetheless, they are
consistent with everything in the psychiatrist's hand-
written reports of his visits to Nosenko in confinement. :
It will suffice here to illustrate our point with one
example, quoted from the psychiatrist's 14 July 1964 re-
port of a visit to Nosenko:

Subject was seen for [the] first time in over
two weeks. His general physical condition is
satisfactory and his weight is now 170 lbs.

There is evidence however that he is reacting
psychologically to his detention and is show-
ing increased tension, anxiety and is misin-

terpreting various stimuli in his environment.

Although the psychiatrist later changed his mind i

program. They are only partially relevant to Nosenko's
Situation, because no experimen*er in the non-Communist
world has ever attempted to impose social isolation or
other forms of deprivation on experimental subjects for
more than a few days at a tinte. (The Soviets, who are
bound by fewer restrictions than we, have employed
durations of up to 60 days.) Nevertheless, while vari-
ous researchers have obtained diverse results, there
is ample evidence that certain psychological, physiolog-
ical, and behavioral’ impairments do indeed result from
severe restrictions being: placed on physical activity,
sensory stimulation, and social interaction; and this
generalization seems to apply to Soviets in much the
Same way as it does to Americans. The psychiatrist's
judgments were not doubt based in good faith on his
clinical judgment, but the question remains as to
whether the latter was not distorted by his apparent
commitmerit to the cause of “breaking" Nosenko. Thus we

a are ied inevitably to the problem of whether such a
commitment is appropriate in the case of a doctor of
medicine.

H Cc. Conclusions

The senior author of this study spent 1972 making
a study of Soviet agents| [fwo of the conclusions
of that study are worth requoting in part four years
later:

we know that we have to call on specialists

who are normal, but unfortunately many Soviet
defectors

require very specialized handling...

missio
we must always keep in mind the possibility
of an agent's being under opposition con?"
trol, as long as there is a change that he
is genuine we should never let him become
aware of our suspicions. We have missed
some major operational opportunities by
violating this rule.

In the Nosenko case, the problem lay not in our
failure to make use of the psychologists/psychiatrists
but in out gross misuse of them. CIA officials in
charge of the Nosenke case until 1967 sought assistance
of professionals from this field, as they did from
similar people in other fields, only to help shore up
certain conceptions.

For their part, the psychologist/psychiatric
professionals were not of as much help as they could
have been. They had become accustomed over the
years to playing a subordinate support role to the
operators and had developed a "you call--we haul"
attitude that is inconsistent with the independent-
mindedness legitimately to be expected of a professional.
In addition, because of the doctrine of compartmentation,
the knowledge that the Agency's psychological/psychiatric
professionals have had to contribute has, at any given
time, been much less than it could and should have been.

CHAPTER XI

Methodology and Leadership eee

Lack of Counterintelligence Methodology

We accept without question the necessity for counter-
intelligence, as a category of the intelligence process
concerned with the activities of hostile powers' covert
and clandestine activities against the United States and
our allies. But such a discipline, if it is to fulfill
its purposes, must employ an orderly and systematic
methodology. Unhappily, in the Nosenko case it did no
such thing.

Influence of Chief, CI on Methodology

The predominant influence in the counterintelligence
field within the Agency until 1975 was the then Chief, CI.

His reputation for expertise rested on his purportedly
unique knowledge of the KGB's worldwide covert political
role. In truth, no one could compete with him as an expert
on this subject. His analysés, based on fragmentary and
often inapplicable data, were more imaginative than
systenatic and therefore neither easily comprehended nor
replicated by his interlocutors. But unlike the Emperor
and his imaginary clothes, Chief, CI's fantasies were never
vulnerable to objective examination, simply because he
surrounded such data as existed with a wall of secrecy.

His "facts" were available in full only to a minimum number
of trusted apostles; to the rest of the intelligence com-
munity, both American and foreign, he doled them out
selectively--seldom in written form--to prove whatever
point he was trying to make at the time.

Chief, CI‘'s preference for oral over written communica-
tion is worth emphasizing. During his incumbency as its
chief, the CI Staff, though it supposedly had in its
possession information concerning a horrendous hazard to

oth the United States and its allies, never committed to
paper complete ub-.

Impact of Faulty Counterintelligence on Positive Intelli-
gence Collection

There is an important interrelationship between coun-
terintelligence, as it was conducted in the 1960s, and the
collection of positive intelligence from human sources.
Only if this relationship is spelled out can the full im-
pact of the events we have been describing be comprehended.

At the time CIA was established, the primary mission
of what was later to become the Plans Directorate's
Clandestine Service was conceived to be the collection 7
of strategicully-significant intelligence from clandestine
human sources. How successful was the Clandestine Service
in fulfilling this mission?

iH Agency claims of success in the human-source col-

' lection field have often been so phrased, whether inten-
fi tionally or not, as to give the impression that our
achievenents stemmed largely from the process called
“development and recruitment." The impression that we
“recruited” our best Soviet and Warsaw Pact sources fol-
: lowing a period of orderly development nust be dispelled,

If our most significant positive intelligence and
i much of our most significant counterintelligence from 7
human sources have come from Soviet or other Warsaw Pact :
Mationals who volunteered their services, why did we

fail to systematize their handling more fully? Even more
to the point within the framework of the present study,
why would we not give such persons the benefit of every
reasonable doubt rather than treat them with suspicion
and, in the cases of Nosenko and - outright
inhumanity?

emerged from World War II, oriented toward action rather
than contemplation. Chief, CI was almost unique in his
interest in long-range analysis. Within the Clandestine
Service, his generation was in general suspicious of
theory and ill-prepared in most cases to cope with it.

On the other hand, the best of the Service's leaders
--and there were many good ones--were successful because
they possessed a difficult-to-define quality called com-
mon sense. Its value should not be underestimated. For
example, when Penkovskiy was producing strategic intelli-
gence that remains of value to this day, it was the com-
mon sense of these other leaders that led them to resist
Chief, CI's allegation that Penkovskiy was a “disinforma-
tion agent." :

Nevertheless, senior Clandestine Service supervisors
of the period 1948-1970 had seldom themselves been trained
in rigorous analytic techniques, and thus they s«ldom
were in 2 position to demand high standards of analysis
of their subordinates. Until the massive outflow of
retirees in recent years changed the demography of the
Service, most senior operational supervisors had received
their higher educations before systematized analysis be-
came routine even in such "soft" subjects as political
science (for which a knowledge of inferential statistics
is now required at most universities). Many, probably
most, of these same gentlemen were also educated during a
sort of interregnum in academe, when the study of classical
logic had passed from vogue but had not yet been replaced
by emphasis on scientific method. In the realm of
technology, almost all senior executives in the Clandestine
Service before 1970 had finished college before the first
digital computer, an invaluable analytical tool, became
commercially available about 1951.

There also have been, of course, a number of bright
spots. Some of the Plans Directorate's divisions and
staffs had subordinate components that specialized in sub-
stantive intelligence and built up great expertise on
specific subjects over the years. From time to time
there were also bursts of enthusiasm for the use of
psychological evaluation techniques in the assessment
of prospective agents. But these cases were exceptions;
primary reliance within the Clandestine Service was on.
judgments that, though sometimes ‘bolstered by impressive
figures and arcane terminology, were nevertheless essentially
intuitive and non-systematic. .

Such systems and criteria as did exist were
largely in the heads of various individuals, ana there
is no evidence of any appreciable long-term consensus
among the latter. Every defector case tended to be
subject to the vagaries of the momentary line-up of
CIA leadership. The existence of an Interagency
Defector Committee, subordinate to the DDP, introduced

limited for the most part to superficial administrative
and procedural formalities.

Summary

If we seem to have wandered far afield from the
nature and validity of methodology of previous Nosenko
bona fides studies, we have done so because the unfortunate
handling of Nosenko was not an isolated event. . Rather,
it was symptomatic ot some fundamental inadequacies of the
Plans Directorate. What this means to us is that the
long-needed improvement in our conduct of counterintelli-
gence activity, now well underway, must be carried on
within the framework of a searching reexamination of the
analytical techniques employed by the Directorate and its
Clandestine Service.

Whatever the course taken, however, we believe that
the last quarter of this century is going to be even more
exigent, though in a different way, than the past twenty-
five years. We therefore sum up the implications of this
chapter by posing a single question: How can we ensure
that the upcoming generation of Clandestine Service leaders
is better prepared intellectually to meet the challenges
that face them than were those who ran the Service in
the sixties? ’

CHAPTER XIT

Conclusions and Recommendations

The Letter of Instructions

General guidance for the preparation of this report
was contained in a Letter of Instructions, signed by the
Deputy Director for Operations on 8 June 1976. it as-
signed the following tasks:

You are tasked to write an analysis of the
Nosenko case which will address the following
matters:

{1]. The bona fides of Nosenko.

[2]. The value of Nosenko to
the United States and allied govern-
ments.

[3]. The relationship and
significance of Nosenko to other
agents and operations.

[4]. The identification of unex-
ploited Nosenko penetration leads and
information.

[5]. The nature and validity of
methodology of previous Nosenko bona
fides studies.

We have interpreted the above responsibilities rather
liberally, because the ramifications and implications of
the Nosenko case have proven more far-reaching than we,
and probably the framers of the above letter, anticipated.
Nonetheless, we shall commence this concluding chapter
with responses to the matters covered in sub-paragraphs
a. through e.

-1. Bona Fides

Doubts regarding Nosenko's bona fides were of
our own making. Had the job of initially assessing

him as a person, as well as of gathering and evaluating

the intelligence he had to offer, been handled

properly, he could have been declared a bona fide
defector as readily as have many other Soviet in-
telligence officers.

This is not to say that we can be certain of
the genuineness of any defector. It will always
remain hypothetically possible that the Soviet
government , acting through the KGB or some other

nstrumentality, will attempt to plant an intended
“disinformation agent" or prospective penetration
of our government on our doorstep. But the useful-
ness of the Soviets’ doing so, in the manner as-
cribed to them in the Nosenko case, is probably as
Slight. as is the feasibility. Soviet success in
using native-born citizens of other countries to
spy on their own homelands has been considerable.
By contrast, there is no record of the USSR's suc-
cesfully infiltrating the government of a major
non-Communist power by use of an acknowledged
Soviet citizen, least of all one whose career has
been spent in a Soviet intelligence or security
service.

We therefore conclude that Nosenko was from
the beginning a bona fide defector.

2. Value of Nosenko

Nosenko's contribution has been summarized in
Chapter IV. He has been of great value, but he
probably could have been even more valuable had he

een properly handled.

3. Relationship to Other Agents and Operations

As was made clear in Chapters X and XI, the
Nosenko case, through no fault of the defector him-
self, had a most unfortunate effect on all clandestine
operations in the Soviet field.

4, Identification of Unexploited Leads

We have not felt that this subject was one we
could feasibly or properly investigate. To do so
would have meant delving into the past and current
operations of both the SE Division and the CI Staff
to ascertain the extent. to which there might have

been "exploitation" of any of the|
persons whom Nosenko identified by name. Time
would not have permitted us to accomplish this
task, nor would our doing so have been consistent
with the principle of compartmentation.

i 5. Methodology

It has been made clear in Chapter XI that the
variety of techniques used in handling Nosenko did
not conform to any generally accepted sense of the
term "methodology."

B. Recommended Action

Most of our recommendations for action have been j
7 previously stated or implied. In the following para- z
graphs, we recapitulate them, with such supplementary

remarks as seem necessary.

1. Examination of the Role of Professionals

We recommend that the role that can properly be
played within the Agency by members of the organized
professions--medicine, psychiatry, psychology, law,
and others--be given careful study, within the con-
text of (a) ensuring that the Agency puts their skills

H . to the best possible use, and (b) refraining from in-
Jee volving them in matters not properly within their
professional purview.

2. Improvement of Intellectual Standards

We recommend that the Operations Directorate,

i E and its Clandestine Service, take whatever steps

are possible to ensure that the intellectual caliber
rit their personnel is equal to the exigencies of the
future,

We realize that the present personnel selection
system sets high standards for those entering on
duty at the professional level, particularly as
regards IQ and education. But the standards presently
7 in force do not by themselves guarantee that future
: selections will possess independence of mind, analytical
ability, and objectivity.

In the case of personnel already on board,
it should be kept in mind that we live in a
rapidly-evolving, technologically-oriented
civilization. Knowledge and intellectual
skills adequate at this time may be inadequate
a few years from now. For an intelligence or-
ganization, we define "inadequate" as anything
that is less than the best.

We suggest that a board of expert consultants
be established, drawn primarily from research in-
stitutions, high-technology enterprises, and the
academic world to recommend a program of screening
new entrants and improving the analytical skills
of those already on duty, with the aim of achiev-
ing and maintaining a high level of intellectual
excellence throughout the Operations Directorate.

3. Detection of Deception

We recommend that high priority be accorded a
program to develop new methods of detecting deception.

Specific criteria of bona fides will follow
naturally from improved methods of detecting deception.

“We would thus substantially reduce the threat that
the employment of unstable or anti-social personalities
poses for the Agency, and particularly for the
Operations Directorate.

Psychological Assessment of Agents and Defectors

Although few, if any, of the Soviet or Soviet
Bloc agents to whom we have had direct and continuing
access have ever been tested as long as they remained
in agent status, we do not accept as valid the. reasons
usually given for not testing then.

Implementation of this recommendation would,
if the other programs above-recommended are also car-
ried out, contribute substantially toward authentica-
tion of agent sources and information. °
