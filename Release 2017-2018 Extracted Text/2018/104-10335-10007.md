Dear John: ee

Barry Harrelson has asked that we request in writing your assistance in helping us
obtain access to records from the Intelligence Community Staff for the period from June
1963 through December 1964. Although our ultimate interest will be determining
whether there are any assassination records included among ICS holdings, we would at
this time appreciate obtaining a more general idea of its indices and holdings,
particularly with respect to: (a) identifiable assassination records; (b) staff activities
during the month following the assassination, (c) Cuba, (d) Mexico, and (e) the Soviet
Union.

We would be pleased to discuss with you ways in which we might better refine this
request.

Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
