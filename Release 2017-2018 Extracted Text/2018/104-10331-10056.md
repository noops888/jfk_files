Re:

CIvil Action No. 94-1909;

Keenan In pent of vuation et alie

Dear KIrsten:

The CIA has, through you,

suggested that it uight conduct

additlonal searches for records pertaining

to my client,

Intrance P. Reenari, 11 li. Keenan furnished additional Intorntion

which enabled it to conduct such searcher.

Although Me. Keenan be

lieves that the intormation which he initially funished the co

was sufficient to have located sone records pertaining to him, he

Is providing the following additional information in hopes that the

CIA vill now be able to locate responsive records.

It. Reenan states that on or about June 1951, he completod a

series of cIA application foms for employment.

At that time,

resided. In the 1600 bloar of connectiont Avenue, N-W.

Nt.. Keenan

was encouraged to monit these applications by two Ch women en

ployees who resided at the same location.

After Reenan completed these applications, he was interviewed

at Length as a prospective at mployee. At the conclusion of the

interviews, Keenan and the CIA officat who condueted the interview

were unable to reach agreement on a starting salary, as the clas

offer was too low for Keenan.

Basad on the CIA' interest in

Keenan us a prospective mployee, it in clear that at a minimum t

should have a 201, file on Keenan.

For six years Reenan was an FBI Supervimor.

For sir and a

half yoars he was Forelgn Ansistance Inspector in Southeast Asia.

Diring these periods he had frequent contact with CIA representa-

tives in investigative matters of mutual interest.

Because o1

this, there should be nunrous references to Reenan lu CIa Ille.

As an FBI supervisor, Keenan played a role in the fat's laver

tigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This

In evidenced by the following documents:
