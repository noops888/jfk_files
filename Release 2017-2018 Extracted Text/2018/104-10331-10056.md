Re: Civil Action No. 94-1909; ers
Keenan v. Denk. of Justice, et al, 7

Dear Kireten:

The CIA has, through you, suqgasted that it might conduct
additional searches for records pertaining to my client, Mr.
Laurence P. Keenan, if Mx. Keenan furnished additional information
which enabled it to conduct such searchag. Although Mr. Keenan be-
lieves that the information which he initially furnished the rd
was sufficient to have located some records pertaining to hin, he
is providing the following additional information in hopes that the
Cra will now be able to locate responsive redords.

Mx. Keenan states that on or about June 1951, he completed = a
series of CIA application forms for employment. At that time, he
resided in the 1600 bloak ef Connecticut Avenue, N.W. Mr. Keenan
was encouraged to submit these applications by two CIA women en~
Ployees whe resided at the same location.

After Keenan completed these applications, he was interviewed
at length as a prospective CIA employee. At the conclusion of the
interviews, Keenan and the CIA officar who conducted the interview
were unable to reach agreement: on a starting Salary, aa the CIA’s
offer was too low fer Keenan. Based on the CIA’s interest in
Keenan as a prospective employee, it is clear that at a minimum, it
should have a 201:.file on Keenan.

For six years Keenan was an FBI Supervisor. For six and a
half years he was Foreign Assistance Inspector in Southeast Asia.
During these periods he had frequent contact with CIA representa—
tives in investigative matters of mutual interest. Because of

this, there should be numerous references to Keenan in CIA files...

As an FRI supervisor, Keenan played a role in the FBI‘s inves—
tigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This
is evidenced by the following documents:
