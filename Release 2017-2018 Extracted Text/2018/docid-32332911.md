DETAILS:
A. PERSONAL HISTORY. AND BACKGROUND

1) Birth Data :

PG T-1, who requested his identity remain confidential and

who stated he will not testify at any future Federal or state
proceedings, advised that SEBASTIAN LA ROCCA,: the son of
IGNAZIO and ROSARIA SCANCARELLO,.was born at Villa Rosa, Italy,
on December 19, 1901, and that he departed from Villa Rosa
prior to 1927, the year in which the registration of the
inhabitants of that community was begun.

2 Citizenship Status

According to the files maintained by the Pittsburgh Office
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Pittsburgh,
Pa., aS made available to SA WILLIAM R. WALL on December 12,
1957, by HAROLD LAUVER, Supervisory Ifivestigator, LA ROCCA*
entered the United States on September 2, 1910, at New York
City, N.Y., aboard the "Principe De Piemonte."

These same Immigration and Naturalization Service records show
that on May 12, 1950, LA ROCCA applied for United States citizen-
ship. On January 20, 1953, a deportation warrant was'issued

for LA ROCCA by the District Director, Immigration and Natural-
ization Service, Philadelphia, Pa.; said warrant was based on
Sections 2hai(a)(4) and 212(a)(12) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act. He was arrested January 21, 1953, and subse-
quently given a deportation hearing as an undesirable alien.
This undesirable status was based on previous arrests involving
LA ROCCA on criminal-type charges. On August 31, 1953, LA ROCCA
testified before an Immigration and Naturalization Service
Hearing Board that he had been involved in the numbers racket,
bootlegging, and slot machines, but added that he was no longer
involved in anything other than legitimate enterprises. The
"Pittsburgh Press," a~Pittsburgh daily newspaper, publicized
portions of LA ROCCA's testimony on November 10, 1954, and
reported that LA ROCCA had testified that his financial holdings
amounted to approximately one-quarter of a million dollars and
if permitted to remain in the United States, LA ROCCA testified,
he would not become a burden of the state.

The "Pittsburgh Press" of August 6, 1959, carried an article
entitled "LaRocca Ends Battle for Citizenship." It stated
that "Pittsburgh racketeer John LaRocca has decided he
doesn't want to be an American citizen after all." It told
how his attorney, VINCENT CASEY, filed two petitions in Federal
Court at Pittsburgh on August 5, 1959. One asked the court to
stay action by the Immigration and Naturalization Service

on LA ROCCA's nine-year-old petition for citizenship and

the other asked that the application be thrown out completely.
The article said that the Government did not want to

let the matter drop so quietly and contended that LA ROCCA

had to go through with the hearings anyway and show why he
changed his mind. The hearing was postponed until the Judge
could rule on the legal points raised by both sides.

ticle said that MR. CASEY explained that LA ROCCA
wanted to withdraw his application to save himself further

trouble with authorities and said LA ROCCA has been "harassed
enough."

NED HEIMOVITZ , Naturalization Examiner, Immigration and

ust 11, 1959, a stipulation was entered into by the Immigra-

e with Attorney VINCENT CASEY
igh provided that LA ROCCA's Petition for Naturalization
wuld be withdrawn with the provision that a new petition would
SNGt de filed in any court for a continuous period of five years.
He Stated that this matter is contained in

Immigration and

zt smiss Petition for Naturalization for John S. LaRocca."

rther stated that the order of the United States District
Court at Pittsburgh is dated August 11, 1959.

3) Education

PG T-l,advised that it was not possible to ascertain whether

or not LA ROCCA received: any formal schooling during the time
that he was in Italy.

On February 13, 1958, FLOYD 0. SMITH, Supervising Principal,
and THOMAS J, ADDLEMAN, High School Principal, both of Shannock
Valley Joint School District, which includes Yatesboro, Pa.,
where LA ROCCA formerly resided, advised that the Old Yatesboro
School had been abandoned and that records of attendance were
not available for students who attended from thirty to forty

years ago. Both advised that although they had been residents
of Rural Valley-Yatesboro area for forty or more years, they
could not recall the LA ROCCA family.

On March 10, 1958, MISS EVELYN LEDERER, Clerk, City Court,
Dunkirk, N.Y., advised that her records reflected that on
December 17, 1930, one CARL STEIN, Manager of the J. G,. Pickard
Store, Dunkirk, N.Y., obtained-a warrant for the arrest of

JOHN LA ROCCA for disposing of chattel mortgaged property.

She stated that on November 5, 1931, LA ROCCA appeared in

court and paid STEIN $115 for the property originally purchased
and the charge was dismissed. She advised that the J. G. Pickard
Company went out of business approximately fifteen years ago

and that CARL STEIN is deceased.

PG T-3, who requested his identity remain confidential and who
stated he will not testify at any future Federal or state
proceedings, advised that the "top men" in Pittsburgh rackets
met in the dining room of the Genovese Cocktail Lounge, now
called the Red Eagle Club, 412 Larimer Avenue, Pittsburgh, where

they hold general discussions. PG T-3 was of the opinion that

JOHN LA ROCCA held the controlling interest in this club,

although it was operated by MIKE GENOVESE and his brother,

PHIL GENOVESE. PG T-3 stated that during the meetings of the

various individuals at the club, JOHN LA ROCCA was definitely

the "big man" in the group and was looked up to by all other

men in attendance. PG T-3 stated that all orders came from

LA ROCCA unless SAMUEL MANNARINO was present, in which case SAM
MANNARINO, at times took precedence over LA ROCCA since he was
considered by many as the chief racketeer in the Western j
Pennsylvania area ai that JOHN LA ROCCA was immediately next to
MANNARINO. PG T-3 added that it was obvious that MIKE GENOVESE

was next in line after LA ROCCA and was often considered being f
groomed for LA ROCCA's position with all of his holdings and
responsibilities.

BD. CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

A Criminal Intelligence Report furnished by Detective JOHN
CHRIN, Pennsylvania State Police, Greensburg,: Pa., dated
October 14, 1942, set out that IGNACIO CASTAGLIA and JOHN
MICALE operated a pinball machine business under the name
of the Fayette Novelty and Vending Machine Company, The
office of this business was on East Pittsburgh Street,
Connellsville, Pa, CHRIN advised-that this company was
controlled by LA ROCCA. In addition, according to CHRIN,

LA ROCCA had a company named the Rock-O-Lai Juke Box Company
which had music toxes in most of the roadhouses throughout
Fayette County, Pa. This business was believed by CHRIN

to be controlled by MICALE, CASTAGLIA and LA ROCCA. CHRIN
stated that on August 3, 1942, at about 2:50 PM, a shooting
took place on East Pittsburgh Street, ‘Connellsville, between
MICALE.and LA ROCCA, MICALE fired a shotgun blast at |

LA ROCCA and missed, CHRIN believed that this was because
of an argument that had ensued as a result of LA ROCCA's i
making an effort to place machines in the county without the
consent of CASTAGLIA and MICALE,

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE MESSER advised SA ROBERT A.
VOEGE that he had been in the numbers writing activity since
about 1928 and was still active in this regard. He said that
most of Pittsburgh's present day "big racket mien" once
depended on him solely for protection purposes since he
knew local and state police figures and recalled that JOHN
LA ROCCA was one. of these racketeers. MESSER stated that
LA ROCCA became acquainted with him in about 1941 or 1942
when LA ROCCA was handling ail the numbers activity in

the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself
up as a "little God." When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied
with his financial gains, he left Pittsburgh on a trip to
Chicago to see friends about paste reel machines with which
he felt he could make more money. MESSER said a paste reel

‘was similar to a “one-armed bandit" with the exception that

a small paper-wrapped mint was dispensed after the coin was
placed in the slot. and the play was registered. The Chicago
manufacturer of this machine circumvented the "strictly

for gambling purposes" phraseology in the law in this manner.

While LA ROCCA was in Chicago, MESSER said he moved into the
East Liberty section and took over the entire numbers
operation. He turned in his numbers returns to one GEORGE
CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When LA ROCCA returned

7

PG 92-226

to Pittsburgh he became angry with MESSER and his move and
had someone drive a car over MESSER one night as he was
crossing a street. MESSER said when he was discharged
from the hospital he found out that his automobile had
numerous bullet holes in it. MESSER said that because he
thought he would make money in the East Liberty section,
he stayed in the business of writing numbers and actually
forced LA ROCCA out of the numbers business,

MESSER advised that in about 1943, he and LA ROCCA became
friendly and LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in ‘the
ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company

which later set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard in
Pittsburgh. MESSER recalled that LA ROCCA was completely
bankrupt at that time because of numbers setbacks. but
managed to raise enough money to put up his share. MESSER
said he personally travelled to Chicago to arrange for the
purchase of machines to be distributed by this company and
had a verbal agreement with ART ROONEY who allowed him to .
Place these machines throughout the East Liberty, Homewood
and Garfield sections of Pittsburgh where ROONEY was not
operating. According to MESSER, ROONEY, who was the present
owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, professional football club,
was the only man who could get paste reels before LA ROCCA
tried, and controlled the entire Pittsburgh vicinity in

this regard. MESSER said that the Goverrment placed a $100
tax stamp on each machine;.and the City of Pittsburgh put a
$50 tax stamp on each machine. He said that other owners of
that company, in addition to himself and LA ROCCA, were
FRANK AMATO, BARNEY McGINLEY, SAMUEL MANNARINO and F. W.
ZOGG, the latter from Chicago.

On August 31, 1953, LA ROCCA, while testifying at an
Immigration and Naturalization Service hearing in his own
behalf, stated he had been "mixed up" in bootlegging,
numbers racket, and slot machines, and that in his earlier
days he had worked as an Indiana County, Pa., coal miner.
LA ROCCA stated that he was then engaged only in net eamake
enterprises.

E, LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISES
