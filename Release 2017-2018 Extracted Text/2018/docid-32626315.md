Possible U.S. Strategy Toward France

French Approach

A review of DeGaulle's press conference statements following the test

ban provides some indication of possible French reaction and also opportu

nities for U.s. policy.

First, DeGaulle objected to the test ban treaty

because it did not limit

the further manufacturex of delivery vehicles.

"It is a fact that they both have the means to

annihilate the

universe and it is a fact that there is no question of their

renouncing

such means."

"In these circumstances, then, since the world situation has

not changed in the slightest with respect to this threat, it

is perfectly natural that a country like France, which is

beginning to obtain the means of freeing itself to some

degree from this permanent terror, should employ them, the

more so since there is nothing to prevent the two rivals,

after their tests have been terminated, from continuing

to manufacture more and more numerous and more and more

powerful projectiles and providing themselves with launch-

ing vehicles, rockets, planes, submarines, and satellites

perfected to an ever-increasing degree."

Second, France proposed a conference of the nuclear powers to pose

"practical" measures covering nuclear delivery vehicles.

"However, in any case and at all odds, France would be prepared

when that vain pretense is ended - 1

am speaking of the Geneva

Conference = to propose to the three other atomic powers certain

effective and practical disarmament measures concerning, in parti-

air and maritime space vehicles for launching nuclear

missiles. What occurred in Moscow merely confirms France's

intention, and it intends, before the end of this year, to

invite all the States concerned to study this essential problem

together with France before it may become insoluble in its turn."

If the U.S. Government chooses to support proposal freezing nuclear

free levels, we could increase the possibility of French participation,

(1) By offering to supply the French with a small but limited number.

of nuclear delivery vehicles and warheads, contingent upon their parti

cipation in this treaty and the test ban.

(2) If private discussions with the Soviet Union indicated a likel i-

hood that an agreement could be negotiated, we should attempt to arrange

to hold the meetings in Paris, under DeGaulle's sponsorship, and refer

to any treaty as "The Treaty of Paris"'. In private we must

make clear

our terms to the British and DeGaulle so that the USSR cannot use such

negotiations to further divide the Alliance.

If accepted by the Soviet Union, this proposal would either deeply

divide us from France, or once again establish a common French

and U.s.

nuclear policy.
