STATUS REPORT

Synopsis:

NORMAN reported that Melvin KANTOR, born 1937, whose >
eryptonym is "KARP," and who was a student at Harvard University
and who had distant relatives in the Soviet Union, was, in 1961, re-
ported by Eugene NOSKOV as having been recruited on ideological
grounds, Vladimir Vladimirovich IVANOV handled this case which
was turned over to the First Chief Directorate. NORMAN admitted
that NOSKOV could have been mistaken on the date as NOSKOV did
not have first hand knowledge of the matter.

Marvin KANTOR, a professor at Northwestern University,
born 9 May 1934 at New York City, New York, was a student at the
University of Copenhagen from 1957 - 1961. He visited his uncle
in Minsk, USSR in 1958 and 1959 and admitted to a CIA officer in
1961 extensive contacts and cooperation with Soviet officials in
Copenhagen, Denmark and in Minsk, USSR. He also recounted a clear
recruitment attempt by one Evegeniy KAN in Minsk in 1959 which he
allegedly refused,- Yet he continued contacts with Soviets in Copen-
hagen through April 1961. He has made additional visits to the Soviet
Union in 1965, 1969 and 1970. He has repeatedly denied any contacts
in the United States, or abroad, by Soviet Intelligence since 1961.



Background:

Marvin KANTOR was born on 9 May 1934 in New York City,
New York, of Russian born naturalized parents, Irving and Sarah ra
(BRODSKY) KANTOR, Marvin KANTOR served in the U. S. Marine
Corps from February 1953 to August 1955, attaining the rank of ~
Corporal (aviation mechanic ) and remained in the USMC Reserve
until 1963.

KANTOR attended the following schools: DeWitt Clinton
High School, Bronx, New York, graduated 1952; Fairleigh Dickinson
University, New Jersey, 1956-1957 as a night student; University of
Copenhagen, Denmark, September 1957 - June 1961; Fordham Uni-
versity, Bronx, New York, September 1961 - August 1962, M.A.
degree; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, September
1962, working for Ph. D, and employed as a lecturer in Slavic
languages.

KANTOR visited the Soviet Union on the following occasions

May - July 1958 Minsk, 3 days in Moscow
June - Sept 1959 Minsk, 2 days in Moscow
August 1965 Moscow, Study-Tour Group
Mar - Apr 1969 Moscow, Study A
Mar - Apr - 1970 Moscow, Leningrad - researchin;

KANTOR, upon receiving M.A. degree at Fordham University
in 1962, attended the University of Michigan where he studied for a
Ph. D. and was employed as a lecturer in Slavic languages. He was
still affiliated with the University of Michigan when he accompanied the
tour group of students to the Soviet Union in 1965. In June 1966, after
KANTOR's return from a years study in Europe, he indicated he would
begin employment as an instructor at Brooklyn College. By 1969
KANTOR was employed in the Russian Language Department at North-
western University, Evanston, Illinois.

In 1969, KANTOR advised the FBI that at no time since his
return to the United States in 1969, and also after his visit to the
Soviet Union in 1965, have any Soviet personnel contacted him other
than the communications he has had with his relatives in Minsk. He
stated that he feels the Soviet Intelligence Service has just forgotten
about him.



| “SECRET:

Information From NORMAN:

NORMAN was given three pages of his notes, on 28 November
1967, and was requested to translate the notes and give an explanation
of how he obtained the information. NORMAN furnished the following

_ in response to this request:

“The recruitments of the 1st Section, 7th Depart-
ment, 2nd Chief Directory in 1960-1962, reported to
me by a senior case officer of the 1st Section, NOSKOV,
Evgeni, who, during the absence of the chief of the 1st
Section, DERA, temporarily acted as Chief of Section...

“ 4'Karp' - KANTOR Melvin, born in 1937,.a
citizen of the USA, student at Harvard University, has
far relatives in Russia, recruited on a loyal basis.
Against him worked a senior case officer (later chief
of Section), IVANOV, Vladimir. The file was given to
the lst Chief Directory."

On 9 May 1968, the FBI furnished a translation of available notes
of NORMAN, A report on “Recruitment of Foreigners by the personnel
of the 1st Section" contained the following:

"1961 - 6 'Karl' - Melvin CANTOR, born 1937,
Harvard University student; has distant relatives in the
USSR. Recruited on loyalty basis (case) transferred to
PGU."

On 27 July 1968, NORMAN was requested to consider carefully
several cases on NORMAN's list of “recruitments of the First Section
of the Seventh Department in 1960-1962 reported by NOSKOV." NOR-
MAN was asked if there could be any cases on this list which were in
1959. NORMAN replied that there could be 1959 cases included; that
NOSKOV could be mistaken; that the list was not important as to when
the recruitment took place. For NORMAN, who was preparing the re-
port for BOBKOV, it was merely who were recruited (agents) during
the entire period. NOSKOV could have made some mistakes because
he was asking officers in the absence of the Chief of Section. Some of
these officers perhaps did not remember or just knew a little bit, such
as a file being given to the First Chief Directory. It was concluded pos-
sible, therefore, that there could be a 1959 case in this list.

” SeeR ER

At this point, the case of Melvin KANTOR was referred to and
NORMAN was asked if he was reading that as Melvin KANTOR. NOR-
MAN was told there was a case on an individual by the name of Marvin
KANTOR. NORMAN stated, "If he is the same, 30... was born in
‘37, and was a student in Harvard, was studying, it's possible he...
because, you know there wasn't file and there isn't place where he can
check," NORMAN affirmed that there wasn't a file to look at to get the
information on KANTOR,. He stated, ‘He (NOSKOV) has written him-
self ‘given in First Chief Directory.' That's why he could make mis-
take. "

NORMAN was asked if he thought the recruitment of "KARP"
was made by Vladimir IVANOV, NORMAN replied that it was possibly
IVANOV but NORMAN did not know. NORMAN denied, however, that
it could possibly have been Yevgeniy NOSKOV who recruited "KARP"
because NOSKOV could then have written something definite without
mistakes. NOSKOV wrote too little on this case. This made NORMAN
think that NOSKOV was. not directly involved in the "KARP" recruitment.

yet

During an interview of NORMAN, on 27 and 31 January 1969,
concerning Melvin KANTOR, NORMAN was advised information had
been received that KANTOR brought a bottle of wiskey and some other
articles to a Soviet correspondent in Moscow named SHARIF at the re-
quest of an official of the Soviet Embassy, Copenhagen, Denmark, where
KANTOR was a university student; and, at SHARIF's request, KANTOR wrote
an article for which SHARIF paid him and KANTOR was required to give
SHARIF a receipt for the money. NORMAN identified SHARIF as an agent
of Vladimir IVANOV of the Seventh Department, SCD, KGB, and source
expressed the opinion, “It was combination of IVANOV and Seventh De-
partment that KANTOR had come to write a short article of his impres-
sions of Minsk - (and SHARIF) had given him 5,000 rubles - it was
KGB's combination" because SHARIF "cannot do this ,- .any corres-
pondent cannot do this thing - and SHARIF was an agent." NORMAN
indicated that the money given by SHARIF to KANTOR undoubtedly was
KGB money, and it was the KGB which insisted that SHARIF obtain a re-
ceipt from KANTOR,

Among handwritten comments NORMAN furnished while review-
ing photographs and names of numerous Soviets who had been in the
United States, are the following comments concerning Dzhavad Azizovich
SHARIF:

October 2, 1969: "SHARIF, D, A. - an agent of
7th Department, SCD, KGB; in 1959 there were a
number of signals (indications) that he was studied
by American Intelligence for recruitment. SCD,
KGB was planning to make an operative game on this
basis."

November 7, 1969: “SHARIF, D,A. - a corres- Bs
pondent; an agent of the 7th Department, SCD, KGB;
in 1959 SCD, KGB was hoping that he would be re-
cruited by CIA,"

Among handwritten comments NORMAN furnished concerning KGB

or specific names to refresh his recollection, is the following:

“SHABAD - acorrespondent, an agent of the 7th
Department, 2nd Chief Directory; in 1959 were signals
that the American Intelligence studied him .- at the end
of 1959 he was in the USA with KHRUSHCHEV's group -
SHABAD was instructed if (there) would be approachment
to transfer a conversation in Moscow - but there was
not made an approachment to him in the USA in 1959."

NORMAN subsequently indicated he confused the name of Theodore

SHABAD, an American correspondent, with Soviet correspondent, SHARIF,

On 27 January 1969, NORMAN furnished information to repre-

sentatives of the FBI which has been reported as follows:

(NORMAN) recalled that KANTOR was recruited
by the KGB in the USSR in 1959. He was recruited by
representatives of the 7th Department, Second Chief
Directorate while traveling as a tourist in the USSR.
(NORMAN) recalled that Vladimir Vladimirovich
IVANOV, a KGB officer, was operating an agent who
was a correspondent named Dzhavad Azizovich
SHARIF, This correspondent was placed in contact aoe ee
with KANTOR and, on behalf of KGB, induced KAN-
TOR to write his impressions of Minsk. (NORMAN)
stated that SHARIF would not have done this on his

own initiative. KANTOR was given 500 rubles and
signed a receipt which the KGB intended to use for
blackmail purposes at a later date. (KGB would in-
dicate that the money was given by the KGB rather
than by a newspaper correspondent. )

"In addition, for blackmail purposes, KGB was
planning to place Vladimir Arsentyevich GRUSHA in
contact with KANTOR, GRUSHA was a KGB officer
who had been expelled from the United States as per-
sona non grata. KGB planned to photograph him with
KANTOR and use the photograph to support a conten-
tion that KANTOR was in contact with the KGB.
Source did not know if this plan was actually carried
out.

“Source believed that IVANOV had contact with
KANTOR and was involved in the recruitment of
KANTOR, but, of course, was not alone in the ap-
proach,

“Source stated that the Seventh Department did
not have any information from the First Chief
Directorate (FCD) regarding KANTOR but began
study of him on its own initiative.

"When advised of the Soviet refusal of a visa
for KANTOR in 1961, Source stated this may have
been done on the instructions of KGB to avoid attract-
ing American Intelligence Service (AIS) attention to
KANTOR. Another trip to the USSR might appear
suspicious to AIS," A

On 31 January 1969, NORMAN provided information to repre-
sentatives of the FBI which has been reported as follows:

"On January 31, 1969, the Source, in response
to questions, stated that he knew GRUSHA was to be
used in one of the cases handled by IVANOV but he
was not sure that this was the KANTOR case and he
might have been mistaken when he reported this on
January 27, 1969. He stated KGB "had a good thing"

against KANTOR in the form of a receipt for money
paid to him and they could claim it was given by KGB.

“Source was advised that KANTOR reportedly de-
livered gifts to SHARIF at the request of a Soviet con-
tact in Copenhagen, Boris KHRYACHKOV, who was
assigned to the Soviet Embassy. Source commented
that FCD, recognizing that KANTOR could possibly be
recruited, arranged for SCDto select an agent (SHARIF)
to whom KANTOR could be sent to facilitate his assess-
ment and recruitment. In the event the recruitment
was successful, the SCD would inform FCD which in
turn would inform the Residentura in Copenhagen."

CIA Operational Debriefing of KANTOR, April - May 1961:

Under pretext of an inquiry connected with a survey of American
scholars and graduate students engaged in Slavic studies in Scandinavian
universities, KANTOR was interviewed by a CIA officer on 11 and 12
April 1961.

Although KANTOR was first interviewed under selected academic
cover, as the discussion reached the point of his contacts with Soviet
citizens and officials in USSR in 1958 and 1959, he was informed of
American Intelligence interest. KANTOR was interviewed in depth from
1500 to 2030 and then at dinner in a restaurant until 2330. The next day
KANTOR ascertained the interviewer's bona-fides without divulging in-
telligence connection and met again at 1500 as directed. The second de-
briefing lasted 4 hours.

KANTOR provided information that he had been in the USSR
twice, in 1958 and 1959, for protracted visits with his uncle in Minsk;
that he had been in contact with Soviet Embassy officials and RIS repre-
sentatives, both in Copenhagen and Minsk, since fall 1957 until February.
1961; that he had been subject to a RIS recruitment attempt in Minsk in
summer 1959, which he allegedly refused; and that he still planned to
visit his relatives in Minsk, in May or June, before returning to the
United States in September.

KANTOR was instructed by American Intelligence to proceed
with his application for a Soviet visa, make no effort to revive his semi-

dormant contact with his last RIS contact in Copenhagen, and to re-
port the outcome of his visit to the Soviet consular officials. "ge

KANTOR stated that he had been in the USSR twice, both times. one
a visitor's visa issued to him for stays with his uncle in Minsk, He was
on the first trip from end of May till middle of July, 1958. His first
visa was issued for one month and he renewed it for an additional period
of two weeks at the Minsk OVIR, He returned via Moscow by plane
directly to Copenhagen, but spent 2-3 days in Moscow. Otherwise he‘
was in Minsk all the time.

His second trip to the USSR lasted from 2 June 1959 to 8 Septem-
ber 1959, Except for the days, 6 and 7 September, which KANTOR spent
in Moscow obtaining valid Polish and East German transit visas, he
stayed in Minsk all the time, about 3 months,

KANTOR visited his parents in New York from November 1958
to January 1959. In the summer of 1960, he traveled with his mother,
by car, from LeHarve to Berlin when she went to the USSR to visit her
brother. i

KANTOR related that he was befriended by Boris Fedorovich
KHRYACHKOV, a Soviet diplomatic official in Copenhagen in 1957 and
1958, In Minsk, KANTOR was contacted on several occasions by a.man
from a “Ministry, Viktor Ivanovich SAZONOV, who, on their second
or third meeting, offered KANTOR 500 rubles to buy a gift for KANTOR's
aunt. KANTOR refused this money. SAZONOV urged KANTOR to take
an active part in the “peace struggle" and to "cooperate" but made no
specific proposals or suggestions. KANTOR claimed that he was listen-
ing to SAZONOV and nodding moreor less his assent to the idea that peace
is better than war, that atomic weapons should not be used, etc., etc.
KANTOR admitted that SAZONOV could well have concluded, on the basis
of their conversations, that KANTOR was more or less a sympathizer.
KANTOR stated that he guessed what SAZONOV was after, but since
KANTOR did not give out any information and agreed with SAZONOV's
general idea only passively, KANTOR did not think that their meetings
were of great significance. KANTOR also stated that one request by
SAZONOV was outright foolish; namely, that KANTOR could help the
“peaceful forces" by signaling to them a threat of war from the West
(early warning!). The term intelligence was never mentioned during
KANTOR's stay in Minsk and he left in July without having accepted
any instructions or assignments from SAZONOV,



KANTOR further related that he met KHRYACHKOV again at
the Embassy in September 1958 and stated he wanted to return to
Minsk for the whole summer of 1959 because he had enjoyed his stay
very much. KHRYACHKOV promised to help him get a visa. After
KANTOR's return from a visit to his family in the United States, he
again went to the Embassy and contacted KHRYACHKOV regarding
his visa, In February 1959, KHRYACHKOV initiated the beginning
of an obviously clandestine meeting system away from the Embassy
and KHRYACHKOV's home. From February to May 1959 they met
several times on street corners and cheap eating places. KANTOR was
requested to tell whatever he knew about friends and student acquaintances
in Copenhagen, the specific requirements for admission at the university,
the organization "Clarte'" and other information not bearing upon KAN-~.-,
TOR's visa application. KANTOR reluctantly admitted that he submitted &
four or five written "statements" in his own handwriting to KHRYACHKOV i
during this period. KANTOR also admitted supplying the following names :
of American students who were in Copenhagen at that time: Murry
BROWN; David BRIAR; Peter LENNEHAN; Raymond KEA, a Negro.
student; and Don COMERFORD, KHRYACHKOV evidenced interest in
Noel FOX and Daniel MIKELSON, editors of the "Scandinavian Times"
and Rembert Craven ALLEY, an American architect.

When KANTOR visited Minsk for the second time, in June.1959,
he was approached by Yevgeniy KAHN who said he had been in the United
States, implied he had been in New York and Washington, D.C., and
asked about KANTOR's background and the purpose of his visit. He also
asked that KANTOR meet him on the next day at the Hotel Byelorussia,
purportedly in connection with KANTOR's request for an extension of
his visa and sojourn permit in Minsk. KAHN appeared to KANTOR to be
more authoritative then SAZONOV,

The next day, KAHN told KANTOR that if he wanted to stay a
longer time with his relatives in Minsk, the Soviet authorities had to
be certain about his good intentions and good faith and that full infor-
mation was needed on his personal background, his family, his military
service, his friends, etc. KAHN asked KANTOR a lot of questions and
again talked at great length about peace and the war “threats from the
West and about how every "decent" and "honest" person should actively
participate in the peace fight. He offered KANTOR money and travel to
other places in the USSR, which KANTOR allegedly refused. Then
KAHN gave KANTOR an address to contact KAHN at in Moscow should
he desire to contact KAHN.



&

After the contact by KAHN, SAZONOV again began to make
more or less regular appearances and give "political indoctrination
talks." or

we

Towards the end of July 1959, after the extension of KANTOR's**°
sojourn permit, SAZONOV invited KANTOR to the Byelorussia Hotel
where KAHN was expecting them. During this meeting, KAHN
identified himself as a representative of an intelligence service
“razvedka" and made the first clear recruitment pitch. He wanted
KANTOR to sign a loyalty pledge that KANTOR would collaborate
with Soviet Intelligence. KANTOR claims he refused point blank.
An argument ensued during which KANTOR said, "If you trust me,
why should I sign anything."' In the end, KAHN said that KANTOR's a
oral agreement would be acceptable. KANTOR, however, refused a
this too and SAZONOV expressed "deep disappointment." Although
they took KANTOR to dinner and continued to belabor him, KANTOR
allegedly remained adamant and refused to collaborate. KANTOR did
not see KAHN again but SAZONOV appeared once or twice. KANTOR,
though shaken up by the incident, did not reveal the recruitment attemptito
his uncle. In the middle of August KANTOR obtained another extension of”
his visa and sojourn permit without difficulty.

On 1 or 2 September, KANTOR and his uncle were summoned to
appear at the OVIR and were brusquely informed that KANTOR had been
a 'tbad boy," had been "attending bad company," and that he was to leave
Minsk in three days. KANTOR connected this expulsion order with his
refusal to collaborate with the RIS. Since KANTOR had no valid Polish
transit visa he was turned back by Polish border authorities and had to
go to Moscow where he was admonished to register immediately with
the militia. He spent one night at the National Hotel in Moscow and
secured his East-German and Polish transit visas. He departed Moscow
on 7 September, exited USSR on 8 September and reached Copenhagen on
10 September 1959.

Although KANTOR, disgusted with the recruitment attempt and
his expulsion from the USSR, did not plan to go to the USSR again and
therefore did not seek further contacts with KHRYACHKOV in Copen-
hagen, he continued to frequent the International Club and there met
Vladislav Mikhailovich ABARCHALIN, in October or November 1959.
It was through ABARCHALIN that KHRYACHKOV resumed contact with

Ser

eg


KANTOR and explained that "they" had been too "rash" and that every-
thing could be straightened out. KANTOR had several street corner
meetings with KHRYACHKOV between November 1959 and April 1960.
KHRYACHKOV continued to ask KANTOR about his friends in Copen-
hagen and advised him to lose or destroy his passport because of the
many Soviet, East German and Polish visas in it.

In April 1960, KHRYACHKOV introduced KANTOR to another
Soviet, "Grigoriy' or “Georgiy," and told KANTOR that he should
maintain contact with “Georgiy." At the second meeting with Georgiy,
in the middle of May 1960, KANTOR was requested to submit a written
statement about his student friends in Copenhagen, which KANTOR
allegedly refused to do. KANTOR had two more meetings with Georgiy
during the summer of 1960, provided no information to him and moved
in October 1960, breaking contact.

In January 1961, KANTOR received a letter from his uncle in
Minsk asking if KANTOR could visit him again. KANTOR decided that
since he was returning to the United States in September another op-

portunity to visit the USSR might not materialize for a long time and so «

he decided to make another trip for "sentimental reasons." KANTOR
therefore visited the Soviet Embassy in January 1961 and there met
Georgiy who expressed his pleasure at seeing KANTOR again. Georgiy
met with KANTOR during the first week of February 1961, asked KAN-
TOR the same questions about foreign students and again was refused
information by KANTOR who said he was too busy with his studies.
However, KANTOR admitted that he gave Georgiy his new address and
did not explicitely refuse to meet him again. Georgiy appeared to be
disgusted with KANTOR and made no arrangements for another meeting.
KANTOR subsequently went to the Soviet Embassy several times that
spring in connection with his visa application and was told to come back
on.14 April 1961.

All of the above details were admitted by KANTOR during a de-
briefing by American Intelligence on 11 and 12 April 1961.

KANTOR identified Georgiy as Georgiy MOCHALOV {aka
MOTCHALOV), Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen.
He also identified photographs of Vladislav Mikhailovich ABARCHALIN
and Boris Fedorovich KHRYACHOV. KANTOR, in addition, identified
the following students who frequented the International Club and could

-ll-

ay


have had contact with Vladislav Mikhailovich ABARCHALIN: Rembert
Craven ALLEY and Philip ROSENBLUM.

A memorandum, dated 5 May 1961, regarding contact meetings
on 3 and 4 May, prepared by a CIA Staff Employee, contained this
addenda on KANTOR's contacts with the Soviets. KANTOR stated that at
the meetings on 1] and 12 April he had forgotten to mention an episode
that had occurred on his first trip the USSR in 1958. Before KANTOR
departed Copenhagen, KHRYACHKOV gave KANTOR two English language
books and two bottles of whiskey. KHRYACHKOV asked KANTOR to trans-
mit the books and one bottle of whiskey to one (FNU) SHARIFF, a member
of the staff on the Moscow News, whom KANTOR was to call up if he came
to Moscow, telephone number B 8-06-10, The second bottle of whiskey
was to be given to KANTOR's uncle as a present, On his return from
Minsk to Copenhagen, KANTOR spent three days in Moscow and stayed
at the Metropolé, He remembered KHRYACHKOV's request, called up
SHARIFF (Dzhavad Azizovich SHARIF) and was visited by SHARIFF at
the Hotel. KANTOR transmitted the two books and one bottle of whiskey
to SHARIFF who asked KANTOR to write a short article for the Moscow
News about his impressions in Minsk. KANTOR agreed and wrote about
two pages. SHARIFF accepted the article, gave KANTOR 500 rubles as
a fee, and promised to send KANTOR a copy of the issue if the article were
to be published. KANTOR signed a receipt for the money. KANTOR stated
that he did not make any copy and does not know whether the article was
ever used, KANTOR said that this was the only time that he had received
any money from the Soviets and that he felt there was nothing wrong with
this payment.

KANTOR explained his dealings with the Soviets - letting both
KHRYACHKOV and SAZONOV believe he was not opposed to being friends
with the Soviets - as a very clever and skilful devise to enable him to
keep the door open for further visits to the USSR, After the recruitment
pitch and after his semi-expulsion from the USSR, he maintained the con-
tact with KHRYACHKOV and later MOCHALOV only reluctantly and only
because he did not want to cause any trouble to his relatives in the USSR,
However, the only threat KANTOR received was from MOCHALOV who
told him once that if he did not collaborate, no visa would be forthcoming.

KANTOR admitted candidly that his desire to study the Russian
language was so strong in 1958 and 1959 that if, at that time, the Soviets
had offered him an opportunity to attend a Soviet university, he would


have accepted, even if he had been discouraged by U. S. authorities.
However, after his experience in 1959, he allegedly changed his view
radically and just wanted to be left alone. He could not, hqwever, |
provide a logical explanation of why he did not report everything to the
U. S. authorities. When questioned sharply on this point he became
emotional and stated that if he was still doing what the Soviets had told”
him to do he certainly would have grabbed the opportunity to destroy
his passport and simply deny that he had been in the USSR in 1959.

KANTOR stated he believed that while he had been very naive
in the beginning of his contacts with the Soviets and the RIS, he did not
really engage in any "subversive activity," did not supply any valuable
information to them, and did not commit anything conflicting with his
loyalty as a U. S. citizen.

Additional Information From CIA Re KANTOR:

A memorandum to the FBI, dated 9 August 1961, CSCI 3/766,
642, contained information from one of KANTOR's acquaintances re-
ferred to as “informant": : aes

a) In mid-June 1961, KANTOR tried to interest
the informant in taking a trip to the USSR of about three
weeks duration. . . KANTOR expressed a willingness
to absorb personally any of informant's expenses in ex-
cess of the estimated cost, within 'several hundred
krones'. KANTOR stated that if this trip did not materialize,
he would probably make a short trip to Yugoslavia, ‘for a
last look at Slavic Europe,' before returning to the States
. .. where he would attend the special language program
at Fordham University. . .

etn

"b) Subsequently, when the informant decided he
could not make the trip, KANTOR decided to call it off,
although he was still desirous of visiting the Soviet Union
again before returning to the United States.

"c) KANTOR felt that the USSR had honored all of her fone
agreements at Yalta and Potsdam and that the United States
had no legal rights in West Berlin, especially since the
USSR, legally at least, had moved out of East Berlin.

However, he feels neither the USSR nor the United
States is entirely in the right. He is favorable to-
wards the United States . . . however, if the USSR.

were to take the initiative (in a new approach to the =

problem), then he would have to side with them... oe
KANTOR appeared to be a strict Marxist (on economic
questions) . . . under Communism it is possible for

a backward nation to advance to the status of a major
power ina short time. The United States system,

. . . is out moded and run by profiteers and gangsters
who have no interest in the underpriviledged. Cul-
turally, the Soviets have better tasts and are moving =
ahead while the United States is standing still. . -
The main problem in the world is to prevent war and,
KANTOR feels, there is no doubt that the intentions of
the USSR are peaceful. a

845, reflects that the CIA had recently learned that KANTOR had been .
in daily contact with one William STEINSMITH, an American citizen born'*
about 1933, currently living in Denmark without a residence permit.
CIA had been advised, by a usually reliable source, that STEINSMITH
had maintained a clandestine contact with a Cuban official in Copenhagen,
Gabriel CALAFORR Salas, and had sold pro-CASTRO articles to the
local Danish press. It was also learned that KANTOR had recently ob-
tained a check for $1000 ostensibly from his father to pay for his fare
back to the United States. :

Possible Connection to OSWALD Investigation:

In a memorandum to the FBI, CSCI 316/00925-65, dated 2 March
1965, this Agency pointed out the following coincidences: in the backgrounds
of KANTOR and Lee Harvey and Marina OSWALD:

a) KANTOR was in Minsk, USSR, for six weeks dur-
ing the summer of 1958 and during the period 2 June to
September 1959. Although OSWALD apparently did not
arrive in Minsk until January 1960, Marina OSWALD,
-according to her own testimony, arrived in Minsk towards
the end of August.



b) KANTOR claimed to have been something of
an oddity in Minsk since he was the only American
residing there at the time. As such, he claimed.to
have attracted to himself a group of young Soviets
who displayed an unusual curiosity about America
and Western Europe. Among these young Soviets,
according to KANTOR, was a young man named
Igor (LNU), "whose father was a Soviet Army general.
OSWALD also reportedly considered himself to be an
oddity as the only American in Minsk and attracted
more or less the same type young Soviets as did
KANTOR. OSWALD listed among his close friends
in Minsk a young Soviet named Pavel GOLOVACHEV,
whose father ostensibly was a Soviet Army general. =

c) Both KANTOR and OSWALD had served as en-
listed men and technicians in the United States Marine
Corps.

d) As of 14 August 1964, KANTOR was employed
by the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, as a
lecturer in Slavic languages and literature. Marina
OSWALD was enrolled in a special English language
course at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, as
of March 1965.

GIA Interest in KANTOR:

Agency interest in Marvin KANTOR was first aroused upon re-
ceipt of information from the U. S. Consul in Copenhagen which was -
sent to the FBI in a memorandum dated 16 April 1959, _KANTOR had

On 29 November 1960, dispatch ©DCA}5769 xeported agent spotting

Headquarters replied by Dispatch dated 15 December 1960 warning of ~~
KANTOR's contact with Soviet Embassy Clerk, Vladislav ABARCHALIN

students in Denmark. This dispatch also warned that KANTOR was of

CIA had been in receipt of FBI Reports on KANTOR characterized as
“Internal Security-R," based upon receipt of information on his contacts
with ABARCHALIN and Rembert Craven ALLEY and his visits to the
USSR in 1958 and 1959.

On 10 February 1961, Headquarters was advised that Marvin
KANTOR was considered ripe for a direct approach to explore his
REDSKIN, LCIMPROVE, LCHARVEST potential. Headquarter traces
and POA were requested.

A POA was granted on 1 March 1961 for contract, assessment
and polygraph only.

Consequently, KANTOR was approached and interviewed on 11
and 12 April 1961. KANTOR revealed himself as a long-time, but
allegedly unwitting, Soviet Intelligence contact in Copenhagen. On 3
and 4 May 1961, a second debriefing was conducted. KANTOR reported
that he had visited the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen on 17 April 1961
and was told that his chances for a visa were practically non-existent.
It was noted a since KANTOR's REDSKIN.
potential had evaporatéd and since the RIS had made no move to renew
their contract, that no further action was warranted and KANTOR was
instructed to advise CIA of any further contact by the Soviets in Europe
and to advise the FBI if the RIS should seek to establish contact after
KANTOR's return to the U.S. The last contact of| (4-6
with KANTOR was on 29 August 1961, just prior to his return to the
U. S. on 2 September 1961.

On 7 May 1964, this Agency, in response to a request from the
U.S. Civil Service Commission, provided a summary of pertinent in-
formation on KANTOR,

On 25 August 1967, in response to an inquiry from the National
Security Agency, a copy of CSCI-3/781 263, dated 7 May 1964, pre-
viously sent to the Civil Service Commission, was made available with
the comment that it reflected all pertinent information available in CIA
files.

Soviets Involvéd in KANTOR Case:

NORMAN stated that Vladimir Vladimirovich IV: ANOV had the
case of Melvin (Marvin) KANTOR who was recruited by the 7th Depart"
ment, SCD, KGB, NORMAN did not know if IVANOV himself was in on
the recruitment of KANTOR but did consider that this was possible, -

i NORMAN did know that it could not have been Evgeni NOSKOV who re-,
cruited KANTOR, NORMAN also stated that the case on KANTOR was
turned over to the First Chief Directorate.

According to KANTOR's statement in 1961, he was approached in
Minsk in June 1959 by Yevgeniy KAN or KAHN who identified himself as
a representative of a Soviet Intelligence Service and made a recruitment
pitch which KANTOR allegedly turned down. KAN was described by +e
KANTOR as in his middle thirties (in 1959), balding, not of Jewish &
appearance, spoke English, said that he knew New York and Washington,
D.C., showed a certain familiarity with American life and American
slang. KAN also said he was a lawyer and that he normally resided in
Moscow. He appeared to KANTOR to be more authorative than KANTOR's
first Soviet official contact in Minsk, Victor Ivanovich SAZONOV. KANzi *,
TOR was approached by SAZONOV in Minsk in June 1958. SAZONOV was ~
described as 35-40 years of age, medium size, dark hair, low forehead, of
"sad dog" looks. SAZONOV spoke English and told KANTOR that he had
been stationed in Calcutta, India and that he knew Hindi.

KANTOR identified Boris Fedorovich -KHAYACHKOV, of the
Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen; Vladislav Mikhailovich ABARCHALIN
- whom KANTOR met about November 1959 in the International Club in
Copenhagen; and Georgiy MOCHALOV, Second Secretary of the Soviet
Embassy in Copenhagen to whom KANTOR was introduced in April 1960
by KHRYACHKOV as his replacement contact for KANTOR,

There is no evidence that KANTOR was in direct contact with

Vladimir Aleksandrovitch CHURANOV (TCHOURANOV). But an FBI
report, dated 10 June 1960, reflected receipt of information from a

oo

In 1961, KANTOR advised that KHRYACHKOV knew of Rembert
Craven ALLEY, an American architect who was a frequent visitor at



the International Club. KANTOR also advised that Rembert Craven
ALLEY seemed to be on closer terms with ABARCHALIN than other
students. KANTOR said that once, in the first days of November
1959, he met ABARCHALIN with Rembert Craven ALLEY and several
others outside at the "Drop Inn" restaurant which KANTOR used to :
patronize. KANTOR stated that it was ABARCHALIN who again put *
KANTOR into contact with KHRYACHKOV at the end of November 1959.
KANTOR said that he last saw ABARCHALIN at a stag party at ALLEY's s.
place at Christmas 1959, ©

Rembert Craven ALLEY, Jr. was interviewed by the FBI on 6
June 1961 regarding association with "LADISLAV" (ohonetic),_: anem- |
ployee of the Soviet Embassy at Copenhagen. i

Conclusions and Recommendations: sfanated ine ssenmsteOnrtanacer
aman ane Recommendations:

As early as 14 April 1961, it was written by the CIA officer who!
interviewed KANTOR that with all the benefit of doubt that could be given
to KANTOR regarding his involvement with the Soviets; KANTOR's
motivation for his continued contacts, after his second trip to the USSR -
in 1959, had to be considerably more complex than KANTOR had admitted.
The assessor stated:

‘In simple professional terms, from August 1957 -

July 1959, he has been under development by two RIS
representatives (KHRYACHKOV and SAZONOV), was

the target of a recruitment attempt by KAHN, collaborated
with KHRYACHKOV even after the alleged refusal of re-
cruitment from November 1959 - April 1960 and remained
a casual RIS contact and source for GRIGORIY from April
1960 until at least February 1961. He revealed his RIS in-
volvement only to his mother, did not report anything to
American authorities until confronted. . . Under slight
psychological pressure he confessed with an obvious sense :
of relief . . . But though Subject now claims that he feels wet
an American and that if it'comes to spying' he would rather

do it for his country, this late discovered loyalty does not

ving entirely convincing. . .

"The RIS has been in touch with Subject for more than &
three years, has exposed to him three representatives in
Copenhagen and two in the USSR, and obviously has not
written off Subject as a hopeless case."

Subsequent to the above evaluation, KANTOR tried to obtain a visa
to visit the Soviet Union in the summer of 1961 and did indeed return to ~
the Soviet Union in 1965, 1969 and 1970. KANTOR's repeated denials to f
the FBI that he has not been approached by Soviet Intelligence since his
departure from Copenhagen in 1961 and his suggestion that Soviet bureau-
cracy resulted in him not being identified with his previous visits to the
Soviet Union, deny the realities of KGB operations. as we know them.
(Will Professors Richard BURGI or Frederick BARGHOORN dare to re-
turn to the Soviet Union?) :

As a result of NORMAN's statements that KANTOR was recruited
by the Seventh Department, Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and turned
over to the First Chief Directorate, KANTOR should be considered as pos-
sibly an active agent of the First Chief Directorate, KGB, today.

Fortunately the FBI, with jurisdiction over this matter, is fully
apprised of all the facts herein.
Action:

Since KANTOR should be considered as a possible active agent of
the KGB, this case should remain open,
