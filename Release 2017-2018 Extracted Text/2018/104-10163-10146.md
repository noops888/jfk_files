native born U.S. father and a Cuban mother. His birth was recorded

at the U. Embassy and he was reconized as having acquired les.

eitizenship by blita through the citizenship of his father. He

traveled, not on a les. passport, but on an identity card proclaiming

his Unso eitizenshiye Turing Horld far Il, he entered the U.3

Army Air Corps, was shot down on his 12th Ission over Germany

and was a prisoner of war for l6 nonths.. He was honorably separated

aa a Captain.

eitizenship. According to BANKER's recollection, this occured

In 1953.

Dr. LAZO compiled a formidable file on the Subject

and was in communication with a Washington, D.C. legal firm

which BARKER dimly recalls as that of Edward Bennett WILLIAlS,

who was to handle the case locally. A private bill is intro

duced in the 83rd Congress by Congressman WILLIAHS of New Jersey

to restore the Subject's citizenship, but BARKEl does not know

why no action was taken on the bill. At the tine, he was in

financial difficulties and took a job as a tractor driver out

side Havana for about 8 months, In which period he had ro contact

with Dr. INZO, who, as BARKER belloves, interpreted his failure

to appear in the office as a lack of interest in pressing the case

to a successful conclusion.
