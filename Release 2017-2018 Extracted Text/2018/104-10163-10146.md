cLtizenship. According. to BARKER's recollection, this occured

why no action was taken on the bill. At the tine, he was in
financial difficulties and took a job as a sracter driver out-
side Havana for about 8 months, in which period he had no contact
with Dr. LAZO, who, a3 BARKER believes, interpreted his failure
