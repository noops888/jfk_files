RELEASE

7 Ga: 32
Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, i917. Ms. Garro attended
the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later
did ‘graduate work at Berkley in California and at the
University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married
to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals. when

if
Octavio was: named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple
separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also
named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early

life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity

about her native land and had a reputation for being one

if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena
was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of
Mexican life and made an important |contribution to its
artistic development.

i

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Senora en su_Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,
where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.
Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La_ Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

splendid success." Critics have said of her: “For
Elena Garro, there is no frontier between reality and
fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality--
perhaps more intense-- to which one may penetrate without
passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of
a literature fired with passion, flavor and life." Many
people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier
between reality and fantasy is‘ also difficult for her to
distinguish in real life.

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

€
the Confederacion Nacional Campésina (CNC), the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro
was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the
poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms
with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all
over the country.

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated
woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright
opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers
in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political
connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-
attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the
country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was
well disposed toward the United States and had been
friendly with Embassy officers. Her broad range of signifi-
cant personal friends, the views of many important to the
American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target. Through-
out the early 1960's she was carried as a target in the
Embassy's Youth Program.

American Embassy employees dealing with Elena
believed that despite her access to the underground happenings
in Mexico, including peasant unrest, since she had a tendency
to romanticize developments in reporting on them made it
difficult at times to determine what degree of credence

to place on.what.might truly be useful and concrete information.

Elena's Story and American Government Agency Follow-up

Elena Garro de Paz' story first came to the American
intelligence agencies' attention on October 5, 1964,
eleven days after the publication of the Warren Commission
Report. The source of The Blind Memo was a Central

Intelligence Agency asset known a COOKIE Iy(WX7241, p. 94,

Entry #430, CIA #721; Blind Memo dated 10/5/64, CIA #576).
The memo reported that Elena Garro de Paz, her daughter
and Deba Garro de Guerrero Galvan discussed meeting Oswald
in Mexico in the fall of 1963. The discussion was, reportedly,
sparked by the newspaper coverage given the Warren Report.

Elena and Deba are the first cousins of Horatio, Ruben
and Lynn Duran. Elena, her daughter and Deba were invited
to a "twist party" at the home of Ruben Duran. The party
was in the middle of a week in the fall of 1963. Lee Harvey
Oswald was at this party in the company of “two other
beatnik looking boys." (IBID.) The Americans remained
together the whole evening and did not dance. When Elena
tried to talk with them, she was "shifted" to another room.
One of Elena's cousins told her at the time that he (or she)
did not know who the Americans were except that Silvia Duran
had brought them to the party.

The day after the party Elena and Deba saw the same

three people on the Insurgentes, a main avenue in Mexico CLeye

The Garro's claimed that they had recognized Oswald's
photograph when it was published after the assassination.
The arrest of Silvia Duran "underlined their certainty"
that the man had been Oswald. (IBID.)

Deba added that Lynn and one of the Duran brothers
had made trips to Texas. She also said that, even though
they were always poor before the assassination, they were
both driving expensive new cars. A notation on the memo
says tha{Z/1 ‘axcooxre) never regained contact with
Elena Garro de Paz. (IBID.)

or Lee Harvey Oswald "P" files but in a project file. It
was found in December, 1965. See WX 7241, p. 94, CIA #721.)
A marginal notation on WX 7241 says, "Why was this not sent
to Headquarters??" (p. 87, CIA #714.)

On 10/12/64 the Chief of Covert Action, FNU Flannery,
wrote a memo for the record. (10/12/64 memo, CIA #596;
WX-7241, p. 87, CIA #714.) This memo reported that Elena

Garro de Paz had told her story to Eunice Odio who relayed

it to (ercunon
The story is not as detailed as the 10/5/64 version.
There is no mention of Deba Garro Guerrero Galvan. The
story, perhaps because it is third hand, differs from the
previous story in two areas. The party was at the Cuban

Embassy not at Ruben Duran's. Elena talked to a Cuban


EJL First Draft
Page 6

Embassy official not one of her cousins about the three
Americans.

A note, attached to the memo, to the Chief of
Station, Winston Scott, from Flannery reads, "Do you want
me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?." Scott
replied "Yes, but we should follow up first." Flannery
then wrote: "Nothing further." Scott then noted that
the memo should be filed. The file indications show that
the memo went into the Oswald "P" file and the Elena
Garro “P" file. (IBID.)

On 24 November 1964 a CIA informant reported some

information he had learned from CHANEY (Memo from

Win Scott to the Files, re: June Cobb, 11/25/64, CIA Nos.
592-593; WX-7241, p. 88, Entry #404, CIA #715.) June Cobb

Garro. Elena 01 {IA n= she tried to talk to
Robert Kennedy when he was in Mexico because she had met
Oswald "and two friends (Cubans)" at Horacio Duran's house

represent the Warren Commission. The COS noted that he had
asked the informant to gee{ixcnann/1 feo pursue the story.

On November 24, 1964 Elena and her daughter met
with Mexico City representatives of the Legal Attache's
office. They recounted the same story previously given

[COOKIE x4] The date of the party was given as September

30, October 1 or October'2, 1963. (FBI 105-825555 Report,
Dec. 11, 1964 entitled Lee Harvey Oswald, P.1) The agent
who wrote the report noted that the FBI investigation of
the John F. Kennedy assassination had established that Lee
Harvey Oswald had departed Mexico City by bus at 8:30 a.m.
on October 2, 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald could not have been
identical with the American allegedly observed by Mrs. Paz
at the party if this party were held on the evening of
October 1 or October 2, 1963. (IBID. p. 3)

Elena was questioned regarding the identity of other
persons attending the party at the Ruben Duran home who
might have been in a position to observe the three Americans.
Elena stated that in the course of the party her daughter
met a young man named "Alejandro" at the party and danced
with him. He was apparently quite smitten with the
daughter and tried to call her on several occasions after
the party. The daughter did not take the calls and as
a result "Alejandro" wrote several letters to the daughter.
Ms. Garro exhibited two of the letters, as well as a

business card which identified the young man as Ario Alejandro

Page 8

ee Stenius. (IBID)

The letter which Ms. Garro said was the first
written by the young man to her daughter bore the date
September 1, 1963 and the Mexico City Post Office postmark
September 2, 1963. When Ms. Garro was told this she
commented that probably the Communists have facilities
for falsifying postcards. (IBID)

To further investigate Ms. Garro's story the Federal
Bureau interviewed Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius on
November 27, 1964. (IBID.) Lavadnini recalled that there
were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran party,
few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexican girl
who had recently returned from living in France. He was
unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it was
probably early in September because of a heavy rain which
occurred as they were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m.
(IBID. p. 4)

Tavsgninl noted no Americans present at this party.
He was familiar with the appearance of Lee Harvey Oswald
because of publicity following the assassination of President
Kennedy but otherwise had no knowledge of him and had neyer
seen him except for news photographs following the assassina-
tion, (IBID. p. 4)

There is no indication on the document that this
information was given to the Central Intelligence Agency's

Mexico City Station.

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political ‘officer
at the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a
conversation with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587,
WX-7241 Entry No. 425, p. 91, CIA No. 718.) The meeting
with Elena had been about other matters but she mentioned
knowing Oswald. Thomas noted that she was reluctant to
talk but did.

Elena's story reported here is the same, but with

more details, as that given in the She

said that General Clark Flores, Silvia Duran, Eusebio

Azcue, Emilio Carballido, and a Latin American Negro man

with red hair were at the party. A marginal comment by this

entry in WX-7241 says, "How did Elena know about a red-haired

Negro?" Elena also told Thomas that she had later learned

that Silvia Duran had been "Oswald's mistress while he

was there." (A note by this entry in WX-7241 says "How

did Elena Garro know about Silvia being the mistress of

Oswald?? This is 1965. Station heard from (Eretnc/afin

July 67; see also WX-7241, Entry 613, p. 116, CIA No. 743.)
Elena told Thomas that she and her daughter had

gone to the Cuban Embassy in November 1963. Once inside

the gates they shouted “assasins" and other insults at

the Embassy employees. Shortly after this incident a

friend, Manuel Calvillo, an official in the Gobernacion,

took her and her daughter to a small hotel in the center


EJL First Draft
Page 10

of Mexico City. They were kept there for eight days
under the pretext that they were in danger. Elena
claimed to have told Calvillo that she wanted to tell
her story to the American Embassy. Calvillo dissuaded
her by telling her that the American Embassy was full
of Communist spies. Elena said that some of the other
people who had been at the party were taken to Veracruz
where they were “protected" by Governor Lopez Arias.
She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly "protected" by
General Clark Flores, was very prosperous and was driving
a big car.

The COS wrote a note on the memo which says: “What
an imagination she has!?! Should we send to Headquarters?"

The Officer replied, “Suggest sending. There have been

stories around town about all this, and Thomas is not

only person she has talked to...If memory serves me, didn't

in one of her squibs?" (CIA No. 588, note from SW to Cos.)

efer to Oswald and the local leftists and Cubans

The information in Thomas' 12/10/65 report was
cabled to CIA Headquarters (Cable from Mexico City to the
Director, Mexi 5621, date cut off my copy; CIA Nos. 584-585.)
This cable reports that Elena is the wife of the “prominent
Mexican poet Mexican Ambassador Delhi Octavio Paz Lozano."
(IBID.) The cable informed Headquarters of the substance
of Thomas' report including the fact that Elena claimed

that Ruben Duran later told her that he was not really a Communist


EJL First Draft
Page ll

and that killing Kennedy had been a mistake. (IBID; see

also Thomas' 12/10 report.) The cable said that Elena's

story would be checked with cemann/a) against the pro-
duction from the Cuban surveillance operation “and other
sources." (IBID.) Scott wrote, next to the routing
indications on the cable, "Please ask Charles Thomas

if he'll "follow-up". Get questions from Anne G. Please
let's discuss. Thanks."

After the December 10 memorandum/conversations
Winston Scott (Chief/Station) and Nathan Ferris (Legal
Attache) called C. Thomas for a meeting. They asked him
to get a more detailed replay of Ms. Garro's story. At
this meeting Winston Scott made it clear that the FBI
had full responsibility for any further investigation in
the Oswald case. (State Dept: letter from Charles Thomas
to William P. Rogers, July 25, 1969, JFK Doc. # )

Thomas met with Elena again on December 25, 1965.
“The same date he wrote a memorandum of conversation which
provided a much more detailed and accurate restatement of
Ms. Garro's alleged encounter with Lee Harvey Oswald and
subsequent developments. (CIA Nos. 580-583; WX-7241, Entry
#427, p. 92, CIA #719)

Elena admitted that she had spoken to two men at
the Embassy "(presumably from the Legal Attache's Office) ."
She said that she did not tell them the whole story

because “the Embassy officers did not give much credence


EJL First Draft
Page 12

to anything she and Elenita said" (Ibid.)

She stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's
home. She was unclear about the date of the party. It
was a few days before the Soviet Astronaut, Gagarin,
visited Mexico; she thought that this would put the party
around September 2 or 3, 1963. She believed that the party
was on a Monday or Tuesday because it was an odd night for
a party. The memo noted that september 1 and 2 were
indeed a Monday and Tuesday. Elena could not check her
calender to refresh her memory at the time of the interview
because the calender was in a desk that had been stored
away.

During the conversation Elena described Oswald
and his companions. The man who she thought was Oswald
wore a black sweater. She said he was quiet “and stared a
lot at the floor." One of his companions "was very tall
and slender and had long blond hair which hung across his
forehead. He had a gaunt ee and a rather long protruding
chin." The other companion was also tall, with short,
light brown hair and no really distinguishing characteristics.
The three Americans did not dance or mix with the other
guests. Elena saw the same three men on the street the
next day. (IBID.)

Elena was certain that Eusebio Azcue, Horacio Duran,
Silvia Duran, Lydia Duran, Deba Guerrero, General Clark

Flores and his mistress, a doctor from Dalinde Hospital,


EJL First Draft
Page 13

a young American couple who were honeymooning in Mexico,
and several other people were at the party. She said
that Ricardo Guerra, whom she claims converted Horatio
Duran to Communism, and his wife, Rosario Castellanos,
were supposed to be at the party but did not show up.
(IBID. )

The red-haired man and Emilio Carballido were not
at the party that Oswald attended but at another party
where Carballido and Azcue got into a heated argument
about President Kennedy. "They came to the conclusion
that the only solution was to kill him." (IBID.) Elena
was not clear on whether this party was before or after
the party where she met Oswald.

Elena said that Carballido “is a known Castro
agent in Mexico." After the assassination he spent a year
in Cuba. He then got a job teaching at Rutgers University
through Dr. Jose Vasquez Amaral.

The incident at the Cuban Embassy, where Elena and
her daughter shouted "assassins", etc., at the Embassy
employees, occured on November 23rd at or about 3:00
p-m. Elena and Elenita were driven to the Cuban Embassy
by Elena's brother who was embarrassed by their behavior.
This occured before they had seen photographs of Oswald.

Later that day they were visited by Manuel Calvillo
who told them that they were in serious danger from the

Communists and that he would take them to a small hotel,


EJL First Draft
Page 14

where they would be safe, for a few days. Elena said
she trusted and believed Calvillo because he was a
known undercover agent for the Gobernacion. He was
also a friend of Noe Palomares and Gustavo Diaz Ordaz.
Calivillo also told Elena and her daughter that Silvia
Duran had been arrested. Duran's arrest was not public
information at the time.

Elena could not remember the name of the hotel so
she took Thomas to the section of Mexico City where she
thought it was. They found the hotel. It was the Vermont
Hotel, Calle Vermont 29. Elena said that she assumed
that Calvillo had registered them as relatives or friends.
They stayed at the hotel until the following Friday, Nov.
30, 1963 hardly leaving their rooms.

While they were at the hotel they saw the photos
of Oswald and realized that he had been the man at Ruben
Duran's party. When Calvillo visited them at the hotel
Elena told him that she wanted to report it to the :
American Embassy. Calvillo dissuaded her by stating
that the ‘American Embassy was full of Communists. When
Elena returned to her home, guards were posted outside.

After she returned home Elena saw her sister,

Deba Guerrera. Deba had also come to the same conclusion

independently of Elena. Deba was "terrified." Approximately


EJL First Draft
Page 15

two months after the assassination two “communists" had
visited Deba and threatened her never to reveal that

she had been to a party with Oswald. Deba, consequently,
would not accompany Elena to the American Embassy to tell
her story.

Elena said that a few days after the assassination
Emilio Carballido took the Duran's to Jalapa, Veracruz and
“kept them out of the way until the initial shock of the
assassination wore off."

Elena also said that shortly after the assassination
an American named June Cobb spent several days in her
house. Ms. Cobb had been sent to Elena by a mutual friend,
Eunice Odio. Eunice Odio was a Costa Rican who had been
Vasquez Amaral's mistress when Amaral was with the Rockefeller
Foundation. In 1965 Ms. Cobb and Ms. Odio were roommates.
While Ms. Cobb was at Elena's house she expressed a interest
in the Kennedy assassination. Deba got drunk one night
and told Ms. Cobb the entire story. Ms. Cobb wanted them
to go to the American authorities. Claiming to be a CIA
agent, Cobb advised wananee going to the American Embassy.
She suggested that Elena and Deba go to Texas to tell their
story. When her suggestion was rejected, Cobb said that
she would arrange a meeting with the CIA Station Chief.

The meeting did not occur because Ms. Cobb was asked to


EJL First Draft
Page 16

leave the Garro house; evidently because she kicked
Elena's cat.

Ruben Duran visited Elena around the end of
January, 1964. He was worried that Oswald's visit to
his home might be discovered and that he might lose
his Mexican citizenship. Ruben told Elena that it had
been Silvia who had gotten him involved with Oswald.
Rubefi added that he was not really a communist and
had opposed the assassination.

Elena said that she had told her story to Noe
Palomares of the Gobernacion about six months after the
assassination. He advised against going to the American
Embassy and told her that if she did anything at all
she should merely write an anonymous letter.

Elena stated that it was "common knowledge"
that Silvia had been Oswald's mistress. When asked who
could verify the allegation she could only remember one
person who had told her this. That person was Victor
Rico Galan, a “pro-Castro journalist."

During these conversations Elena also said that
she “understood" that Oswald had been in Mexico more
than once. (IBID.)

On the first page of Thomas' December 25 1965
memorandum of conversation Winston Scott wrote “Shouldn't
we send to Headquarters?" Someone responded “Of course."

(IBID.)


EJL First Draft
Page 17

Charles Thomas wrote July 25, 1969 that "he got
no reaction from Nathan Ferris and Winston Scott" regarding
his memorandum of December 25, 1965. (State Department:
Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary of
State, July 25, 1969). Thomas wrote that Deputy Chief
of Mission, Clarence Boonstra (State Dept.) who was in
charge of Affairs at the time of the John F. Kennedy
assassination and subsequent Oswald investigation told him
that Oswald had not been in Mexico on the date given for
the party. Boonstra also stated that the informant had
changed her story. Thomas further wrote that even when
he reiterated that Elena had not changed her story but
that rather she had now given a more accurate account,
Boonstra stated that the date was wrong and dismissed
the whole affair. (IBID. p. 2) The Legat's Office in
Mexico City replied that Thomas' office had been advised
by memoranda dated December 27, 1965 and February 23, 1966
that since Elena Garro's allegations had previously been
investigated without substantiation, no further action
was being taken concerning her recent repetition of those
allegations. The Legat's Office concluded that either the
Counselor for Political Affairs did not route the memoranda

heotd
to Charles Thomas or that Thomas did not recall them. (FBI

Report, 9/30/69, pp. 3-4, JFK Document No. )


EJL Field Report
Page 18

Subsequent to December 25, 1965, Thomas wrote in
the Dec. 25, 1965 memo that Elena had found her calendar
and had reconstructed the date of the party as late
September not early September. When Thomas went to
Ferris' office and informed him, Ferris replied that
Elena had given the late September date when she had
originally reported her story at the American Embassy.
However, Mr. Ferris explained that someone who had been
at the party had stated that there were no Americans
there. Mr. Ferris did not reveal that Ario Alejandro
Lavagnini Stenius Ferris had provided this information.
Mr. Ferris suggested that it was not necessary for Thomas
to pursue the matter since he considered the Oswald case
closed and had heard all the rumors before. (IBID.)

The Legal Attache, Mr. Ferris wrote in his September
30 memorandum--that he did not tell Mr. Thomas that someone
else who was at the party had stated that there were no
Americans there. (FBI Report, 9/30/69, p. 4 JFK No. )
Mr. Ferris also wrote that he had told Thomas that it
would not be necessary for him to pursue the matter any
further since Elena's story had been heard before and investigated
without being substantiated. He wrote that he told Thomas that
Elena's story was considered a closed issue not that the Oswald
case was closed. (IBID.)

That there had been no Americans at the party puzzled


EJL First Draft
Page 19

Thomas. He had assumed that Elena could have

clearly been mistaken about the identity of the Americans
she saw there, but never doubted that she had seen some
Americans. Thomas wrote that he had never discussed the
Oswald case with Ms. Guerrero de Galvan but that her
grown son had told him that he was convinced that his
mother had seen Lee Harvey Oswald. (State Department:
Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary
of State, July 25, 1969).

On December 27, 1965 the Legal Attache wrote a
memo to the Ambassador regarding Elena. (Memo to the
Ambassador from the Legal Attache, 12/27/65, CIA #578;
WX-7241 Entry #429, p. 94, CIA #721.) ‘This is one of
the memos the Legal Attache refers to in the Sept. 30, 1969
memo. It reported that Elena and her daughter were inter-
viewed on 17 and 24 November 1964. The memo said that
they furnished information similar to that in Thomas'
12/10/65 memo. The Legat memo goes on to say “Inquiries
conducted at that time, (November '64) however, failed to
substantiate the allegations made by Mrs. Garro de Paz and
her daughter. In view of the fact that Mrs. Garro de Paz'
allegations have been previously checked out without
substantiation, no further action is being taken concerning
her recent repetition of those allegations." (IBID.)

Win Scott wrote a note to Anne Goodpasture on this


EJL First Draft
Page 20

memo. The note says, "Can we send in a report to
Headquarters 'dismissing' our cable?" Goodpasture
responded, "done." (IBID.)

The cable being dismissed is Mexi 5621 (see above).
The next entry in Oswald's Mexican file is a cable
written by Ann Goodpasture. (Memo from Mexico City to
the Director, 12/29/65, Mexi 5741, CIA #575; WX-7241 Entry
#430, p. 94, CIA #721.) The cable reports the Legat
interview and the failure to substantiate Elena's story.
The cable promises to keep Headquarters advised if any
further information is developed. (IBID.)

In the site(Lxcoonr8 sgh 0/5/64 memo is attached to
this cable. WX-7241 explains this by saying, in a

cooKtEifeas not in

(Oswald's file), but was copied from (a project file)

marginal comment, "This document byt

and attached to Mexi 5741, 29 Dec. 65." (IBID.)

A note attached to this cable by
"I don't know what FBI did in Nov 64, but the Garro's
have been talking about this for a long time and she is
said to be extremely bright." Ann Goodpasture wrote that
the FBI had found Elena's allegations unsubstantiated but
that “we will try to confirm or refute Mrs. Garro de Paz's
information and follow up." Win Scott wrote, “She is also
'nuts'." (IBID; CIA #574)

On 1/9/66 Charles Thomas wrote another memo about

a conversation with Elena. (Memo of Conversation, 1/9/66,


EJL First Draft
Page .21

CIA #573; WX-7241, Entry #451, p. 95, CIA #722.) ‘This
memo reported that Elena said that Victor Rico Galan had
told her that Eusebio Azcue was “one of the most powerful
men in Cuba." Elena said that Azcue was a Spanish Cuban
who had fought in the Spanish Civil War and, by his own
admission, had served at that time as a French intelligence
agent.

The above mentioned memo is attached to a State
Department Memo (Memo #A-727 to Department of State from
Amembassy, Mexico, 1/22/66, CIA No. 572; WX-7241 Entry
#451, p. 95, CIA #722/) This memo reports that Victor
Rico Galan is a Spanish born Mexican journalist who has
been one “of the most prolific and ardent apologists for
Castro's Cuba in Mexico."

On February 3, 1966 Anne Goodpasture sent Thomas'
memo to the Cuban section with an attached note asking
them to check whether Elena was “seen creating such a
disturbance as they claimed in front of the Cuban
Embassy." (Note from Ann Goodpasture to "Cubans",
2/3/66, CIA No. 579; WX-7241, Entry 428, p. 94, CIA #721.)

One Cuban section officer responded, "No bells
ring with me." Another one wrote "Me neither." The
third officer wrote "No pictures either." (IBID.) There

is no indication that the penetration agents in the Cuban


EJL First Draft
Page 22

Embassy were queried about this. (IBID.) That there are

no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed that the

event happened: 1.) on a Saturday at 3:00 p.m. when

the Cuban Embassy was not normally photographically
surveilled; and 2.) the "disturbance" occured inside the
Cuban compound. HSCA Examination of the CIA Cuban Embassy
photographic surveillance showed no surveillance on 11/23/63.
(Classified Summary of Staff. Review of CIA Documents, ‘
undated, P. 3, CIA #763.)

On 2/23/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to the
Ambassador regarding the Garros: allegations. (Memo from
Legat to Ambassador, 2/23/66, CIA #571; WX-7241 Entry #455,
p. 95, CIA #722.) This memo reports that "extensive investi-
gation" failed to disclose that Oswald had traveled to
Mexico prior to September 26, 1963 and that no information
had developed that would show that he had not been in
New Orleans in the early part of that month. The memo
repeated that no further action was being taken by ‘the
FBI because her allegations had not been substantiated.
(IBID.) A marginal comment by this entry in WX-7241 says,
“How can it be ascertained that Oswald did not travel
to Mexico prior to early Sept. 63? There must be some
basis for Elena's reporting." (IBID; referenced to

Thomas' 12/25/65 memo.)

On 7/13/66 Charles Thomas wrote another memo.
(Memorandum of Conversation by Charles Thomas, 7/13/66,
CIA #565; WX-7241, Entry 460, p. 96, CIA #723.)

Elena had received an invitation to visit Cuba
from Ambassador Joaquin Hernandez Armas. She gave
Thomas two letters to support the claim. She said the
letters had been delivered to her home by a driver from
the Cuban Embassy. The envelopes gave her address as
Vermont 38. Because of her stay at the Hotel Vermont
she saw the letters as a threat and was frightened.

Thomas also reported that Elena had recently run
into Lydia Duran. Elena said that Lydia was now very
poor and had a job with the Difusion Cultural at the
Anthropological Museum. (IBID.)

On 10/13/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to
the CIA/COS reporting that a reliable confidential
informant had reported that the records of the Hotel Vermont
disclosed that "Elena Paz, housewife from San Luis Potosi"
had registered at the Hotel Vermont on November 23, 1963.
She left on November 30, 1963. The memo said that "the
above individual may or may not be identical with Elena
Garro de Paz." (Memo from Legat to Winston Scott, 10/13/66,
CIA No. 564; WX-7241, Entry #466, p. 98, CIA #725; Thomas'

7/13/66 memo.)

Charles Thomas' 12/25/65 memo said, “She (Elena)
and her daughter did not personally register at the hotel.
She thinks Calvillo registered them as relatives or friends
of his from San Luis Postosi." (Memo of Conversation by
Charles Thomas, 12/25/65, p. 3, CIA #582.)

The entry for the 10/13/66 Legat memo in WX-7241
bore the. notation "This is what Elena claimed and no one
would believe her." (WX-7241, Entry #466, p. 98, CIA #725.)

On 2/7/67 Charles Thomas wrote another memo.
(Memorandum of Conversation, 2/7/67, CIA #563.) Elena
told Thomas that Horatio Duran presently worked for Joaquin
Cisneros, the private Secretary of Mexican President Diaz
Ordaz. Elena says that Horatio Duran recently interviewed with
Cisneros to order the Gobernacion to grant an entry visa
for the son of Eusebio Azcue. (IBID.)

No further reports on Elena's story were generated
until 1969 when Charles Thomas was "selected out."
("Selected out" is aphrase used when an officer is retired
after having been in one grade for the maximum period of
time and is not considered qualified for promotion to a
higher grade). Then, he wrote a letter and memorandum
to the Secretary of lane saying, “Since I was the Embassy
Officer in Mexico who acquired this intelligence information,

I feel a responsibility for seeing it through to its final

evaluation." (State Dept.: Letter from Charles Thomas to
William Rogers, Secretary of State, July 25, 1969. in the
letter, Mr. Thomas also writes, "whereas the FBI has
discounted Elena Garro's allegations, the CIA is still
considerably disturbed by them." (IBID.) The Legat's

office in response wrote that E@{from the CIA had

indicated that he was aware of Elena's unreliability.
(FBI report, 9/30/69, P- 7, JFK Document No. )
The Legat's office further wrote that the concept that
every person who passes on to another government agency
information relating to matters within the jurisdiction
of that agency has the responsibility and authority

to review and evaluate the action taken by that agency

is, of course, untenable. (IBID.)

House Select Committee on Assassination

Investigation of Elena Garro's Alle jations
gs.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations
investigated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews
and personal interviews. The Committee requested and
reviewed the CIA's, FBI's and State Department: Files, when
they existed, on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz,
Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia Duran,
Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio Azcue,
and Emilio Carballido. only the Elena Garro de Paz file

contained information on her allegations. Though all the

names listed above played a role in Elena Garro de Paz

story, not one of their files included a reference to
Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence
agency 's[LrcooKrE I, LICHANT I, LIRING 3, LIHUFF I and

Sylvia Duran had been arrested before it was public
knowledge.

Since a file review lead nowhere, the Committee
decided to arrange interviews in Mexico with Sylvia Duran,
Elena Garro, Elenita Garro, Horacio Duran, Ruben Duran,
Lynn Duran, Emilio Carbillido and Betty Serratos. The
Mexican Government informed us that Elena and Elenita
Garro had disappeared -_ 1968 during the student uprisings
and had never returned to Mexico. The officials stated
that Elena and her daughter might be in Spain. (See Mexico
City Procedural Write-up Trip 1.) Emilio Carballido
could not be found. The others were interviewed between
June 1 and June 6, 1978.

Betty Serratos, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran, and Horatio
Duran all stated that Elena was not the dancing type and
therefore did not attend any of the twist parties at the
Duran homes. (See: HSCA Staff Interview of Betty Serratos,
6/6/78, .p. 6, JFK Document No. ; HSCA Staff

No. +)

When Sylvia Duran was asked if Elena or Elenita Garro

(Supra p. 13) He also told Elena that


EJL First Draft
Page 28

ever attended twist parties at the Duran homes, she stated
that she recalled Elena attending one twist party at
Ruben's home in 1963 when she returned to Mexico from
France. (HSCA Staff Interview of Sylvia Triado Bazan,
6/6/70, p. 90, JFK, Document No. ) All the Durans
denied that Lee Harvey Oswald had attended any party at
one of their homes.:

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence

Agency to provide for interviews

other assets that might help clear the Lee Harvey Oswald
trip to Mexico City. (

The Agency declined to aid the Committee. (

The Committee decided to return to Mexico and
attempt to locate the individuals. The Mexican govern-
ment told the Committee that June Cobb Sharp received a
tourist permit, number 72781, on June 27, 1947 when she
entered Mexico through Nuevo Lareda She asked, but was
denied, permission to represent the magazine, Modern Mexico.
On June 21, 1948, she received a courtesy permit, number
25556. She disappeared in 1954 and never returned to
Mexico. (See Procedural Writeup Trip 2 Mexico City) The
Committee knows the information is incorrect. Ms. June

Cobb was also in Mexico from 1961 through 1966. (CIA


EJL First Draft
Page 29

Report, 1965, June Cobb File, 201 No. )

The Mexican government told the Committee that
Manuel Calvillo did not live at Cuahtemoc 877-5 as the
Committee had stated. Their agent in charge had spoken
to the superintendent at the apartments for the past
twenty-five years who said that no Manuel Calvtilo had
ever’ resided there. When Committee staffers gave the
Mexican government Calvillo's pen name, the Mexicans
gave the same answers. (See Procedural Write Mexico City
Trip 2) The Committee is quite certain that Mr. Calvillo
lives at this address since it acquired the address from

a recent CIA document. (

The Committee believes that there is a possibility
that the Mexican government received orders from the
Central Intelligence Agency {to jnot; aid it. (See: Procedural
Write-Up Mexico City Trip 2). The Committee did’ interview
Noc W. Palomares who told the Committee that "Elena was
so brilliant that anything she imaged became real."

(See HSCA Staff Interview of Noe W. Palomares, 8/10/78, p.
1, JFK Document No.

The Committee made every attempt possible to locate
Elena. On July 7, 1978 a Committee staffer telephoned
her published Mortiz in Mexico City and asked about her

whereabouts. (HSCA Staff Contact Report, 7/7/78, JFK Docu-

Page 30

ment No. 10016) The publisher stated that Ms. Garro
was living in the Hotel S.A.C.E. in Madrid, Spain. The
Committee staffer telephoned the Hotel in Spain and spoke
to the manager who told him that Ms. Garro had moved out.
(HSCA Staff Contact Report, 7/7/78, JFK Document No.
On July 14, 1978 a Committee staffer recalled her publisher
who told him that he should call the Mexican Embassy
in Madrid, Spain. He stated that all her checks were
sent there because she was so paranoid that she did not
even trust her publisher with her address. (HSCA Staff
Contact Report, 7/14/78, JFK Document No. 9950) The Com-
mittee staffer called the Mexican Embassy in Madrid,
Spain and spoke to Adolfo Padilla, an employee who stated
that when Elena visited the Embassy a couple of weeks
before to pick up a check she looked financially poor.
He stated that when he asked Elena her new address she
declined to give one, stating that she would return every
few weeks to pick up checks and mail. The staffer left
the Committee's number and a message asking Elena to tele-
phone the Committee collect. (HSCA Staff Contact Report,
8/31/78, JFK Document No. )

On September 5, 1978, Elena Garro called the
Committee staffer. When the staffer explained that the
Committee wished to talk to her in person and would pay

both her daughter's and her travel from Spain, Ms. Garro


EJL First Draft

Page 31

asked why she should believe the:staffer was who he claimed.
The staffer asked Ms. Garro to call back collect in the
next few days when he could explain to her when and to
whom she could go in the American Embassy to pick up a
letter from the Committee explaining when and why we
wanted to see her. (HSCA Staff Contact Report, 9/5/78,
JFK Document No. ) The letter was written and
arrangements were made with the American Embassy in Spain
so that Elena could pick up the letter. (See attached
letter: also, HSCA Staff Contact Report, 9/5/78, JFK Do-
cument No. )

On September 7, 1978, Elena Garro called the
Committee staffer and asked when the letter would arrive.
The Committee staffer explained that the letter should
be picked up on Monday, September 11, 1978 from George
Phelan, the Counsellor for Consular Affairs at the Ameri-
can Embassy. Ms. Garro stated that she would pick up
the letter and follow our suggestions. (HSCA Staff
Contact Report, 9.7/78, JFK Document No.

Ms. Garro never picked up the letter. (HSCA Staff
Contact Report, 9/15/78, JFK Document No. )

The Committee, hoping she would pick up the letter before
her flight date, proceeded to purchase tickets for both
Elena and her daughter. (HSCA Staff Contact Report,

9/12/78, JFK Document No. ) Elena never picked
