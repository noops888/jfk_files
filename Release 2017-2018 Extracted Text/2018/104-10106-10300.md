Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO

IDENTIFICATION: NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
KGB officer who defected in 1964 and
was subsequently involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for
a period of approximately three years.

BACKGROUND H NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962
and subsequently defected. in January
1964. NOSENKO was brought to the U.S.
and after a period of relative freedom
he was involuntarily confined in
- April 1964. From April 1964 to
August 1965, -he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1965 to

Oc, -NOSENKO was confined
a Virginia. In October
1967, he was returned to the Washington

area, given increasing amounts of

freedom until he was given total free-

dom in April 1969. NOSENKO became a

U.S. citizen in April 1974. NOSENKO
atm was employed by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. His present
salary is $23,500 per year.

APPROVAL : (1) The legal basis to confine NOSENKO
against his will was discussed by
Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).
(2) There are a series of lettérs from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 § 5).

Eee COMMENTS

(C

¢

By memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DDCI summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Both reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and chalienges the above two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters ,
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated 5 August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

MEMORANDUM FOR-RECORD ”

SUBJECT: Discussion with Deputy Attorney.
ae General on Nosenko Case -_.

He “Fyectr Hels,’ Mr. ‘Houston and Mr, Murphy met with
the Deputy Attorney General and nembers of his staff to
discuss subject case. Present from Hr. Katzenbach' s--

2. Mr. Helas explained the Nosenko case briefly :
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two problens on which we ..-
would like the advice of the Department of Justice.
First, we would seeon feel coupelled to begin hostile :
interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth

with respect to his mission for the KGB and we wondered *.:

what the legal position would be in circuastances in

: which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-

pose. . Second, we would have to be ready after determin-
ing. that we could obtain no additional infomation fron -
Nosenko to deport him. We had thought of taking hin to

Germany. and transferring him to Soviat custody in Borlin
where this has been done a number: of tines in the past. .

fis There was soae discussion of whether deportation.

to another country wight be a consideration, Hr. Halas —
explained we would prabably face publicity problems in
deportiag to a third country of the kind we would en-
counter if he were free in the U. S. Nr.’ Helms noted
there were many items of. information which we and the

_ FBI realize are of no Significance because of the file

holdingsswe have but which an unscrupulous newspaper nan

could use’ to create sischief. This aspect was then dropped

and it was the consensus. that Berlin was probably the best
place, :

4. The question of the basis for detention was again

raised and related by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. He is hore as an “ox~
clusion and parole case” which means he has not been
admitted and has been paroled to the Agency which is
responsible for him while hoe is in this country. This



_in Berlin.

i : Be

parole can be interpreted to mean’ parole to a specific 5
locale which would provide. Sone Justification for our __
detaining hin for questioning, It was then pointed out, ~
however, that) if he said he wished to leave the country

to return to the Soviet Union, technically we would not .
bo able to detain. hin- further. | In this event, we would

be faced with the need to deport his quickly and quietly
and for this purpose the. immigration warrant of arrest.

and deportatio: was probably the“best instrument,

.. Se. Mr.. Katzenbach asked ro Foley to check inte =
this and Hr. Foley will in turn contact Mr. Houston,
Mr. :Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA-—
Office of Security officials to get the background-of :
their liaison with the INS on these matters, asian!

6. Mr. Helus thankad.Mr. Katzenbach for his assistance
and wa departed amid sone jovial banter with respect to
“The Spy Who Came in Fros the Cold" about what we expected
to happen to him when he started to clinb aver that “wali
