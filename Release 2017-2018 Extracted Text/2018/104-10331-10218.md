Dear Admiral Studeman:

I am writing to request information related to the assassination of

President Kennedy•

First, I would like to know the whereabouts of Mr. Gilberto Lopez.

Until

November, 1963, Mr. Lopez had been living in Tampa, Florida.

On November 23, 1963

Mr.

Lopez entered Mexico from Nuevo Laredo,

Texas, and on November 27 he boarded a Cubana Airlines flight from

Mexico City to Havana, Cuba. I would like to know what happened to

him after he arrived in Havana.

second, I would like to know what happened to the Cuban Ambassador

to Mexico City at the time of the Kennedy assassination. When was

he recalled to Havana and what positions has he held subsequent to

his recall?

Thank you for you attention to this matter. I look forward to

hearing from you soon.

ely,

Ranking Democrat

The JFK collection contains a number of documents on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez including a

small 201 file (14 pages). I have attached two documents that summarize the material on him in the

collection. I did not locate any information on Lopez's activities in Havana or his current whereabouts.

The most recent references in the collection are from 1977-79 and deal with HSCA's investigation.

There are numerous references to Joaquin Hernandez Armas, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico in

1963, in the JFK collection. Most of the documents deal with a telephone conversation between the

President of Cuba (Dorticos) and the Ambassador a few days after the assassination of JFK. I found no

information in the collection on when Hernandez Armas was recalled or subsequent positions held.

According to one document, he was still in Mexico City in June 1965.
