because in December, 1961 he was a PCI of the New Orleans
Office. A PCI file was opened on DE PHILLIPS in November,
1961 and was closed in June, 1962 after efforts had been
made to locate him since May, 1962. In attempting to find’

DE PHILLIPS for furthe# contact as a PCI it was determined |
that he ran up a number of bills in New Orleans and left the |
city. Fi |

DE PHILLIPS was living at the Mariner Hotel, 2114
Canal Street, avery low class hotel, and was hanging around piticeeit
various low class barrooms in the New Orleans French Quarter,

f Since receipt of relets,. efforts have been made to :
: locate DE PHILLIPS through pretext interviews as well as C
H through interviews with his associates and at his hangouts,
where the Agent making the inquiries identified himself as
being with the FBI. No information has been developed as to |
: DE. PHILLIPS' whereabouts, and in view of the fact that Miami {
has’ advised that he is prone to furnish false information and
is classified as a "bag of wind," no further efforts were being
made to locate him.
