Office.

A PCI file

was opened on DE PHILLIPS in November,

1961 and was closed in June, 1962 after efforts had been

made to locate him since May, 1962. In attempting to find

DE PHILLIPS for further contact as a PCI it was determined

that he ran up a number of bills in New Orleans and left the

city.

DE PHILLIPS was living at the Mariner Hotel, 211}

Canal Street, a very low class hotel, and was hanging around

various low class barrooms in the New Orleans French Quarter.

through interviews with his associates and at his hangouts,

where the Agent making the inquiries identified himself as

being with the FBI.

No information has been developed as to

DE PHILLIPS' whereabouts, and in view of the fact that Miami

has advised that he is prone to furnish false information and

is classified as a "bag of wind," no further efforts were being

made to locate him.
