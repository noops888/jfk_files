1. Here is the XUTUBS. draft caper prepared by Paul V. LEVISTER
after ‘bis recent visit ‘to youy Stition. “ it haa had the benefit of
valuable suggestions from the desk. It has been read with intereat by
senior KUBARK officers who think the paper tliustrates the essentials
o2 good tap operations. The stress. of the paper is on intelligeace
eollection, but some mention had to be ande of ovperatiousi leads and
<1/CS information, otherwise we would have had only 2 partial picture
of ine operations. fe will appreciate any comments or corrections you
wish to make. We want to present the trve facts and convey the right
iapression.

2, Having paid this tribute to honesty, we will sdmit Having
departed from the facts ia a few instances, ia the interest of sinpli-
Zicsation. One was the question of reels and transcripts, and reels
sion: (gsxes 17, 32 and 42); we did not wish to confuse the reader with
thie distinction, The other waa the collection and distributioa oi
reels and translations, which is somewhat sore complex then the
n¥aceduxe described in the text; we oreferzed not to risk losing the
reader and ourselves ia chose double and triple wingback formations
ecvied Sy Robert 3. RIGGS amd Jeremy &. NIARCOS oa theiz vay to work
ja che vorning and sometines during the cay.

2. There are a jew points on which we were not sure, for instance
‘tit Shamary account of the station's strength given on pages 46-47.

2 felt that such ca secoumt vas necessary once the reader had an idea
“2 tne size of the Operations ard the snount.of work involved; githout
wea aa .ceount be might have assumed taat the station in gvuestion was
2 Of cor very largest. “here is aisa the question of the exact
composition of tae intercept center--at tae start, and now. I7 there
iS anythiag missing {or set accurately described) that would help otaer
ations to improve their own bad dhe at this key point, we would
.ike very puch t@ put it in. . Sao eeas

4. Finally, there wae the question of the Polish lines, on whieh
Vee files are mystifying. The 1960 Project Renewal-request meations
O\@rrs sor’ desixe to cover those as well as the other two, but subse—
quent corfespoadence omits all uantion of Polish lines. Did be really _
meation the Polish target? if so, how did ve manage to get out ‘of -1t?

3, The tough problem, of course, will be to sanitize the paper
without downgrading the operations. The essence of the message is

that so much can be done, and dene well, by relatively fewrpeople
provided these few people have the right skilis and sufficient drive.
ve might omit all references to Latin Auerica, the Spanish Junguage,

and Cuban case officers; we might even throw in a few misleading phrases
like “the far-away Cuban target." We certainly would not want the
location to be recognized except by persons already familiar with the
operations. We will be guided by your wishes in this and other aspects
of the paper.
