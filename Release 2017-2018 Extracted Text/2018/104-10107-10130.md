2. A reliable source indicates that the District Attorney's

office in New York maintains a routine contact with the INTERPOL

Chief in Treasury. Mr. Hogan's officer is Cantrell. He has a

direct contact with Douglas, the INTERPOL representative in

Washington. In December 1967, the District Attorney's office

in New York City, through Cantrell, triggered an inquiry by

INTERPOL, Washington, to Scotland Yard, London, regarding

Herbert Itkin's travel from London at a particular time and on a

particular flight.

It is assumed, therefore, that the request to

also originated with hogansoffice.

Regarding Itkin's allegations of contact with the Agency

during the period 1954-1961, Mr. Sam Papich noted that the

individuals in Senator Joseph McCarthy's Investigative Staff in

1954 were:

Frank CARR

Jim GIULIANO

Don SURINE

CARR, he said, was Chief of the Investigative Staff and would certainly

have known of any contacts maintained by McCarthy under circumstances

alleged by Itkin. Mr. Papich did not know CARR's present whereabouts.

GIULIANO was an assistant. He was last reported to have been practicing

law in Washington. Both GIULIANO and CARR are quite approachable,

Mr. Papich thought. He recommended against querying Mr. SURINE.
