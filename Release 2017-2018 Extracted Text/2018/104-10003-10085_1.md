OSMW-9256 of 26 March 1964

A copy of the l January 1964 issue of SP, with the article

'La Policia de Dallas Mato a Kennedy," ("The Dallas Police Killed

Kennedy"'), is forwarded as Attachment I of this dispatch.

2. We have asked station source QUEGG/3 for a background

report on SP and its principal staff members, and will forward

it as soon as we receive it.

Meanwhile, American Embassy Madrid

Airgram 581 of 5 February 1964 described SP as Falange-oriented

and added that "since the Spanish government has close control over

the local press it is not difficult to give matters of its most

immediate interest the necessary publicity and it appears that this

campaign (on establishing Mexican/Spanish diplomatic relations) if

not supervised is at least encouraged by the Ministry of Information

or the Foreign Office."

As indicated in its masthead, SP is published both in

and in Barcelona, and its director is the Rodrigo ROYO men-

usually read SP and

is therefore not in a position to comment on its customary editorial

was made by the SP staff it was probably done because the article was

sensational enough to offer good sales prospects rather than because

that go too far beyond the censorship tabus.

the O'Brien article was published in SP it had been approved by

the Ministry of Information.

If it had not been, the issue would

not have reached the newsstands.

If the article was an anti- American propaganda plant the

two most likely points of origin would be:

a.

Movement (the other

The FalangE two members are the Carlists

and the small

remnant of the old national-syndicalist J. O. N. S.)

Movement is the only political organization legally

to exist in Spain and, as the official political unit,

major part of the structure of the Government itself.

Falange is ideologically anti-democratic, hence anti-American.

As it happens,

its outlook in this field was illustrated nicely

in this morning's issue (12 May) of Arriba, in one of the daily

editorials written by J. L. Gomez Tello:

The editorial;

entitled "A Corpse for a Democratic War," is devoted to

Defense

Secretary McNamara's current trip to South Vietnam. It says the

var is going very badly

but the Democratic Administration can't

afford to pull out of it with an election coming up.

In Arriba's

"KHANH's army is suffering heavy losses--double those of*

a few months ago.

What does this mean? A dangerous disinte

gration,

which began with the fall of President DIEM.

How will

this affect those who were rubbing their hands with glee at

the death of the only man who was galvanizing his people in

this life or death combat?

But the Western world, which wants

nothing to do with the struggle against Communism--what is it

complaining about now?

KHANH is a democratic man.

So energetic

that the most spectacular thing he has done in the past few

days has been to order

the shooting of NGO DINH CAN,

younger brother of DIEM.

The Americans turned him over to

them.

wanted to fight against Communism.)

• things for

which there seems

to be no remedy in the demoliberal philo

One of them is. (its penchant for) showing its liberalism

by offering up the anti-Communists as propitiatory victims on

the bloody altars of democracy.

Just when the ignoble term

'war criminal? a term invented by the Communists seemed to

have been forgotten on this side of the Iron Curtain, democracy

found a man to execute as such.

DIEM and his brother were

assassinated by the Communists.

And now still another has

been shot.

We feel a sensation of nausea at this conspiracy

mounted by the same ones who in the name of democracy and

'liberalism-are-opening the gates-to Communism.

A month or two ago Information Minister

incidental in his conduct of propaganda and political-action

Madrid that he personally reads and approves the major El

violent in El Espanol than in the general press.

During the

early part

of 1964,

for example,

the United States and its

government were receiving a very poor press in Spain because

of U. S. efforts to persuade Spain to drop its profitable

trade with Cuba.) . An example of the official propaganda

and approach as they tugn up in El Espanol was the

paper's farewell to the Kennedy Administration,

in an article

in the 22 February issue,

signed by one Benjamin PRICE and

entitled "DESPUES DE KENNEDY - La Nueva Frontera: Una Herencia

que"Divide a los Estados Unidos" (AFTER KENNEDY - The New

Frontier:

A Heritage which is Dividing the United States").

The article was headed by a photograph of President Kennedy,

captioned "Behind Kennedy's popularity-greater outside the

than within it were hidden the grave faults of the

Democratic Administration.'

At the beginning of the article,

in bold-face type, was a summary of the "heritage" of its

"AMERICA:

The Cuban infection is spreading to all of Spanish

America.

Castro is more dangerous than before;

the Russians have been replaced by the Chinese.

"ASIA;

Since the assassination of DIEM, Communist pressure

on South Vietnam has grown constantly; the Americans

soon will have to choose between getting out, and

fighting alone.

"EUROPE: China has in fact taken over the role of guide of •

"the new peoples' of the black Continent.

Utopians of Washington and London are

disarmament without guarantees.

Meanwhile, people

are still dying at the Berlin Wall."

The text of the article itself begins:

"The Government of President Kennedy was not a happy

government.

"Finally, it was under the Kennedy government that

America found

itself upset by civil war:

an artifically

provoked war between white and negro American citizens,.

which the negro leaders today are calling "our revolution."

"On the whole, the three years of the Kennedy Government

be judged by the historians of tomorrow

as a period of

indecision,

of confusion and of fears.

At

the moment,

the

search for

the organizer of the attack which cost the

life

of the young president has receded into the background.

And

the tragic thing? is that perhaps the American people will

never know who put the homicidal weapon into the hands of

Lee Oswald.

The Warren Commission will not complete its

work for at least a year.

And if the crime was inspired by

someone outside

the U. S. it is doubtful that the truth will

be known,

because of the international complications it

might cause.

"It is under these clouds that in the next election the

battle will be fought between the conservatives of both par-

ties, who judge the events of the Kennedy Government realisti-

cally, and the neo-republicans and democrats, who

determined to concentrate on the tragic death

of the young,:

honest but inexpert and impulsive president.."

The article continues for a total of three pages, with.

an analysis of the forthcoming election campaign, brickbats

for the Johnson Administration, etc.

analysis stresses the writer's

Goldwater as the candidate most apt to be able to defeat both

Republican and Democratic liberals.)

In attempting to obtain an up-to-date edition of the

Anuário de la Prensa Espanola as requested in reference,

we learned

new edition has come out since 1962 and only the second of

the two 1962 volumes is still available.

We are therefore forwarding

as Attachment 2 a copy of Volume 2 of the 1962 edition.
