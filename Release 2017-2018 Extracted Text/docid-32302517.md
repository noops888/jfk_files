GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.

AR

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.

on 5/3/61, l

1520 Lincoln Ave., New Kensington,

Pa. (protect per request), advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III:

The MANNARINOs have purchased some new property near Camp

Jo-An, Pa., in Westmoreland County.

A New Kensington, Pa.,

real estate agent, A. F. BOYER, handled the transaction.

on 5/3/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH:

As yet, KELLY MANNARINO has not installed a telephone at his

cottage near Leechburg, Pa., When he wishes to make a

telephone call, he goes down Old Leechburg Road about a

quarter of a mile to a Meadow Gold Dairy farm and uses a coin

telephone.

It is believed, however, that when MANNARINO

permanent summer residence at the cottage, which

is imminent, he will want a telephone installed on the

premises.

Pittsburgh will remain in contact with the local telephone

company official who can advise when a telephone application

is made by MANNARINO.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
