1964, when he arrived at London Airport from Copenhagen,

and April 16 when he left London Airport fOr Amsterdan,

Holland.

A secret and reliable source of I-l reported

that he had attended the Eighth Congress of the Interna-

tional Association o1 Democratic Lawyers (IADL) which was'

held in Budapest from March 31 to April 6, 1964. The

Continental press carried a story to the effect that he

explained his views on the Kennedy assassination and asked

the IDL to form an international committee of noted lawyers

to discover the real circumstances under which the Kennedy .

assassination

occurred.S

LANE returned to England on June 9, 1964, arriving

at London Airport from Copenhagen, Denmark.

He was ac-

companied by his fiancee,

by JAMES DELANEY GARST and at which LANE again expressed

his views on the Kennedy assassination.

reporters that BERTRAND RUSSELL had written to him to say

that he wished to form an organization in England to be

called the "Who Killed Kennedy Committee?". He went on

to say that the Committee had now been formed, without a

chairman, but with GARST as secretary. They have received

some publicity in the British press,

in particular in the

"Daily Worker" of June 12 and 30, 1964.

According to LANE,

the objects oi the committee were to collect and disseminate

all available information and evidence relating to the as-

sassination of President Kennedy and to insure justice for

the Oswald Lamily.

extent the Connittee is actively pursuing these objects.S
