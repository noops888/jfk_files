Enclosed LHM is being classified SECRET inas-

much as it contains information so classified by CIA. (4)

The Bureau will note that this case origin-

ally started out as recruiting by subjects CONSTANZO

and HEMMING of Cuban exilesafor military duty in the

Dominican Republic. It now appears that this idea has

been taken over by GUILLERMO BELT RAMIREZ and the

Comite Pro Gobierno de Cuba en el Exilio (CPCE), Miami

file 105-10238.

The Miami Office has a main case file on the

CPCE and activities of this organization have been re-

ported to the Bureau.

cave and sported no can dec

The Bureau will note that at the present time

subject ATON CONSTANZO PALAU is now a very minor figure

in this matter.

CARRILES, a CIA informant @and¿UIS SIERRA LOPEZ, a U,S. LE7, DTD. 119,4

Customs informant are also involved in this matter.

(W) EMM 639-S on July 27, 1965, reestablished con-

tact with LUIS POSADA CARRILES, and expects to be working

with him in the near futurex It is noted that POSADA is

also involved in a plot to blow up

a ship in vera. Cruz,

Mexico, and maintains contact with ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU,

a Guatemalan revolutionist in Miami. It is believed

POSADA is the main source of CIA's information in these

matters.

(9)MM 974-S, who is an older and more mature man,

with much experience in Cuban exile politics expressed

his opinion that no Cuban force will be recruited and

it is highly unlikely that GUILLERMO BELT will ever get

the support and backing of the OAS and U.S., government.

On July 25, 1965, JOSE FERNANDEZ BADUE, a

coordinator for Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE),

stated that BELT is doing nothing more than offering

an apparatus to the OAS and U.S. government, but it is

highly unlikely that this apparatus would be acceptable.

The majority of the Cuban exiles in Miami feel that this

entire matter is a waste

• of time and has no chance of

success.

The Miami Office will continue to follow the

activities of these individuals through established in-

formants and sources and will keep the Bureau advised.
