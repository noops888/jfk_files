ANTI-RACKETEERING

DATE: February 2, 1959

Re Chicago letter to the Bureau dated 12/24/58 and

Bureau routing slip dated 1/15/59.

Information contained in referenced letter and photo-

graphs of subject and his wife were furnished to Chief

Inspector JOHN PEARCE; Metropolitan Police, New Scot-

land Yard, London, England, on January 23, 1959. On

January 30, 1959, Chief Inspector PEARCE advised that

there was no record of GUS ALEX or MARIANNE ALEX in

the Central Records Office of New Scotland Yard.

There was a record, however, indicating that Gus and

ALEX left London Airport on December 22, 1950,

for Zurich, Switzerland, which indicates that these

people did visit the United Kingdom. No other infor-

mation was

available concerning them.

It is suggested that in future cases of this type

this office be advised as expeditiously as possible:

concerning travel plans of individuals planning to

visit the United Kingdom. If this office can be ad-

vised prior to the arrival of such individuals, a more

complete and thorough investigation can be undertaken

by our sources which would include Customs search,

surveillances, etc.
