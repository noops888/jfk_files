statute (28 U.S.C. 3500) may obtain prior

statements given to an IBI agent or an SEC

trvestigatory by a witness who is testitying

in a pending case; but since such statenents

night contain information unfoirly denging

to the litigant or other persons, the now

IaM, like the Jencks stetute, does not permit

the statement to be made avattable to the

publie. In addition, the House report makes

clear that litigants are not to obtain special

benctits from this provicion, stating that

'S» 1160 is not intended to give & private

party indtrectly any earlier or greater access

to investigator files than he would have di-

rectly in such Litigation or proceedings.'

Accord:

As I suggested before, Congress could not have in-

tended to grant lesser rights of inspection and

copying of vitnesses' statements to persone wino

are faced with the deprivation of their llfe or

Liberty, than to persons faced only with renedial

adninistrative orders under regulatory statutes."

424 R.2a 935, 939 (D.C. Cir.

To like effect is the Court's decision in Clenent Brothers

Co. V. VLRB, 282 Fo Suppo 540, 542 (ID Ga 1968), with which the

Ntrth Circult has stated it "fully concurs,"

HERE V. Clement

Brothes Co., 407 I aa 1027, 1031 (5th Cir: 1969);

"Though the Court does not feel that it is

necessary to reiterate en exhaustive documentation

of the Act's logislative history, the following

statement is exemplary of numerous others which

make it clear that the plaintif's interpretation

nust be rejected:

"This exemption covere investigatory flles

labor and securitios leus as well as crimi-

This vould include files prepared

In sun, it is clear that the plaintiff could

obtain the employees' statements taken by the Board

if the employees had been called to testify - in

fact, the plaintift was given access to the state-

ments of the employces who did so testify. Howevery

the plaintiff is not entitled te employee stetements

absent such use.

Since, the records plaintiff seeks have not been nade part of

the record in agency proceedings, plaintiffs may not obtain then

"absent such use." y

Aecord: Benson v. United States, 309 F.

Sup: 2144 (D Neb. 1970)*

Unlike Bristol-Myers, V. FiC, supra, there can be no serious

question that the lit records plaintill seeks are exempt tron

disclosure: they are part of an "investigative file, which was

compiled for law enforcement purposes and is mintained by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning the investigation of

the assassination of President John V. Kennedy. "

(01231 ams"

Affidavity Par. 3) -

This investigative file is not publicly

disclosed (Willians' Affidavit, Par. 4). Disclosure of such.

files would seriously hinds the operations of the FBI (Willtans"

Affidavit, Pero S). Thus, the above analysis establishes that

exemption 7 to 5 U:S.C. 552 applies to exempt the material plain-

seeke from disclosure;

In addition; the legislative history

to 5 U.S.0, 552 confirms that "It|he FBI would be protected under

exemption No. 7 prohibiting disclosure of 'investigatory files."

Remarks of Representative Gallegher, & strong supporter of the

legislation, Ö9th Cong., 2nd Sess., Cong. Record, D. 13026.

Insofar as dictun in Cooney We

Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co.,

288 F. Supp: 708 (G.D. Pa, 1966), which involved subpoene pro

ceedings, not a suit pursuant to 5 U.s.C. 552, is to the contrary,

it is plainly wrong for the reasons stated above. It is signifi-

cant that the language Congress ehose, "compiled for law enforce-

rent purposes" mas criticized at hearings on the proposed legis-

Lation as unduly restrictive. 89th Cong., Ist Session, Hearings

on Fol, 5012 before the Flouse Committee on Government Operations,

pp: 245-247 Notulthstanding this criticisn Congresa enacted

exemption 7

as referred to above because it thought the broad

protection against disclosure contained therein necessary to ef-

fective operation of the agencies thich compile investigation

reports:

In any event, the records plaintiff seels are presently

"aintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation" as investiga

tory files, (Willems. Affidavit, Pare 3)
