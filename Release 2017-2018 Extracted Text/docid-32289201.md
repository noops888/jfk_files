Remyairtels, 2/27/61, 3/9/61, and 3/16/61.

On 3/17/61, an effort to locate MORRIS SHAPIRO, aka., TOPSY,

at his residence, 3588 Beechwood Blvd, Pittsburgh, Pa., was

made by SA THOMAS G. FORSYTHXIII. An unidentified elderly man

advised that. SHAPIRO 1s

1n. Florida, address unknown, trying to

obtain employment.

On the same date, former PCI

, PIttsburgh,

advised SA FORSYTH, as follows:

He heard rumor from some gamblers at the Beacon club,

Squirrel

Hill Section,

Pitsburgh, that on the morning of 3/17/61 TOPSY

SHAPIRO was stabbed in Fla.

The extent ofhis injuries is not

known, but if true, it is believed that the assault was ordered

by the MANNARINOs because TOPSY was trying to welsh on his debt

to them.

on 3/17/61, Mrs. A.J. WISE,

JR, 811 So. Negley Ave., Pittsbrgh,

Pa., advised SA

FORSYTH that her husband, a Geological Engineer,

who is president of Kendil and Gas Co., New Kensington, Pa.,

is out of town and will not return until the end of next

week.

She feels certain he will be glad to speak with SA

FORSYTH because secretly he has

expressed some discontent

with his New Kensington business associates.
