FRANK, an oil worker from Houston, wanted to know

the

role

of the Negro in the CP. STANFORD informed the committee

that at the present there were no Negroes in the CP.

were some who read "Political Affairs" and "The Worker."

a recent, survey that he made STANFORD said

22235

There

he found out that

good number of Negroes read "New Horizons,

" "Freedom Ways"

STANFORD did not say whether the

subvey was made in San Antonio or in Houston.

There had been

other requests, he assumed them from other sources asking for

an organizer from the

national office.

(Previous to this,

FRANK had stressed the need for an importation from the

national office.,

The imports job he added would be to recruit

Negroes for membership in the CP.

Someone was needed who

could deviate his or her time to

that project.

He could

not do

he didn't have the time.

In fact he'dibe suspicious if

he lingered too long talking to a Negro at his job. FRANK said

he felt SMITH would meet with CP

personnel if he was

correctly

approached. FRANK admitted that SMITH was

scared.)

AUGUSTIN ESTRADA said he could spend a week end

talking to some of the folks he knew.

JOE LANDIN said he agreed

with FRANK,

someone was needed full time to do the job. BIll

LOWERY and JOHN STANFORD figured the best thing to do was for

them to do that job themselves..

STANFORD explained that he

based the deductign on the fact that there was no contact with

the national office. The last contact had been made a year

280. 406)(4)

Informant further determined that FRANK told JOHN

STANFORD

that he suspected a Negro of being a spy. The man

had been asking questions about him and had just happened to

be on the same train with

"POLLY" when she passed by there

(sometime ago.

This man has a railroad card which entitles

hit

him to free rides. K(%)U)

BILL LOWERY made a report on the PENN JONES case.

there would be

(students who, as a captive audience in a Midlothian school,

heard

conservative speak and hadnot been given a chance to

hear a liberal.

The form of action to be taken,

he added,

would be up to PENN. JONES.

The Birchers, he concluded, were

taking over the PlAs. (4) (u)

JOE LANDIN reported that he had joined the local

and had

learned that on Monday the union was to file a sut

suit in court in favor of REEDER, a teacher who was fined for

lending his support to sit in demonstrations

LANDIN also

reported on PASO and the NAACP, LANDIN explained that in 1954

and 1961 local

labor people had not been wise in selecting

Individuals to lead Latin-Americans.

The ir present selectee

in spite of an "Uncle Tommish" name and some chauvenistic

characteristics, had turned out to be a good working liberal,

no

less.

The CP, he suggested, should work closer with him.

The NAACP, JOE explained, had only 281 members and for awhile

It seemed that the NAACP youth council's sefior advisor had

become an opportunist after being financially rewarded for

after being f.

campaigning for WILL WILSON, She (J. E. CRAFT) had started

to make an independent organization out

of the youth council

to be more active in politics..

The advisor had also started a

precinct Club.

It seems that

the NAACP's national convention

had done a lot of good because she pledged to work harder than

ever and she was doing just that.

Informant further determined that JOHN STANFORD

the people were no longer

afraid. He had invited 40 persons to see a movie on the

Russia, 29 adults had attended paying a dollar for

admission. THEO added that a Negro head of the Young Democrats

had been impeached by Anglos for not being active.

" While

the

impeachment proceedings were illegal, and whether he had been

impeached or not, all this indicated they wanted action.

STANFORD added that while people were not afraid they would not

mate neond be not

speak out.

There was the case of Prof. KOENINGER,

, the McCarren

Act - no one complained.

It was up to them to show the people

that the persecution of the Texas Party was tied in with the
