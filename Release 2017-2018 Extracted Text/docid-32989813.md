vities in a lengthy interview:.

He detailed

a number of the

groups actiyities including:

Conducting a reign of terror

against the left in a series of attacks

including bombings, burglaries and

harassment.

-Plotting the assassinations: of

President Richard M. Nixon and sev;

-Shooting into the home of a

Marxist college prolessor, wounding

a woman guest,

- Stealing membership, files, and

college professors Angela Davis and Herbert Marcuse in

hem off the bridge, over San Diego's Highway 395 was

Godfrey said he was convinced the assassination plots

could have been carried out, but "I talked it down to pre-

cuse and Davis) martyrs.

Godfrey implicated a San Diego County, superyisor, Lou

Conde; in the effigy-hanging, scheme. Conde admitted it

was his idea,, but he denied any connection with the Min-

utemen or any. assassination plots.. Conde-also admitted

participating in another "prank" with Godirey, on the

Peace and Freedom;party.

The most violent of the groups, was the Secret Army

Organization, which Godfrey said he cofounded with Jer-

fy. Lym Davis in 1971 after the demise of the Minutemen?

faction in San Diego.

The Minutemen began to die out "partially because y

wasn't putting in as much effort to keep them going as T

probably should have," Godirey admitted.

began to pick up," he said.

" "The FBI was definitely interested in my participating

The position of the BI in all his activities was, "Stay,

in any llegal acuvities and encouraged to prevent as

Citing his role of leadership, he described his plight: n

"He toid me he hid it to protect me because of the con

vention, because he couldn't afford to lose me. He was

setting pressure from work to preserve me," Godfrey said

cident, corroborated Godfrey's tale.

"I was instructed it was imperative to preserve God

frey," he said. "It was my own decision to hide the gun

I don't think I did anything morally wrong." He said

his possession of the weapon

"was not that secretive"

around the local office.

An FBI spokesman in Washington, D.C., said, "There

was no instruction we're aware of to Christianson to keep

the gun."

/ Christianson said that at all times, "officials inside and

ject, no evidence to identify a suspect," said Hoobler.

'They (FBI) had the evidence. They knew we were inves-

ng:. not having the total information for a six-monthl

period severely limited our bringing a suspect to justice."

( A district attorney's spokesman said, "Homicide detail

broke their backs trying to investigate that case. They

vere told explicitly that the informer was not available,

that they could not interview him or have his identity."

Clark Brown, former assistant agent in charge of the

San Diego FBI office, denied the FBI obstructed the po

ice investigation.

"We gave officers investigating the case all the infor-

nation we had... and we said we would reveal the in-

ormer only if they couldn't establish a case without him,

The first break in the shooting case came in June, 1972

He said he told the FBI that Yakopec was dangerous

had explosives and had threatened to blow up so-called

"pornography" targets--theaters and a bookstore and a

massage parlor.

This information is verified in an FBI report on the

SAO dated Feb. 21, 1973.

Godfrey was never prosecuted for any of his aclivities,

although "I had to itemize my activities for the district at-

torney's office and when he (the prosecutor) saw that ligt,

he heured i'd be the easiest one of the bunch to prosectite."

Clash at Hearing.

BY RONALD J. OSTROW

Times Stalf Writer

WASHINGTON-A Senate com-

mittee hearing on the FBI erupted:

Thursday into angry accusations.or

jarrogance between Sen. Walter F.

Mondale (D-Minn.) and Atly. Gen.!

Edward H. Levi over Levi's reluc-l

lance to turn over reports of current!

FBI misconduct.

The heated exchange took place!

after

Mondale had

criticized

"vaguely defined" a draft of guide-!

lines for the FBI's controversiall

domestic security investigations that;

Levi and his aides have worked on;

for eight months.

The guideline, draft, which Levi

made public later Thursday, marks:

the most sweeping attempt lo date?

by an attörney general to set stan-

dards for the FBI to follow in the'

sensitive security field. They would

involve the Justice Department far!

more deeply in FBI affairs than has

been the case in the past.

Mondale-touched off the-heated-ex-

change by asking Levi for copies off

reports to FBI Director Clarence M.

Kelley on conduct by agents and

bureau programs that could raise

iquestions.

Jevi-That I don't know about.

Mondale-But I'm asking you as

head of the Justice Department if we

can get those reports.

Levi-Well, I don't know whether!

you can or not...

Mondale-Why not?

• Levi Because I think il's

one

thing to give reports of that kind in:

confidence.to a committee of this:

kind and another thing to make them j

public.

Mondale The CIA gave theirs to

us. Why can't you?

Levi-Well, I'm not in. the CIA.

Don't care to be. Don't wish to be.

At tbat-point, Sen. Frank Church

(D-Ida.), chairman of the Senate In-

telligence Committee, attempted to

intervene but Levi interrupted, say-

* apologize to Sen. Mondale if I

appeared arrogant. I thought some-

body else was appearing arrogant,

but I apologize."

Levi said he was concerned about

releasing internal FBI reports be-

'cause if agents believe that reports of

misconduct they submit are going to

be made public, "that, I believe,

would be very chilling."

Levi then said he had no reason to

withhold the information if it would

not be made public, but added that

ne wanted to check first with the FBI.

"My relationship with the bureau is

that I like to discuss these matters

with them before giving definitive

answers because I'm not that arro-

gant," he said:

. .

The draft guidelines provide that

the FBI will conduct domestic securi-

ty investigations only "when there is

a likelhood that the activities of indi-

viduals or groups involve the use of.

force or violence in violation of fed-

eral law."

The investigations would be limit-

ed to activities that aim to overthrow

federal or state governments, inter-

fere with foreign government offi-

cials within the United States, in:

fluence government policies by inter-

fering with force or violence, deprive

persons of their civil rights or create

believe that the individual or group

the outlawed acts.

In the controversial area of coun-

terintelligence steps, the draft guide-

lines would permit

"preventive ac-

tion," but they would be limited to

nonviolent emergency measures au-

thorized by the attorney general.

The guideline draft drew praise

from Church and Sen. Philip A. Hart

(D-Mich.), but both had extensive

questions.

Mondale said he thought the guide-

lines would not stand up under "di-

r'éct orders to the contrary" from a

President or "a williul (FBI) director

who was angry or hostile or suspi-

cious about some of these political

ideas- the next Martin Luther King."

"What we decide to do cannot be

tested by the words, but by our no-

tion of how human nature works

when empowered in this way to play

God with

the American

people,'

Mondale said.

pens when the nation is in frenzy

Mr. ADAMS and reviewing the actual testimony received in

I advised these gentlemen that I was aghast when I

read the headlines and the lead paragraph of this article

and could not believe that JIM ADAMS did not refute infornant

ROWE's testimony that we took no action relative to con..

templated violence since I knew that this was contrary to

because,

according to ADAMS, he completely refuted these

statements in that we did disseminate the contemplated

plans of violence to the Birmingham Police Department and

to the Department of Justice in the form of a letterhead

memorandum.

I continued that I waited until I received the

actual transcript of testimony and told the gentlemen that

upon my review of the testimony of Mr. ADAMS and Mr. WANNALI,

I could not reconcile the headline and lead paragraph with

such testimony. I then proceeded to read several excerpts

from the

testimony.

I advised Mr. THOMAS and Mr. GUTHMAN that my

to prepare a "'Letter to the Editor"

but telt atter a re-analysis of the situation that this is

not a judgment question on the part of the newspaper, but

one of a slanted, inaccurate story either by design or

through misunderstanding. I therefore felt that the Los

Angeles Iimes.,

if it so

desired, should be in a position to

correct the situation itself based on the facts.

Mr. THOMAS expressed appreciation for my approach

and stated that at the time he read the article, already

printed, a question came to his mind as to why the FBI did

not advise someone or take some action relative to contemplated

violence.

He, however, took no further action. He said

In view of what I had read from excerpts of Mr. ADAMS!

and the now available complete transcript of the testimony,

he intends to pursue this matter further and would prefer

not to have a "letter to the Editor"

, but rather correct

any inaccuracies on the part of the Los Angeles Times through

their own pursuit of further inquiring concerning this story.

Mr. GUTHMAN concurred with Mr. THOMAS and they

Indicated that it appears the obvious question is based on

testimony of who in the Department of Justice

received this information relative to contemplated violence

and what did such a responsible Department of Justice official

do with the information. He agreed that based on the

information furnished to them, the FBI has been done an

injustice but that they, the Los Angeles Times, desired to

It should be noted the article of JACK NELSON is

based on one specific situation, namely the testimony of

former informant GARY ROWE that he had furnished advance

information to the FBI to the effect that members of the

Ku Klux Klan would be given the opportunity to beat members

of the Freedom Riders without interference by law enforcement

authorities for approximately 15 minutes after which the

local law enforcement authorities would take action, and

that the FBI was advised of this well in advance of

such

beatings and furthermore, the FBI took no action to prévent

this violençe.

At 1:20 PM, I advised Mr. ADAMS of the results of the

conference and alerted him to the possibility of being

contacted by JACK NELSON for further elaboration as to who

was notified in the Department of Justice of the contemplated

violence and what action, if we knew such an individual,

took concerning this information.

Mondale criticized the FBI for trying to "protect people

it was "virtually inconceivable" that

DeLoach, who headed the public relations arm of the

FBi and served as liaison to the White House during the

¿Johnson administration, was questoned about a survei!

lance team he headed at the 1964 Democratic convention

in Atlantic City.

DeLoach said the purpose of the eifort, which included

wiretapping, was to gather intelligence on any "strife"

that might erupt. He rejected Smothers' description of the

surveillance as a political intelligence effort, saying. "We

passed on all information we received. I'm not a politician.

The committee report on the operation noted that infor-

mation relayed included "the most sensitive details of the

plans and tactics. of persons supporting the Mississipp

Freedom Democratic Party delegate challenge." This was

"the most important single issue that might have dis-

zurbed President Johnson.

As the questioning grecome, deati eured al

aside by volunteering that the FBI team's presence at the

convention resulted from President Johnson's "obsession"

"FBl agents for the first time found themselves as bo.

dyguards on street corners with Secret Service agents,"

Another former fbi oiticial told the committee that

Atty. Gen. Kennedy authorized a 30-day "trial" telephone

tap of King in October, 1963, but that it continued for five

years until King was assassinated in 1968.

the taps simply continued.

Committee member Gary Hart (D-Colo.) said that dur-

ing the 1964 Democratic convention at Atlantic City FBI

agents were furnished NBC television press credentials

through the cooperation of NBC officials and newsmen.

DeLoach confirmed the account but said he did not

snow how the credentials were used

• In his testimony, Katzenbach drew a picture of Hoover

as a man who held "conservative views" and as he "grew

older and the country changed-for the worse, in his

view— the intensity of those feelings and the irustrations

at what was taking place grew."

of FBI agents.

Later at a Washington news conference, Hoover called

King a "notorious liar" and threw in a trash basket notes

Mr.

By William Safire

WASHINGON, Nov. 19-On Oct. 10,

1963, the then-Attorney General of the

United States put his personal signa-

ture on a document that launched and

legitimatized one of the most horren-

dous abuses of Federal police power in

this century.

In Senator Frank Church's subcom-

mittee hearing room this week, the

authorized wiretapping and subse-

quent unauthorized bugging and at-

tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther

King Jr. is being gingerly examined,

with the "investigation" conducted in.

such

a way

as not to unduly em-

barrass officials of the Kennedy or

Church's Cover-Up

The committee is not asking embar-

rassing questions even when answers

are

readily available. A. couple of

weeks ago, at an.open hearing, an

F.B.I. man inadvertently started to

blurt out an episode about newsmen

who were weritapping in 1962 with

- the apparent knowleage of Attorned

General Kennedy. The too-willing wit,

less was promptly shooshed into sl

lence, and told that such information

would be developed only in executive

• session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern of containment by the

Church committee is. vividly shown by

the handling of the buggings at the

1964 Republican and Democratic con-

ESSAY

Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has

focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when s

the committee counsel first set forth

the result of shuffling through press

clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-j

partment had existed in 1962; today,

an F.B.I. Witness pointed out that it

was Robert Kennedy who authorized

the wiretap of Dr. King, and that "the

President of the United States and the

Attorney General specifically discussed

their concern of Communist influence

with Dr. King."

But the Church committee showed

no zest for getting further to the Ken-

nedy root of this precedent to Water-

gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church

were willing to let the chips fall where

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-

don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-

cal headquarters. were worse than the

crime committed at Watergate, since

they involved the use

of the 'F.B.I.,

but the Church investigators seem to

be determinet not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.l. documents say that reports

were made to specific Johnson aides,

why are those men not given the

same opportunity, to publicly tell their

story so avidly given the next Presi-

dent's men? If Lyndon Johnson com-

mitted this impeachable high crime of

using the f.B.I. to. spy on political

ward to tell us all about it?

they may, he would call some knowl-

edgeable witnesses into the glare of

the camera lights and ask them some

FBI 'Degenerate'

BY PAUL HOUSTON

Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON-A former FBI intelligence agent

Tuesday called the FBI "a degenerate dictatorship" under

which agents, out of blind loyalty, condone unethical anc

illegal activities within the bureau.

Arthur Murtagh, who retired in 1971 after 20 years ir

the bureau, broke into.tears several times as he made the

sweeping charges before the House Intelligence Commit.

tee.

Later he exchanged angry shouts with the committee's

top-ranking. Republican,, Rep. Robert McClory. of Illinois

when McClory demanded more specifics and challenged

Murtagh's claim' that "hundreds" of agents had quit the

FBI in disgust.

Murtagh did supply details of some things that he saic

the knew about personally. He cited. the leaking of wiretar

information on the late Dr. Martin Luther King, hiring

discrimination against blacks and liberals, the harsh disci.

plinary practices of the late FBI director J. Edgar Hoover;

the blackmailing of a Midwestern senator and an attempt.

•led dirt trick against Ren. Andrew Young (D.Ga),

\ However, Murtagh said he thought that it was a "rari

ty" for the FBI to use agents provocateurs- that is, intor

mants who help the FBI entrap persons in illegal activity.

The FBI had no comment on Murtagh's testimony.

Meanwhile, FBI officials appeared before the committee

and strongly defended the bureau against charges.by_othe

er witnesses that members of such groups as the Socialist

Workers Party and the Institute for Policy Studies had

been unduly harassed, wiretapped, burgled and tailed.

Asst. FBI Director James B. Adams raised the possibili-

ty of terrorists bringing "fireworks" to the nation's bicen-

tennial celebration next year and pleaded that the FBI'S

domestic intelligence "flexibility" be preserved.

He suggested that congressional monitoring of the FBI

might be accomplished by creation of a special Senate.

House committee,

In other testimony, the committee, headed by Rep. Otis

G. Pike (D-V.Y.), heard a Camden, N.J., contractor tell of

serving as an FBI agent provocateur in a raid on draft;

board offices by an antiwar group in 1971:-

The contractor, Robert Hardy, said he was not proud of

his role. He said he began as an FBI tipster and wound up

as the protest group's leader, taking instructions from FBI

agents.

He taught the group of professors, students and clergy

how to cut glass and open windows noiselessly, rented

trucks, obtained floor plans-and taught fast ladder

climbing and safe roof walking.

"My neighbors began to wonder why I had this crowd

of people climbing up the side of my house and parading

along the edge of my roof every day," Hardy said. "I be-

gan to feel like the Pied Piper."

Members of the group were arrested as they attempted

o preak into ine drait board offices. Later all were ac

ouitted.

Murtagh, who was assigned to the FBI's internal securi-

ty intelligence squad in Atlanta for 10 years, said he often

refused to participate in questionable bureau activities.

For example, shortly after Young, a civil rights leader,

announced his candidacy for Congress, Murtagh said he

was asked to obtain handwriting samples of several of

Young's associates in King's Southern Christian Leader-

ship Conference.

Murtagh said he told his supervisor that he "knew

damn.well it was going to be used in a counterintelligence

operation to destroy Mr. Young's chances of getting elect-

ed to the House of Representatives."

Murtagh said his supervisor's reaction was: "Now, don't

get excited, Art, we will manage some other way."

Young won the election.

Murlagh charged that the incident showed how preju-

dice against.blacks.and liberals had pervaded the FBI and

affected its operations.

As another example he cited the leaking to the press of

personal information on King and others. "The leaked in

formation always seemed to involve persons of libera

persuasion," Murtagh said. "From my years in the bureau

I can only assume that the bureau had deduced that per.

sons of liberal persuasion are somenow more apt to sleep

with somebody else's wife, drink too much liquor or b

sexually perverted than are solid conservatives.'

In this connection, Murtagh related that a former top

FBI official, Cartha DeLoach, once told him and other

agents that the bureau had blackmailed a Midwestern

senator who Mau been picked up for arunken, hit-and-run

driving in the company of an attractive blonde.

"DeLoach told us that by noon of the next day the sen-

ator was aware we had the information, and we've never

had-any-problem with him on appropriations since," Mur-

tagh related.

le said the bureau's main problems stemmed fro

oover's practices of hiring people "who were political

disposed to the right, as he was," providing no grievance

Drocedures and imposing harsh discipline.

"issued but that it chose not to do so. It gave the fonowing

the the net are i of a criminal perlientle would be to

rious problem," the grand jury said. "The grand jury chose

to submit a report, instead, to alert the public against

such excessive abuse in the future," said State's Atty. Ber-

Mard Carey, a Republican, who was responsible for the in-

• yestigation.

Carey said that a sealed list of 13 police officers who

liad acted illegally had been delivered to the city's. current

police superintendent, James M. Rochfora.

Rochford said Monday," If Carey had any evidence of

wrongdoing, he should have indicted." He added that the

I report vindicated his department. Speaking of the 21 Chi-

cago policemen who, Carey said, had taken the Fifth

Amendment before the grand jury, Rochford said, "They

• just took the protection they were entitled to."

The Democratic mayor of Chicago, Richard J. Daley,

has consistently defended the Police Department's infiltra-

tion of political groups as necessary to prevent terrorist

acts. Chicago's city government hired two criminal law-

•yers to represent the police officers called before the

grand jury.

"The overwhelming weight of the evidence presented to

this grand jury clearly established that the true motiva-

fion for spying on community groups was political," the

report stated. It added that the groups infiltrated "at o

ne-or-änother were critical of the policies of the may

of Chicago." Daley was mayor during the period covered

by the grand jury investigation.

Kelley Says Probes

Could Cripple FBi

BY RONALD J. OSTROW

Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON-FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley

raised this specter Tuesday: that congressional investiga:

tions and news media interest in the bureau could benefit

"domestic estremists and foreign agents."

Kelley's comments, in a speech to the Lubbock (Tes.)

Chamber of Commerce that was made available here;

marked his strongest and most direct attack on the vari-

ous congressional investigations of the FBI.

"Impartial inquiry and evaluation of national security.

are considerably different from the relentless bombard.

ment we have been subjected to in the public.forum for

so many months," Kelley said. "The danger is that exces-

sive restraints crippling. to pur domestic securty efforts

could be imposed on us."

Kelley's remarks coincide with personnel shifts in the

intelligence agencies that some members of Congress

think signal reduced cooperation betiveen these agencies

and the investigating committees.

Robert J. Havel, director of public information for the

Department of Justice, sair that Kelley'e speech hau iri

been cleared in advance with his office and that it was

not the department's practice to require such clearance.

A White House spokesman gave a similar reply, saying:

"It's a solo effort."

Kelley's comments constituted a plea for public support.

"We are concerned that the highly publicized scrutiny

ind criticism of our domestic intelligence operations in re-

sent months will undermine the trust Americans tradi-

ionally have placed in the FBI," he said. "We must con-

inue to have that trust if we are to function effectively in

he future."

Kelley said that the FBI has been devoting "an appreci:

ble amount of resources" to research and preparation of

etailed reports for congressional testimony "to the des

riment of more productive investigative activities."

There are now at least 12 congressional investigations

wvolving the FBI.

"Perhans our operations will derive benefit from the un.

recedented surge ot..news media and official Interest in

he FBI,'Kelley said."

RE: INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J.

On September 23, 1975,

Senate Select Committee (SSC)

Staff Member Michael T. Epstein interviewed Special Agent in

Charge Ralph J. Rampton in the building

located across C Street

from the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.,

in the presence of Staff Member Mary De Oreo, who took notes

for Mr. Epstein.

The interview began at 1:37 pm, and concluded

at 3:07 pm.

At the outset of the interview Mr. Rampton was

signatures of Mr. Rampton, Miss De Oreo and Mr. Epstein is

attached.

Following the signing of the Advice of Rights Form

the interview began with Mr. Epstein requesting Mr. Rampton to

briefly review his assignments in the Bureau, beginning with

his assignment to the Communist Front Unit at Bureau Headquarters

in 1960.

After Mr. Rampton gave this background information

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton to read a FBI memorandum dated

October 22, 1962, relating to the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC). This memo in essence recommended approval

of a Communist infiltration investigation of the SCLC and

proposed sending a letter to the New York and Atlanta Offices,

believed dated October 23, 1962, instructing those offices to.

begin investigation.

Mr. Epstein was interested in the reasons

and the background which prompted the recommendation for this

investigation. He asked Mr. Rampton if those initials (RJR)

on the two documents represented Mr. Rampton as the dictator.

Mr. Rampton replied they were his initials and that he recalled

writing these documents.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton how he obtained

information to compose these documents which indicate Stanley

David Levison, a secret member of the Communist Party (CP) and

Hunter Pitts O'Dell, a member of the National Committee of

the CP were associated with Dr. Martin Luther King, head of

the SCIC.

Mr. Rampton replied

he could not specifically recall

how the information came to his attention, but that it would

be normal for him to receive reports from various sources,

such as field offices and other units at the Bureau which may

have referred to the association of Dr. King with CP members.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether the Bureau reguired

field offices to report on racial incidents, such as sit-ins,

and Mr. Rampton replied field offices were normally required

to report any incidents of civil strife which would be disseminated

to appropriate agencies of the Executive Branch such as the

Department of Justice and the White House.

The context of

this question was whether reporting on racial incidents might

influence Mr. Rampton or other Bureau officials to focus

attention on the SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King. Mr. Rampton

told Mr. Epstein such matters would not normally come to his

attention and the thing that focused Mr.. Rampton's attention

on the SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King was information which

at tempts to donna e

indicated CP attempts to dominate or influence DI. King and the

SCL.C.

Mr. Rampton told Mr. Epstein he was not in sympathy

with this inquiry by the SSC and that while he would cooperate,

he desired to point out the inquiry was reducinc

the effectiveness of the FBI. Mr. Rampton pointed out the FBI

does not need additional legislation or rules to circumscribe

its efforts in that the policy of the Bureau has

always been

to protect the rights of citizens and Communist infiltration

investigations are very carefully supervised, stringently.

circumscribed and limited in scope to determine the degree

of infiltration or influence subversive organizations have

on legitimate organizations.

Mx. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether Mr. Rampton

was

aware of such matters as sit-ins, racial incidents and

so forth. Mr. Rampton replied that he read the newspapers

and may have seen memoranda which incidentally referred to

such information, but that it was not the area of Mr. Rampton's

specific interest in the Communist Front Unit and that

Mr. Rampton, as a member of that Unit, was required to review

all reports that might indicate CP or other subversive

organizational activities wherever they might occur.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton the purpose of

Communist infiltration investigations whereupon he showed

Mr. Rampton copies of pages containing specific references

from Section 87E of the FBI Manual of Instructions which

contain FBI policy concerning Communist

infiltration investigations.

Mr. Rampton explained to Mr. Epstein that the purpose of the

Communist infiltration investigation was to determine whether

or not the CP was dominating or influending a legitimate

organization, such as the SCLC. Mr. Rampton explained these

investigations had to be authorized by the Bureau, that the

field did not have the prerogative to begin these investigations,

and that such investigations were strictly limited in scope.

Mr: Rampton explained that it is not now and was not then

permissible to develop informants and sources in the legitimate

organization, but that sources were developed in the subversive

organization, which

i was infiltrating the legitimate organization.

Mr. Epstein asked if it was permissible to direct these

sources to join the legitimate organization and Mr. Rampton

replied that it was

not permissible to do so; however, if the

sources were invited to join, the handling Agent had to avoid

any direction of the source's activities in the legitimate

organization, which would influence the normal activities of

the legitimate organization.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

(SSC) ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J.

RAMPTON BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

•Mr. Epstein asked if the ultimate objective of

the Communist infiltration investigation would be to make

the organization a Communist front so that an all out

investigation could be conducted. Mr. Rampton replied this

was not

the objective, but if, in effect, the CP or other

subversive organization reached the point where it controlled

and directed the activities of the legitimate organization,

it was conceivable the organization would then be considered

a Communist front and become of wider investigative interest

to the FBI. Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton if he could

recall any legitimate organizations becoming front

organizations through infiltration.

Mr. Rampton replied he

could not recall specifically, but did not rule out this

had occurred in some instances.

Mr. Epstein directed

attention to

a memorandum

written in June 1962 by deceased Agent William Forsyth, which

memorandum instructed Atlanta and New York to remain alert

to Communist attempts to influence the SCLC. Mr. Epstein

asked if Mr. Rampton knew Mr, Forsyth and was aware of that

memorandum which also mentioned and was possibly captioned

Stanley David Levison and Hunter Pitts O'Dell. Mr. Rampton

advised he could not remember Mr. Forsyth, but the name seemed

vaguely familiar and could not remember the memorandum itself

but could not rule out the possibility of having read it.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether this memorandum might

have contained the basis for Mr. Rampton preparing the

memorandum of October 22, 1962, to recommend the Communist

infiltration investigation of the SCIC.

Mr. Rampton replied

he could not be sure since he could not remember the

memorandum specifically.

There was a reference in Mr. Rampton's memorandum

of October 22, 1962, to the effect information had been received

the CP may be exerting an influence on the SCLC and then later

in the same paragraph a reference to the CP connection of

Levison and O'Dell who were associated with Dr. King.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether the first reference

was roughly equivalent to the second reference. Mr. Rampton

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

RE:

INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J.

RAMPTON BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

advised he could not be sure since he could not recall what

was available to him in 1962 which led to the phraseology

mentioned above.

A reference was made in one of the documents which

apparently was a letter to Atlanta and New York written

in 1962 requesting these offices to review files and make

recommendations to the Bureau concerning a Communist infiltration

investigation of the SCLC.. Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton

whether this amounted to an instruction to the field to

make a positive recommendation to investigate the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton replied it was not an instruction to the field

to make a positive recommendation; that what Mr. Rampton

obviously had in mind was to determine the facts from the

field reports; and to analyze the facts then decide whether

to recommend an investigation be instituted. Mr. Epstein

indicated he believed such terminology was tantamount to an

instruction to the field to come back with a positive

recommendation and it would be unlikely the field would come

back with

à negative set of facts.

Mi. Rampton said this

was an unjustifiable conclusion and if Mr. Epstein understood

Bureau terminology he would realize the field would have

recommended action according to the facts at hand.

Mr. Epstein

asked whether conferences were held by Mr. Rampton and other

Bureau Officials which resulted in focusing attention on

the SCLC and Dr. King. Mr. Rampton replied he could not

recall any conferences which would have resulted in a decision

to focus attention on the SCLC or DI. King, but that it was

possible reports received from the field which indicate CI

influence with Dr. King would have been discussed with members

of the Communist Front Unit. In any event Mr. Rampton

said the review of reports from various sources was a

continuing assignment and when Mr. Rampton became aware of

CP influence on the SCLC it was his job to analyze this and

present a recommendation which had to be approved at a

higher level for a Communist infiltration investigation of

the SCIC.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether he had

ordered disruptive techniques to be used against the SChC.

Mr. Rampton replied that he had not and wouldn't have done

so since the SCIC was a legitimate organization.

Mr. Epstein

asked if Mr. Rampton had engaged in COINTELPRO activities

RE: INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J. RAMPTON

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

in regard to this or other investigations and Mr. Rampton

replied that he was not cleared to discuss COINTELPRO with

Mr. Epstein.

Mr. Epstein referred to a wiretap on DI. King

and asked Mr. Rampton whether he could have authorized such

hampton shether

an unusual technique when he first made the recommendation

for the Communist infiltration investigation of the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton told Mr. Epstein he had no personal information

concerning the "so-called" wiretap on Dr. King (MI. Epstein

advised Mr. Rampton such a wiretap was authorized in connection

with the Communist infiltration investigation of the SCLC

in October 1963.), but in any event wiretaps had to be

approved by the

• Attorney General and sufficient information

would have to be available to justify asking the Attorney

General for such authorization.

The facts which existed

in October 1962 were not supportive of such a reguest;

Mr. Rampton pointed out.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether or not

DI. King was on the

Reserve Index or Security Index when the

Communist infiltration investigation was ordered.

Mr. Rampton

repliéa thai he was not aware of any such designation

fOI

DI. King.

Mr. Epstein asked whether COINTELPRO operations

were considered concerning the SCLE and then he added he

would not get into this area, after looking at the memoranda

before him, because it was "after Mr. Rampton's time."

This was a reference to the fact that Mr. Rampton was

transferred from the Communist Front Unit in late 1962:

Enclosed herewith for the Bureau is the original

and seven copies of letterhead memorandum dictated by

took place at Mr. PONDER's home at San Clemente.

Mr. PONDER dictated the following impressions

for the Bureau's information:

"Following this interview and upon further

reflection I believe Atlanta did have some coverage on

KING at the time I arrived in Atlanta. I believe that

coverage was on his home as opposed to the coverage on

his offices at Southern Christian Leadership Conference

which we obtained while I was there.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

1776-1970

55235

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike

Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee.

said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day

weekend and asked whether I would be available for

interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.

Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed

to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,

August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between

3:40 pm and 4:05 pm.

This included the time spent in

amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked

during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge

in Atlanta.

I told him from April or May 1964 to

December 1966.

He asked where I had been assigned before

that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta

(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau

He asked if I were aware of telephone taps

maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.

I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and

removed during my tenure in Atlanta.

He asked if there

were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told

him I was not aware of any. In response to these and

other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that

I had

not been personally involved in the King matter,

that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and

that after ten years I cannot now clearly

recall information

which might answer his questions., I told him that every-

thing that was done was properly recorded, that the

records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs

from the record, he should rely on the record to determine

what happened.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the king

coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told

him I did not recall, but that in any case it was

approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored

and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment

rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in

which the apartment was

rented and I said I did not.

He

asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I

do not now recall whether I was told why they were

discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the

He asked whether

we had a bug on King as opposed

tap and I told him, "no."

He asked whether it were

possible there were taps and bugs placed and maintained

without my knowledge.

I told him that was not possible

because of the size of the office and the relationship

I had with the supervisors and

Agents that nothing was

done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any

Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled

none.

He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent

King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere

with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a

banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.

I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director

William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him

Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional

conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the

Klan. He

wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan

and I told him I thought so.

'He asked who else had

accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had

accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name

I cannot now recall.

He asked whether Sullivan had met

with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta

Constitution).

I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,

that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,

but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

He asked

the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a

meeting took place it was in the nature of a social

call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a

public: relations-type of meeting.

He asked whether there

was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding

any anti-king activities and I told him, "no."

He asked

whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta

and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry

made by the Bureau into the handling of the King

investigation either through the Inspection Staff or

otherwise.

I told him I was not aware of any. He asked

whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King

investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I

told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not

recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.

I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was

still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had

supervised the security Squad. I told him supervisor

Charles Harding.

In a friendly conversation that followed

fox approximately ten to fifteen minutes, SA Ward

advised Seidel that he had only been assigned the

months and had no knowledge that would be of value

to Seidel. The Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter

was not further discussed.

Palos Verdes, and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.

SA Ward advises that he is aware that the

Director waived his employment agreement with certain

exceptions regarding privileged areas.

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

1776-1978

55235

On August 5, 1975, Supervisor Richard H: Bloeser

was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel at the

Los Angeles FBI Office regarding the COINTELPRO/Black Panther

Party (BPP) .

Mr. Seidel advised Supervisor Bloeser that the

interview was voluntary, but did not advise Supervisor

Bloeser of his rights in this matter.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Supervisor Bloeser as to

how many offices he had served in, his length of service in

the Bureau, and how long had been spent on intelligence

investigations.

Supervisor Bloeser replied that he had

served in Philadelphia, El Paso and Los Angeles, had been

in the Bureau approximately 24½-years, and had been assigned

to intelligence work for 22 years.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Supervisor Bloeser

believed that the Bureau had placed undue pressure on the

field to come up with counter intelligence proposals concerning

the BPP and was it difficult to come up with a proposal.

Supervisor Bloeser responded that there was no undue pressure

placed on the field uy thé Bufau, that the CUINTELPRO/BPP

was merely another case assigned to an agent and that agent,

as in any other case, had the responsibility of handling the

matter whether it concemed the solving of a case or the

submission of proposals. •Mr.-Seidel was also informed that

it was not unduly difficult tö come üp with a proposal and that

a number of proposals were rejected at the field level and

never submitted to the Bureau:

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically as to counter

intelligence proposals involving cartoons ridiculing the BPP.

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely remembered such

proposals but without reviewing the file had no definite

recollection. Mr. Seidel did not request that the file be

reviewed.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically about a business

card which allegedly had been prepared by the Bureau bearing

the phrase "Karenga is impotent."

Mr. Seidel requested

Supervisor Bloeser's views on the distribution of this cara

by the FBI. Supervisor Bloser responded that he

vaguely

remembered the card, that he thought it was humorous, and

that the word impotent had various meanings.

Mr. Seidel then inquired about the blood feud

which existed in the past between the US Organization and

the BPP and the efforts of the Bureau to keep this feud

alive and thus promote violence.

He specifically inquired

as to the personal feelings of Supervisor Bloeser concerning?

any counter intelligence proposals which, if placed in

operation, could lead to violence between the two groups.

Supervisor Bloeser responded first that personally

he had no apologies for the counter intelligence program as

a whole, that proposals submitted six or seven years.ago. is wi

were believed necessary at that time due to the circumstances;

specifically that at that time the BPP 'and the US Organizatin

were involved in violent activity against the community as a

whole: Mr. Seidel was informed that the feud between the US

Organization and the BPP occurred long before the FBI

COINTELPRO became involved in the feud and that any proposals

-approved by the Bureau had relatively little effect on the

violence committed by either group. Mr. Seidel was alsoir

reminded that six of seven years ago the Congress of the

United States fully supported the wär in Vietnam in which

• thousands of people were killed but that under todays:

circumstances no support has been

i given. to South Vietnam.

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H: BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then posed a hypothetical question

involving the following factors:

Would Supervisor Bloeser

now or in the past approve a counter intelligence proposal

whereby one extremist with a criminal record of violence

be anonymously informed that another extremist with a

killed. Supervisor Bloeser replied that under the present

conditions such a proposal would not be approved, but

that he could not give an answer as to what his feelings

might have been six or seven years ago under any given

situation.

Mr. Seidel was again reminded that Congress

in the past has not hesitated to support wars which kill

thousands of people but that recently they have critized

the CIA for allegedly plotting to assassinate one individual

Mr. Seidel was also informed

that it was ironic that Congress was investigating another

agency of the Federal Government which was attempting to

prevent revolutionary violence in this country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired into the counter

intelligence proposals approved by the Bureau in relation

to the actress Jean Seberg and. Raymond Hewitt, a leader

of the BPP.

This proposal concerned the fact that seberg,

.. = Who was, then married to a French producer; admitted being

pregnant by Hewitt who was also married at the time...the ta.:

Bureau approved anonymously leaking this information to.jar co.

Hollywood columnist.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether

Supervisor Bloeser did or did not believe that this was. an

invasion of privacy. Supervisor Bloeser responded that the

item was news worthy and that it would have been any fair game

for: any newsmen had they come: across it in the course of their

'business which they could have probably easily done, and that

certainly Congress would not have critized a newspaper for

printing such an item or claim it to be an invasion of privacy.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to. the purpose of this particular

operation and he was informed that Miss Seberg was giving

support to the BPP and that it was hoped that such publicity

would. prevent any future.support.by.her.of the BPP

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He was further advised that it was the responsibility of the

FBI to determine who was funding revolutionary groups in this

country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired as to whether or not it

was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under

present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure.

He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an

effective intelligence operation under present circumstances

and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be

helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its

investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field.

Mr. Seidel

inquired as to whether it would be helpful to have specific

legislation which might completely separate criminal and

intelligence operations so one would not taint the other..

He was informed that if such legislation could be enacted

that it would undoubtedly help the FBI.

The interview lasted approximately two hours and

it was not necessary to consult with another Bureau

representative during this time.

August

7; 1975

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITIES (SSC) ; INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT

DIRECTOR IN CHARGE ROBERT E. GEBHARDT BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

SELOLUTION

• On August 7, 1975, 'Assistant Director Robert E.

Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los .

Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of

the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by

z a t he Fit i cata on be the Black Ran he Party

when Gebhardt was the Special Agent in Charge of the San

Francisco Division from 1970 to 1972:

The interview lasted fom 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,

and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any

Bureau representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau

representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas

of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters

of interview.

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt

was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther

Party investigation on a day to day basis being specifically

advised details of the investigation as it relates to the

Cointel Program.

It was explained to Seidel that as Special

Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein

over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had

many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

SEARCHED -

INDEED

POSTa: 32989813 - Page 119

## Page 120

therefore,

relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment

of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the

day to day direction of the various matters under investigation,

including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was

encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,

Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for

such consultation to resolve

any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC

when

the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and

the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually

terminated. Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage

was already in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival, however, he

oes recall receiving a phone call after th

"Keith Decision"

was handed

down instructing that all electronic coverage of

the BPP

and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.

The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the

discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the

intelligence type investigations should be completely removed

from the criminal investigations which investigations would be

looking. toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal

investigations looking

toward prosecutions, much intelligence

information is obtained from time to time which really has no

value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible

value with respect to the direction of the investigation.

some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence

information may be obtained and in other types, very little.

Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is

made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be

a basis for an investigation which procedures would include

matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

In some instances, in such security investigations

a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained

therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-

gence type investigations should not be removed from or

differentiated from criminal type investigations looking

toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an

outgrowth of the basic investigation.

- 2 -

NW 55235 DocId: 32989813 Page 120

## Page 121

Gebhardt was asked if he. felt the Cointelpro was a

separate entity distinguished trom the basic investigation

and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the

overall investigation in any particular organization or

individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact

Legislation which would set torth specitic investigative

• techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or

other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in

Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted,

and in reply to the question as to why such legislation should

not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative

agency, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexi-

bility

because no two investigations are exactly alike and the

circumstances of such*

related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should

assure the American public that questionable activity such

as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative

agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress

and the American people must rely upon the integrity and

honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the

FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,

hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees

and finally approved by the Senate.

It was further pointed

out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with

the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention

of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and

if circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could not

contemplated at this time, wherein it was thought such

activities should be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal

approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.

Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with

this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were

relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI

and Congress. He was informed that a Senate Oversight

Committee was recently established and it was felt. that this

was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

- 3 -

---

## Page 122

standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular

inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as

to our activities. He was informed that there should be

either a joint oversight committee between the House and

Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees

in both the House and Senate,

these committees should be the

entities through which all information relative to the

activities of the FBI should

flow.

It was emphasized 'however, that there

should be

regular consultation between, these representatives and the

FBI.

Inquiry was made as. to Gebhardt's opinion relative .

to the relationship between the Department of Justice and

the FBI and Seidel

was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's

pinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be

a free

flow of information between the

FBI and the Depártment

of Justice:

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed

up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely

set up

a structured oversight procedure of the activities

of the

FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many

of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure

itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will'

maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters

usually referred to as national defense, national security

or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations

must be based on the application of the facts toward a

particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique

that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal

se had in all instances th the Department of Justice should
