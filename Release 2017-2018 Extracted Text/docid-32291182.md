the Dominican Republic and was attempting to sell them stolen

Canadian bonds, for the receipt of which BROWDER had

previously been arrested.

Informant also advised at this

time that BROWDER told him he was working a deal with persons

in this country who are opposing CASTRO's regime in Cuba,

and to whom he hoped to sell 100 cases of dynamite at $100.00

per case:

On 9/1/64, informant told of his meeting with

MARK D.XAMSDELL and of information furnished by AMSDELL

concerning his association with BROWDER and of several trips

to south America, made by AMSDELL, for BROWDER, in connection

with the Tatter's gun running.

On 9/10/64, informant told of AMSDELL calling

him on 9/9/64 to relate that he was leaving at once for

• Caracas,

Venezuela, on a mission for BROWDER and "a big boy" (not

otherwise identified). He said AMSDELL told him he was to "see

about a boat' and take care of other business for these men.

Evaluation - Good.

RE: FOREIGN POLITICAL MATTERS - HAITI

IS - HAITI

Miami file 105-1597

On 9/23/64, informant advised that MARK D. AMSDELL

told him he returned from Haiti on the previous day, only to

be "grabbed" by U.S. Customs, where he was held and interviewed

for an hour and a half. AMSDELL told informant he carried a

letter of introduction to Haitian authorities from both EDWARD

BROWDER and a "Mr. SHINE", whom BROWDER introduced to AMSDELL

as his associate in the venture to furnish arms to Haiti:

Informant furnished detailed information as given him by AMSDELI

concerning the latter's trip to Haiti, including visits with

President FRANCOIS DUVALLIER and other top-ranking officials

concerning the proposed supplying of bombs, guns, airplanes and

airplane engines to Haiti. AMSDELL also told informant of two

airplanes coming to Miami, to be re-fueled, and then flown on

to Haiti for the use of the Government of that country, during

the next week.

(Pertinent information furnished by informant on

9/23/64,

was furnished U.S. Customs Agency Service, Miami, on

9/24/64.)

Evaluation - Very Good.

RE: SIDNEY STANLEY SHINE; ET AL

ITSA

Miami file 47-4780

On 1/4/65, informant advised that MARK D. AMSDELL

had visited his residence on 12/27/64, at which time he was

driving a new automobile with 1964 Florida license 1E20729.

Investigation revealed this automobile was rented on 12/26/64,

by the Hertz Corporation to one TIMOTHY DE JONG, Dallas,

Texas.

It was subsequently ascertained DE JONG

is a subject

in captioned case in the Dallas Office and additional subjects,

carried as unknown subjects but previously identified by

informant, are EDWARD BROWDER, LILLIAN BROWDER and MARK D.

AMSDELL.

Identity of these subjects in this case was effected!

solely by the informant obtaining the license number of the

automobile being driven by AMSDELL on 12/27/64.

Evaluation - Very Good.

M. AVAILABILITY

Informant has stated he is willing to travel to

other divisions, as needed, to assist the Bureau.

N. RELIABILITY

During contacts since July, 1964, informant has

appeared to be completely reliable and has not furnished any

false information.
