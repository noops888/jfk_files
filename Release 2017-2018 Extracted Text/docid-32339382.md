Intelligence Agency (CIA) and State Department

Memorandum 8/24/62 set forth results of interview of subject

by New York Office 8/16/62 during which he indicated he would assist

of any allegiance to U.9.

Interviewing Agents stated Gibson is a weasel-like character

evasive, opportunistic, with very little or no moral fiber at all

Since subject's dislike of FBI indicated he could never be

controlled as source or informant, and since it did not appear that

the risk involved would be worth our attempt to operate him, we instruct-

ed New York not to initiate any further contact with subfect but to

accept any data he might wish to furnish.

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

RE: RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON

105 - 93072

SECRET

A press release of the FPCC dated 9/24/62 indicated that

subject had left the U.S. for a visit to Algeria and was also expected

to visit several African countries. He apparently is visiting these

countries as a journalist. Y

On: 10/1//62 he sent letter to Agent of our New York Office

from Paris, France, in which he stated that "I can still-be of use to

you, even from here, if you think it worthwhile. The Committée could

shut down within a few days without any serious difficulties, expecially

now that Lee has learned he isn't going to get any money from our

friends in the Caribbean. Or as I said before, It could be preserved

and made harmless for use as a cover for an information-gathering

agency." Shee refers to Ted Lee, who is Security Index subject and

who is now acting as head of FPCC. In making mention of the "Committee"

Gibson is referring evidently to the FPCC. 4

OBSERVATIONS:

Data set forth in Gibson's letter and his present whereabouts

would be of interest to State and CIA. It is not felt that his letter

is of sufficient importance to notify the Attorney General; however, (4)

we should advise the Internal Security Division.

ACTION:

IF you approve, attached letter will be sent tagA, State

Department andInternal Security Division setting forth data in Gibson'

letter to our New York Office.

We are advising Legal Attache, Paris,

of subject's presence there.
