These assurances will preclude any meaningful CIA

notion on a phased basis to provoke a revolt Inside Cubs, sinue

unless there are major changes in operational and Internal con-

ditione in Cuba, such a revolt 1f provoked would be totally

destroyed by Cuban counteraction in s matter of hours or, at

port a toN dave unless supported by a majos basted states

M111tary connltment.' (In addition, the non-tavasion assurances

aB a practical matter will preclude invading Cuba on the preteit

of a contrived provocation such as an attack on Guantanamo.

C. CIA operations involving a high noise level and a

distinct element of attrlbutability, particularly paramilitary,

guerrinid, and commando type operations vill. be unacceptable

an a matter of policy.

.D. The Castro-communiet regime will remain in power for

, the indefinite future with its security and control apparatus

rolatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing

unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

conditions in Cuba Increasingly difficult. While It is

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in removing the offensive weapons from Cuba

serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there ls as yet no lairi

indication that the control of the Castro-communist regime over

Cuba bas been substantially weakenod.

3. The Valted States assurances of no InvaBlon and no

support of' an invasion will, in effect, constitute giving tr

Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will.
