Re New York airtel to the Bureau dated 10/21/66

On 10/28/66, BA 1328-PSI advised that he had no

knowledge of above captioned individual but that he had been

in contact with TOM BOWERS on that same date and that BOWERS

had advised him that "someone who really knew what it was

about"

might possibly be coming to Baltimore that weeken. all

that if the person did come, BOWERS would advise

the informant.

on 11/4/66, the informant stated that although he

had been in contact with BOWERS over the past weekend, BOWERS

had said nothing about the unknown subject coming to Baltimore,

Maryland.

For the information of the Bureau and New York,

TOM BOWERS, a student at Johns hopkins University (JHU)>

Baltimore,

Maryland, has recently formed the communist Organizing

Committee

(COC), a pro-Red Chinese organization, which is not

affiliated with any major subversive organization.

Contacts at the University of Maryland during the

past weekend failed to indicate that above captioned individual

came to the university during the weekend. It is presumed

that the subject did not come to Maryland during the past

weekend.

On 11/4/66 XBA 975-sfadvised that above captioned

individual might be identical with an American couple who were

1961 kand who were at _that time in

in that city. BA 975-8 tated that

the couple, whose names were DICK and SUSAN

of 110 Christopher Street, New York New York.

The couple appeared to be in their

ate 30's.
