ReNYtel, 10/22/74, captioned as above; MMairtal dated

"ACCION SINDICAL INDEPENDIENTE (ASI),*

NDEPENDENT LABOR ACTION; IS - CUBA, JUNTA CUBANA REVOLUCIONARI

JCR), CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY BOARD; IS - CUBA

ReNYtel reported that HORACIO MINGUILLON, head of

Comandos Libres Nacionalistas (CLN), is contemplating approaching

JOSE PEREZ-LINARES of the ASI to enlist his aid in obtaining

explosives.

This information appears to dovetail with information

set forth on page 1 of

the IHM attached to referenced MM airtel, a

copy. of which was designated for Newark.

Specifically, the

referenced MM communication reported that a leading figure in

the ASI had disclosed that a secret agreement had been negotiated

between the AsI and 3 other action groups in New York City to coor

dinate attacks in NYC in the future.

It would appear from the information in re NYtel

MINGUILION's group, the CIN, is one of the 3 action groups that

are party to the aforementioned secret agreement with the ASI.

The

other two groups are probably the Cuban Nationalist Movement and

Abdala.

Moreover, it is noted that the ASI and Abdala are head-

quartered on the

same floor in the same building in NYC.
