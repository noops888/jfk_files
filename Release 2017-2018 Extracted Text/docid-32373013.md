MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with David W. BELIN, 1 April 1975

O:

What was the line of reporting in StA during the period I serve

Is working level point-of-contact with the Warren Commission Staff:

A:

It was a multiple levele thing (a) from the Commission and AuD

personally via McCone so Dick Helms; b, from Helms to the two or

three components premartly concerned SE, then SB, Dave Murphy;

A, then WH; and ably In practice the substantive SB input worke

ip by one of it

research components headed by Lee Wigren--Mins

in ad for no an east eater vie cancel a o defector in

CI had own defector input.

Dick Helms and Murphy aiso dealt directly with the Conmission.

Did you hear:

?: [two crypts, one sounded by "Jackenet" ?1=

I had not.

Belin recalled that Castro had made a speech in which

he had charged assassination intent by emigres and had promised

retribution in kind if there was official support.

Q:

Had any thought been given to the assumption that an anti-Castro

assassination plot might have been underway, and fact it was known

to Helms and to Castro? [Mr. Belin said he now knew that Helms

was, in fact, aware of something underpay regarding Castro.

had no evidence to show that I ARGRN hädibeen

informed about it.]

Would that change any of the thinking re Oswald's Mexican trip and

contacts?

A:

Yes, I said, though I intended

to

GivE

potential importance

to Oswald's KGB contasts, anasrelatieu

Land atbers=-though

recognizing the wisdom gi the Warten Commission's handling=-had

felt there had been tokest the dowrat aspect that should have

been pursued:

Fact that his two Sowet consular contacts in Mexico City

had been identified as KGB and at least one (both?) had beer

traced organizattonatly to the Isth Hepartment (assassinations)

BEKIN

Q:

b.

Our defector information strongly insists that all

Western military defectore like Oswald--were screened by the

13th Department.

c. Thinness of file turned over by Soviets in view of b.

I acknowlledged_inretraspect

that tuban typothesis was worth recon-

sidering,

(ering; relations would appear the after 196-68, Venceremos, etc.).

Why did Oswald's lies include a denial to Dallas police that he had

. made the Mexican trip unless there was something important to hide

about it?

All his other lies concerned key factual elements of his

cover story.

Why also did. Marina deny she knew anything about the

Mexican trip in her first story to the FBI which she later rectified

before the Warren Commission? Nr. Belin noted that he had left the

hypothesis of Castro/Cuban involvement oper in his book.

He added

that it would have been important to have known the facts about the

inti-Castro plot at the me of the Warren Commission investigation

le felt the least he would have doneswould have been to have insister

on the

polygraphing of Marina spald regarding her knowledge of

Oswald's Mexican trip.

The proposed lines of actian

Indicated in paragraph 4.

2. AMMUG/1p the cuban Inteligence Service defectox,

has produced information of titerest to the President's

Commision on the sassmatoh of President Keanedy. GI

Staff learned of AMMUG/ oe'30 April. A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on 1 May (Attachment A). Mr. Swenson,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B)•

It was clear from Mr. Swenson's

summary that AMMUG/1 had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personael in Mexico City, albiet his kaowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWALD.

A follow-up questionnaire was submitted to

AMMUG/1 on 6 May (Attachment C). Mr. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the content of paragraph two.of Attachment D.

3. We have the problem of reconciling the operational

exploitation of AMMUG/1 and satisfying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mr. Rankin, AMMUG/1 is such az

operational gold mine that My. Swenson wants, at a maximum,

two months to work fully. It is palpable, however, that we

our association with the Coxmission, particularly with Mr. Rantin,

it seems possible for the Agency to work out an arrangement with

designee, preferably the former, discuss the AMMUG/1

situation on a very restricted basis with Mi. Rankin at his

earliest convenience either at the Agency or at the Commission

beadquarters. Until this takes place, it is not desirable to put

1. Reference is made to a telephone conversation yesterday

with Chief, CI Staff concerning this matter.

2. Because I am not aware of the information already

available to the Commission Investigating the Oswald Case or

furnished by the Agency, my debriefing of the source has been

based on the questions prepared by tha Cl Stat and on what the

Source answers have suggested. I shall be glad to pursue any

other topics suggested by CT Stail,

reference might bed interest.

a Luisa CALDERON, since she returned to Cuba,

has been paid a regular salary by the DGI even though she has

not performed any services.

Her home is in the Vedado section

where the rents are high.

b. Source has known CALDERON for several years.

Before going to Mexico, she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was known as the #Empresa

Transimport". Her title was Secretary General of the Communist

Youth in the department named in the previous sentence.

c. Luisa CALDERON

was transferred directly from her

position in the Ministry of Exterior Commerce to a post in México,

a matter of surprize to the Source.

d Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez (DGI pseudo MORCOS),

shortly before he left Cuba for Mexico on or about 16 April 1964,

Elind Memoranduma dated 05 May 1964~

C.

Conversations between Cl Staff and

C/WH/SA/CI

1. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specific questions prepared by Cl Staff were posed. The aúswers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A. That memorandum

which I dictated to a CI Staff stenographer appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program; of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2. On 07 and 08 May 1964 I furtber discussed the Oswald Case •

with the Source in order to clarify exactly what he knew and what

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe

that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached if I

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I have no personal knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD or his

activities and I do not know that OSWALD was an agent of the

Direccion General de Inteligencia (DGI) or any other directorate

or department of the Cuban Government.

I first heard of OSWALD aiter the assassination of President

Kennedy when news media carried the name of OSWALD.

Personnel in the Del first commented about the case, so far as

I can recall, one day alter lunch when a group of officers, of

whom I was one, were chatting.

The officers present were about

ten including Roberto SANTIESTEBAN, Norberto HERNANDEZ

Manuel VEGA Perez.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously had

been assigned to Mexico in thé Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence ofticer of the DGI. VEGA

mentioned that OSWALD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

two or three times in connection with a visa application

during the time that VEGA, w as in Mexico. I gatherea,

although I do not know thät VEGA made any specific

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could bave reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the DGI,

Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba. This is because DGI

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the DGI:

Such agents on appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrasefto indicate their relationship

with the DGi. (I do not know the particular phrase used

in every case. I do knownthat agents from El Salvador in

requesting visas alwayer made mention of the name "Mauricio" )

The DGI officers ata Cocsulate interview visa applicants to

find out if they arcagents. If the fisa applicant does not use

one of the indicated phrases, the DGl odicers, instead ai

granting the vish immediately, tell the applicant to return in

a few days.

The officer then notifies Habana and requests

authority for the visa. "I cannot recall If VEGA even made the

statement that he bad requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez also would have

seEn OSWALD because he worked wth VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

I thought that Luisa CARDBRON wight have had contact with

OSWALD because I learned about. If March 1964, shortly before

I made a trip to Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico. The imoration to which I refer was told

officer narded Norberto HERNANDEZ de

other items during my trip to viexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was receiving a salaty from

the DGI although ste apparently did not do any work

for the Service, CERNANDEZ told me that bers was

a peculiar case and that he himself believed that she

bad been recruited in Mendco by the Central intelligence

Agency althouga Manuel PINDIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree.

As recall, HERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DEI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or something similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difticult la Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard" or something different.

As I understood the matter, the letten from the American

was a love letter but-fidicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationshig between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON: a sounderstood from HeRNANDEz thai

after the interception akthe fetter she had been followed

and seen in the compammat an American.. I do not know i

this could have been OSWALD. I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mezico when she worked in the Ministry

of Exterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth. She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked me in connection

with this, whom I recall, Is Sylyia DURAN and I know very

little about her.

What happened was that I was in the Cuban

imbassy in Mexico on 23 March, 9o about 1230 in the alternoo

reparing to return to Habana the same da

I was talking to

some other Cubans including Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez and

fou BUENAVENTURA af the Cuban Embassy, a courier named

"Enio", a courter named "Tator and one other Cuban whom I

I recall that, after the news of the assassination of

President Kennedy reached the DGf orders were issued

for all offias of the DCI, at Headquarters and in the field,

to sort and package alf documents according to whether

they were "muy sebreto! (rety, secret), "secreto" (secret),

or "importante" (important.

The material once packaged,

was to be held pending turther instructions. All travel by

DG officers and all DGi pouches were suspended temporarily.

In addition, I recall that DCI Headquarters personnel were

Instructed either to remain in the DGI Headquarters offices

or to keep the DGl aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for

these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the Dal offices,

AS

nearly as I can recall, we were able to unpackage DGI fles

and use them normally about the Irdöf December 1983."

3. In briet,

the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assasaination of President Kennedy or

about the activittes of OSWALD, Tethe paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to fee further clarification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most famillar with the details al the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source This can be arranged at any time. Mean-

Subject - General: Debrieling of Cuban Source

Specific:

The source does not have didect knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD

or his activities but was able to provide items of interest based on

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia.

The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

1. Prior to October 1963, OSWALa Visited the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City on two or three occasions. Before, during and after

these visits, OSWALD was in contact with the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogelo RODRIGUEZ Dopez.

a euban intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current Cuban 1S cheng Mexico. He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prigr to which he held the same post as

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cuban IS staff officer in Mexico. He has

three Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

Antonio.

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 1964..

2.

The source does not know whether or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity of other manner.

3. A.

When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

reached the DGI, it caused much comment concerning the fact

OSWALD had been in the Cuban Embagsy in Mexico.

In addition,

orders were issued for all headquarters and field officers of the

DGI to sort and package all documents according to whether they

were "Muy secreto" (very secret), 'secreto" (secret), and

"importante" (important). The material once packaged was to be

held pending further instructions:

In addition, all travel by DGI

officers and all DGI poucheswere suspended temporarily.

B. When the news that OSWALD was the assassin reached

•the DGI, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to request a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September 1963 was relayed to any

Cuban service.

5. It is not known if the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina who is recalled in "The Hook", the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

in the United Nations in New York, SANTIEST ABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significance.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli-

gence services is not known.

8. Nothing is known about Soviet proposals following the news of.

President Kennedy's assassination.

The only fabrication known is the special matter by Fidel

CASTRO previously mentioned.

10. Nothing is known about Jack RUBENSTEIN aka Jack RUBY.

1l. The name Gilberto LOPEZ is not familiar but, if he visited

DGI headquarters, a photograph of him possibly could be identified.

Dear Mr. Kno

che:

As yOu

know, there have been allegations that the CIA was

involved in

a plan

to assassinate

Fidel Castro. For the

purposes of this letter, we will assume that these allegations

are correct, and based upon this assumption I would like to

know the answers to the following questions:

1. Did anyone with the CIA tell any menber of the Warren

Commission or any lawyer serving on the Warren: Commission

staff that such plans had been underway? If the answer is

yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the

Agency delivered said information, to whom it was delivered,

when it was delivered, what specifically was told or said,

what documents there are to support the answers to the fore

going questions, and what response, if any was received from

the Warren Cormission. If the Connission was not told about

this, why was it not told and who made the decision not to

deliver such information to the warren Connission?

2.

There is evidence that Castro, prior to November 22,

1963,

knew about the existence of such plans and the possible

in-

Government. Did the CIA: at any time prior

to the completion of the warren Commission Investigation have

any docurents' or other information indicating that Castro may

have known about nich plans?

If the answer is yes, would you

please fushishug with copies of all such documents and details

of any such information.

Would you

any awareness of pgssible assassination plots on the lives of

Cuban leaders.

ing a possible assassination.of any American leader..

If SO.

would you please advise us of all details and also advise us

who: in the United States Government outside the CIA was ad-

5.. Prior to his death Lyndon Johnson supposedly stated that

he believed that although there was no doubt. that Oswald

killed Kennedy and Tippitt, nevertheless Oswald night have

been a part of a conspiracy in retaliation to possible United

States assasgination attempts in Cuba.

Would you please advise

us of any information in Agency files showing whether or not

MEMORANDUM FOR: MAN Rocca

with

° I. Test Mars Reporting

Agaucy's Perition

Commission

The DOP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the

Directos has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday.

MI.. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

Dealing

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues of

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the. Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WH source.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3.

Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

This briet is concerted yith live topics which, it is

anticipated, will ario i to course grine Director's appear -

ance before the Preendent's Commegion. These are:

a. Formal and)

inqualified negation by the DCI

of any contact or association, direct or indirect,

between the Central Intelligence Agency and Lee

Harvey Oswald. This should be accompanied by

the tabling of an affidavit signed by the Director

and notarized. (TAB A)

b. A formal assurance by the Direster that all

information in the possession of the Agency regarding

Oswald's activitice and atticiations outside of the

United States has been made available to the

Commission through its staff, with which there has

been close and frequent contacts since the inception

of the Commission's activities. (TAB B)

activity.

It is suggested

at the DCI take the position

that at this time there is no conclusive evidence of

conspiratorial aponsorship af Oswald; that all Agency

information bearing our this problem has been furnished

to the Commission for evaluation and consideration in the

framework of its total knowledge of the facts. The Agency,

at the present time, is lacking any krowledge of recent

information or documentation furnished by the Soviet

Government to the Commission with respect to Oswald's

activity in the Soviet Union.. (TAB C)

d. The DCI's suggestions for improving policy and

organization with respect to the personal security of

the President. Certain steps relating strictly to the

Agency's jurisdiction have already been suggested by

memorandum. It is proposed that the Director now

make specific suggestions involving legislation which

would treat information bearing on the personal security

of the President and, advisedly, other Federal officials

directly related to national security affairs in a manner

similar to what currently exists by statute for special

instances, knowledge with respect to acquisition has

been made available on a highly restricted basis to

Mr. Rankin and to certain elements of his staff. It is

recommended that the DCI not respond on the record,

to queries on these topics. He-should suggest that all

such "technical questions" be worked out in detail through the

channels and procedures that have functioned very well

-- we believe -- between the Commission and particular

CIA components. (TAB E)

method nor a surprise as an occurrence.

Suggestions for Improving Policy and Or

Presidential Securit

anization Regarding

Mr. Rankin raised this question dire ctly by letter. In

its response, the Agency confined itself to elements relating

to its statutory mission. Specifically, it was suggested that:

a. The Secret Service, or Treasufy, record

with the Ottice of Central Reterence a formal requiren

sent for information elating to Presidental security.

ba. It was sougented that, ir the secret Service

inteaded to expand its prettigence coverage of possible

threats to the President's security, our experience.

showed that it would need a specialized organizational

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

itself.

c. The CIA reply also noted that the Agency was.

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing.

On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

In his presentation to the Commission after referring

to these earlier suggestions

the DCI should state that he desires

ggestion which he has not

tabled heretofore.

The Commission's major problem has been the assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance. Because conspiracy is the

core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in

advance information relating-to Presidential security and the

FOU-

problem faced by the countty a few years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL. 165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab -

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any persos, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons -- for exarople, asylum if they were.

Finally, a-Reward Board was

ereated to admineter the purposes of the Act.

1) The DCt should auste that the Commission consider a

recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of secretiassociations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage. It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

The suggestion does not restion the material elements of

reward and special treatment.

The DCI can assure the Com-

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions have repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases, acted upon their repugnance for

There are specifio cases in the past tea years which document

this assertion Trusted enfganel charged with assassination

missions have abandoned the mission even without the assurance

In making this suggestion, he DCI may go one step further

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

examine the advisability of legislation making it a Federal offense

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive. 3) The DCI could also

indicate that the Commission might desire to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

spiracy to kill any Federal Official in the President's personal

circle of official associates directly concerned with national

security affairs.. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

Commission by CLA on die brosking level regarding Oswald'o

activity in Mexico City in September and October 1963. The

Commission Staff has been in detailed communication and

convergation with the Agency working levels both in head-

quarters and in Mexico City. Within the past week,

significant information has been developed by CIA regarding

the relationship with Oswald of certain Cuban intelligence

personnel in Mexico City and the reaction in Havana within

the Cuban Intelligence Service to the news of the assassination

of President Kemedy. The Commission Staff is in the course

of being briefed on the Cuban aspect.

It is suggested that the DCI handle any question on the

Mexican and Cuban phases of Oswald's activity as "technical

questions" which members of the Commisston can develop

from or through their own staff with-the app

of the Agency. This wou

overall assurance that he bad ingructed his personzel to place

Review of Selected Items in the

John F. KENNEDY Assassination

REFERENCE: Letter by David. #. Belin to

Henry Knoche,

15 April 1975,

paragraph 3

(Regarding Public Statement

by CASTRO,

attached

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Pidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception 1n

Havana; even nore unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press' correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the jecord in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinasal

ovocative fasbion

(" ... KENNEDY is a cretin.

the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of Séptember 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning papere the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-colunn head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

*Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba.'

"Bitterly denoancing what he called

tory, Castro said, weare prepared to

fight them andanster in kind. U.S. leaders

ist plans

•. World affairs ... seemed to be

entering

a more peaceful climate a few days

ago, but now this trend has changed with

attacks.

""The U.S. is always ready to negotiate

and make promises which later it will not honor.

This has happened to promises made during the

October crisis. They have been broken as can

be seen with new attacks.

"'But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'"

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance.

The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 september, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper (9 september 196y, page B-4) and reworded the content

of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

Litical ashe

- in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7.. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY

assassination, that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headguarters attention te the Ap stary very shortly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the

contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's

request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question mark.

Il. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban

relations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at

18. At TIMexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Tuisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

news. "Juisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of dourse I knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three (she laughs], what barbarians! ..."

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination.

The tenuous, enfeymatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

LuiSa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Direatorate Canéral of Intelligence (DGI).

-She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

tọ be working in DGI Headguarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S succesSOr)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

c. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSwAlD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's

activity in

Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the

Mexican Governmental authorities. A direct

sources as engaged in the active development

OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October

1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

for Havana. It was reliably reported about

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

or illegally, had to pass through him first. He

took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba

for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days.5

For example, VEGA would have handled the details of the

a Lame duck like AzcuE whose slot had been taken by the

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

there remains the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraph on which ALVARADO showed evidences of

The ALVAraDa story is a particularly acute repre-

sentation of the quiriculties that beset the evaluation of

obsorved enemiroo: certain elements of the story persiat

despite the impeachment of its major premises: ALVARAg,

whose account did not become public until the release of

the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a negro

with red-dyed hair.

Elena CARRO de Paz is a necurial, articulate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN. the husbard of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two wonen descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communism.

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans andsin particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that 'they were just passing

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

of the three Gringos "without a doubt' at the

and not for a draft letter.

Mr. lurphy suggested that we ask

only for certain records rather than put spacizic questious

to the sovlets.

Murphy suggested that thesa nigkt include

Soviet tospital records connected with lee Oswald's attemptod

suicide, city visa and registration records for Moscoy and

Stinsk,

factory personnel records Iron Oswald's place of enplay-

ment,

thinking about thesa proposals.

(Note: I instructed Nr. Figren to prepare a

drait of suggested queries, using the

assistance oi DERYABIN and to have this

ready;

i1 possible, by the closa of

business today.)

: 3.

Rantin stated that the Commission vants to account

uinute by minute and hour by hour, for Oswald's

tire ortside the United States. Ir. Bagley suggested that.

the narrative chronology of Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union

be, convasted to a chronology tabulation which would permit us

more staply to insert added details and dates as we learned

of thenjia

other documentation which we can expect to roceive

shortly.

This vas agread.

(Note:

I instructed ir. Tigren to begin ro-

casting the narrative imediately into

this {ora.)

Bir. Rankin sald that the Comission has a waist-high

stack of documents and reports received fron the FBI and Secret

Service which ClA has not yet recelved.

These Include Secret

Service interviews with Narina Oswald,

letters fron-Les Oswald

in the USSB and other naterial. Le promised to send this

material to Mr. Helms shortly.

(Boto:

He will pass appropsiate parts of this

material to DEBYABIN for further analy-

sis along the lines of his earlier work

on documents already in our possession.)

5. -

Messrs. Anglater. luphy and Bocca considered REBYA-

BIN's/ toitLa1

analysts of Marina Oswald's documents, and the

questions to which it gave rise,

to be a forthvatta and

import fit contrabution.

CIA would be unable to make any seri-

O1s

analysisfor even hypothesis until some of DubYABIN's

cuestions kad been answered.

Mr. Rocca suggested that DERKA-

EIN's paper be recast into nore of a questionnaire form and.

Ar. Bagley agreed, pointing out that duilashi's coment and

speculation could

be put off to the side as explanatory coi

ment on ench question,

Mr. Anglaton and Mr.

Murphy thought that it would be desirable to send this paper

to the Harren Commission in advance of other CIA reports with

a nenorandim informing the Connission that we would need

answers to this interin questionnaire in order to reconstruct

a detatled chronology of Oswald's tine in the USSR and to

corment on his activity there.

The. Coumission would be asked

to proCure

the information from Varina through any Agency it

might choose.

Note:

I instructed Mr. Wigren to prepare the

DERYABIN paper in this format urgently.)

G. Hr. Angleton reported that he had asked the Cormis-

sion representatives certain questions portaitag to our use

of defectors in analysing the Oswald papers:

Has the Comnission formally requesting us to

defectors analyse the material?

w. Wellins thought that the answer

Moto this question is yes.

However,

Mr. Angleton asked for a formal

request from the Commission to this

effect.

The FBI. has stated that 1t3

reports are not to ba passed to

ALLADLE, which may cause sone compli

cationg.

b.

Nould the Comission be prepared to assume the

burden of responsibility if such & defector should disa-

gree with

the Comnission's opinions of comeup with a

radically different hypothesis or indaucetation?

The persons present sald that the

Commission would.

c..

If a defector who had contrlbuted to the analy-

sis of the documents should be unwilling to appear person-

ally and formally before tha Cormission, would the

Commission exercise its subpoena powers against hin?

Ar. Rankin thought that 1f there was

a risk involved for the defector, the

Commission would not do so.

However,

Ransin promised to get a lornal answer

from the Cormission on this point.

The answer was that in prisciple oux
