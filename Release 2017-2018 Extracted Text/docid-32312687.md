ADMINISTRATIVE:

This report has been classifed CONFIDENTIAL

since data reported from T-l, T-2, T-3 and

T-5 could reasonably result in identification of confidential"

informants of continuing value and compromise the effectiveness

thereof.

Inasmuch as the Denver Chapter, FPCC, is relatively inactive,

the Denver Division will continue to submit reports on a six-

month basis.

Agents who observed VINCENT TED LEE on 4/18/63 were SA's JOSEPH
