Cecilia says It is absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD was). Julieta says

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with the

It was perfectly planned, indeed some of the

Leave Mexi for Habana.

However, Echeverria later told LEGAl that he had decided to rearrest

Silvia to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and-later be unavailable as a

Since we had received no reply to yesterday's @elegrem (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above)

we have not requested Mexi gov to take a any action against Silvia except to maintain

Increased surveillance of her activities.

Echeverria dater denied to LEGAT that he had any

specific concrete evidence that she was about to leave for Cuba.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It is quite possible, and even probable, that contra-

dictory statements made by Echeverria are explaineg by desire of GOM to play down Importance

of OSWALD visit here.

Mexi line st111 1s that OSWArD, visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT, that DORTICOS only interested in finding

out whether Mexi authorlties tried to pay a stôry from Silvia.

This is obviously incorrect

remarkable coincidence that both DORTICOS and ALVARADO tank about money paid to OSWALD.

For one thing, pay for an assassin 1s a factor which mediately rises in the mind of

Secondly, DORTICOS may hayesheard through some Russian or Cuben

this business and he really wants to talk a few minutes with the Amb and find out

"this type - what were his desires here" for as you know the Embassy here (which Embassy)

feels that all is not correct.

LEONOV says he will tell the Amb's Secretary wher

the Emb can discuss this case and have the information endeded for the 1hterview

numberas available and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination

of the Individual requesting the reservations. That reservation is respected under normal

conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event all seats are not

filled, It may be held until the actual departure of the bus.

Prior to the departure of

the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that

particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communioates by radio to the company

headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers

on the bus in relation to the

Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tickets.

/ Francisco ALVARADO,

ticket salesman and dispatcher for Transportes Frontera, advised

that he prepared most of

the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name

and destination "Lared"

appear opposite Seat No. 4.

He stated that he did not write the "OSWLD" reservation info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and

sinfo recorded by the

baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ.

ALVARADO is quite certein at th

esent time that the

Individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchases

whacket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest. No ticket number was

reporded for that person, and

a search of the company's records in Monterrey had failed to eate a ticket stub which

was not otherwise accounted for in connection with that part cular trip. I. The notations

by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, T Monterrey" reflected that he had reported by radio to the

Monterry office of the company that the bus had departed with nine

"paying" passengers

and was either of Naugahyde or canvas material.

He did not remember that OSWALD had ever

worn a coat and belleved he usually appeared in a short-sleeved shirt of a knit variety.

Matilde GARNICA, maid at the hotel del Comercio, recognized photo of OSWALD as being the

young American who had occupied room No. 18 for almost a week during the latter part of

last year.

She arrives at work between 0900 and 1000 and leaves at 2100.

Clearly recalls

OSWALD, as few Americans stay at the hotel.

He had few personal

effects, carried in a

"small, brown, zippered handbag" canvas or Imitation leather material.

She had seen OSWALD COPY

checked to determine which rooms were available for cleaning.

When she saw him in the room

on Saturday he said "good morning" in English, and a short time later left the hotel.

OSWALD and remembers that on the date of the latter's departure from|the hotel and on the

basis of sign language and the word "taxi" which he understood

that OSWALD wanted a taxicab,

RODRIGUEZ walked around the corner from the hotel where he obtained a taxicab. He believed

OSWALD left the hotel between 0630 and 0700 since it was getting light when he went in

search of the taxicab.

He could not be more precise concerning the time. He believed

OSWALD gave him a small tip of one or two pesos. «OSWALD carried his own

luggage downstairs

and walted in front of the hotel with the luggagesuntll RODRIGUEZ returned with the taxicab.

RODRIGUEZ commented that while he had little difficulty obtaining a taxi at the early hour,

It becomes very difficult to secure taxi tranportation between 0730 and 0830 because of the

heavy traffic at that time.

RODRIGUEZ related that OSWALD always arrived at the hotel late

at night, "midnight or thereafter", but he never noticed any indication that OSWALD had been

drinking.

/ Guillermo GARCIA Luna said of Pedro RODRIGUEZ Ledesma that RODRIGUEZ 15

"humble but very serious, deeply religiou

Ate soup of day, rice, and either meat or eggs, but rejected dessert and coffee, and was very

money (cost) conscious.

Meals cost five to six pesos.

Individuals in neighborhood of

///// Guillermo GARCIA Luna advised that on the

basis of a search of abandoned correspondence, review of his records and accounts, and refreshing

his memory through discussions with other personnel at hotel, he had been able to develop

the following data: Antonio OLIVA is a Negro who had been considered Cuban but had clarified

MENO TO FBI from WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll info he

allegedly recelved fron a well known Cuben solentist and acquaintance on 23 Noy 63, but which

The release of the Warren Comm Report reminded him of the inci-

eus toms procedures.

His

curiosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircratt

hed just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, via Tijuana and Mexi City. The plane had been fofoed to land at Tijuana due

to engine trouble. By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved in assassination.

de speculated that OsWAld had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

OSWALD at a pary fiena said CarlOs SOLORZANO 1s well acquemted with Cub Amb HERNANDEZ

was in Mexico prior to

Armas, and that he was not leftist but his brother, Alfonso, was a Communist. Amb HERANDEZ

told SOLORRANO he wanted to meet Elena, so SOLORZANO

ranged a party at his own home on

30 June 66 and invited both of them.

Emanued CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin, DEA?

• Canedo, head of publishing firm

ease, since he is a friend of hers and was tha billy anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening, Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she des

ge bed as intelligent and cultured, concen-

trated his attention on her..... and expregied interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He issued & personal Invitation to her te

tend the annual literary festival of the Casa

*not a Fidelista and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present..

../ Later, her friend,

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned her not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On 4 July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home

on Calle Alencastre in

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Americas In Havans.

The first letter, written last October (66?) gave her address

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written. In April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

Ibe envelope for the first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

sender, which was the Cub Emb here.

The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments. / Elena stated

the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was because she spent several

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel is

Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address, ! Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensibly to

protect her fron the Sonminicis, this raised the question of how the Cubend obtained that,
