R. Comstock, L. Ivon, C. Jonau, C. Neidermier and F. Williams,

met Assistant District Attorney, Frank Klein, in the office

of the District Attorney. At that time Mr. Klein began an

involved in the assasination of President John F. Kennedy.

which had occurred in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963 by

the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. Information had been brought

With this information at about shortly after midnight

these officers went to 3330 Louisiana Avènue Parkway, knocked

on the door and same was opened by a subject who identified

himself as Alvin Beaubouef. The officers requested the present

whereabouts of David Ferrie and Beaubouef said he did not know.

It was obvious that he was trying to conceal the facts. He was

placed

under arrest and the officers went up to the second

story apartment where they found Layton Martens seated in a

chair. This subject was questioned and he stated that he was

presently living with Ferrie. However, he did not know the

present whereabouts of Ferrie. Martens too was placed under

arrest and the

officers instituted a search.

In this residence

was found a smith & wesson 38 cal. 5 inch barrell 6 shot

• revolver, butt No.

Army type rifle, Serial No. 7/47AB5633; a bayonet having a

holster; a flare gun; and a large quantity of ammunition.

Martens denied the ownership of these items stating they be-

longed to Ferrie.

Martens and Beaubouef were conveyed to the district

police station and a continuous stakeout was placed on 3330

Louisiana Avenue Parkway. Numerous locations in the city were

checked in an

attempt to locate Ferrie. All were negative.

At about 4:30 P.M. on this date of 11/25/63, David Ferrie

appeared in the office of the District Attorney with his

attorney, Mr. G. Wray Gill. At this time he was questioned by

Mr. Klein and Officer Comstock.. He was allowed to see a photo-

graph of Lee Harvey Oswald and he denied ever seeing this man

before.

He related a story of having left New Orleans at

about

9:00 P.M., Friday, November 22, 1963, going to Houston, Texas

Ferrie was placed under arrest after his interview

and booked in the First District Police Station as stated above.

col. Garrison of the Department f Public Safety,

Texas Rangers, was contacted by telephone by Mr: Klein and the

details surrounding the arrest of Ferrie were given to him.

His office conducted a

preliminary investigation; however, they

were unable to implicate this subject in the assasination of

President Kennedy: On 11/26/63 Captain Priest of the Houston

Police Department Detective Bureau was contacted by telephone

and asked to verify the movements which Ferrie described

relative to him being in the State of Texas. After several

hours Captain Priest notified this office the results of his

investigation which corroborated the story related by Ferrie

in that Ferrie arrived in Houston on 11/23/63 and made a visit

to a skating rink owned by an individual named Roland. Captain

Priest was also able to corroborate Ferrie's story as to him

being in Galveston, Texas the following day.

The officers have been unable to uncover any

evidence which would link Ferrie to the assasination of Pre-

sident Kennedy.

All of the above described items seized from the home

of Ferrie were returned to him after they had been photographed

and serial numbers taken wherever possible:

Investigating the 1966 address of SERGIO ARCACHA,

10746 Lake Gardens. the following was ascertained:

His telephone number was DA-8-5966. This is a four-

apartment building in the lochwood Apartment Complex located

near white Rock Lake. This particular building

which oas

occupied by ARCACHA has four apartments, A.B.C, and D. ARCACHA

occupied Apartment D which is'one of the upstairs apartments.

This particular building in tro-stosy the lower half has buff

brick, the upper with gray siding. There is one main entrance

servicing all four apartments. Apartmit D rants for $78.00 per

month, has two bedrooms, livingroom, ning room, fitchen. bath,

no central air or heat and le unfunished. water is free, other

Ltisities are paid by the tenant. The same apartment furnished

with all utilities paid, including central air and heat, would

rent for $150.00u This particuler building is six years old.

Apartment A is occupied by MRS. ERCELLE BRIDGES. Apartment B 1s

occupied by R. F. CRAWFORD, Apartment C is occupied by ROBERT To

Young, and Apartment D was found to be vacant on my personal

visit. According to the new apartment manager, CRAWPORD and

ARCACHA were listed as being delinquent in their rent. however.

with some reluctance and inquiries, MRS. CRAMPOND (BI and MRS.

YOUNG (C) advised that ARCACIA had moved to 9915 Denegal Drive.

MRS. YOUNG and MRS. CRAWFORD and one of her children (unknowingly

to her) identified the photorraph of ARCACHA. ApparentlY ARCALIA

had not been gone from here very long and still owed some rent.

We proceeded to 9915 Danegal Drive which is

approximately two minutes ay. This i8 asalagle, one-story

dwelling of brick constructin in a middle-class neighborhood.

There was no activity at thill particulde addrest. Parked in the

drive, facing the street, was a blue Pontiac Tempest. License No.

Texas (1966) KxZ 314. Seconda aftar our arrival, ARCACHA drove

up in a beige Ford Thunderbird. This vehicle bore licence, Texas

(1966) KX 108. The driver, ARCACHA, passed our vehicle very

slowly staring at us intently as he passed continuing to do so

until parked in the drive and inside the house. In comparison

to AFCACHA'S photograph, it was noticed that he had a consider-

able amount of gray hair but was still predominently dark. He

was dressed casually wearinga loose fitting dark sweater and

open shirt collar.

I then immediately gentaMR. GARRISON in New Orleans

advising him of the present location of ARCACHA. He advised not

to interrogate him but to continue on with other phases of my

missioniin dallas. A specially developed code was used between

GARRISON and GURVICH during this call.

En route to White Rock Atiport, I passed 2274 Spring

Hill Drive and found that this was a single. one-story dwelling

in a middle class neighborhord. Its proximity to the white Rock

Airport is as close as one could get. I interviewed a woman

living there, and she advised she had moved there in June. 1965.

She: further stated she had met ARCACHA in Dallas shortly before

June, 1965. lat a time when her family was looking for a place to

live and ARCACHA advised her that this residence would soon be

available as he planned to move. This woman stated that they were

renting this home and that AFCACHA had done the same. She also

polland!

See lamen Comnission volume 24, Do 458 CE 2038a "Barnes said Bob Mulhaland

of NBC news Chicago, talked in Dallas

to one Fairy, a narcotics addict now out

on bail on a sodomy charge in Dallas. Fairy said that Oswald had been under

hypnosis from a nan doing a mind-rading act at Ruby's "carousel". Fairy

said to be a private detective and the owner of an airplane who took

young boys on flights "just for kicks". "

The above Barnes'is Gene Barnes of NBC, a west cofast camera man. Bob Mulholland

is now producer of the Huntley-Brinkley show in Washington.

I spoke with Mulholland as well as Dick Valeriani and Dick Fisher all of whom

were in Dallas for NBC during the weekend of Nov 22-26. 1963. Mulholla d

was directing the NBC coverage of the

assassination.

Mulholland said he remembered something about a guy with an air plane, that the

name Fairy or Ferrie was familiar and that he had a vague memory of someone:

slying guns to Cuba and queers. Mulholland however did not speak to anyone

Airs did not recessic

He pictura di fezitic.

In Dallas as he was busy with the NBC crew. He recalled that he probably heard

the above from John Coporan of NBC news New Orleans. Mulholland said that

Coporan called and told him about Ferrie and shortly thereafter the FBI visited

Mulholland. He remembers the story because of the FBI visit because that is

when he discovered his phone was tapped. Valeriani and Fisher remember the incident.

I called John Coporan who is now with WNEW-TV news in New York. He remembers the

story very well. "we got an anonymous tip and one from a former assit. D.A. about

this man who had an airplane and that this man was due in Texas on Nov. 22.. This

man, Ferrie, had known Oswald in the Civil Air Patrol. He was probably a homosexual.

There was something about a rendevous having been arranged to fly Oswald out of

the country." Coporan says he then called Garrison to find out about the tip.

HH. 54756

"I didn't have too much success". He then called Mulholland in Dallas:

Soon after that call he too recieved a visit from the FBI. Garrison

then arrested Ferrie.

On Monday Ferrie called Coporan and said he had seen him giving editorials on

TV and he wanted to talk.. Coporan went over to the jail, he remembers Ferrie

had a migrain headache. He also remembers

"he was an odd duck". They talked for

one half hour and Ferrie convinced Coporan that

"someone had very cleverly linked Ferrie

to Oswald knowing it Iboked believably. "Ferrie was very upset. "

When Coporan left the cell the Secret Service want in. After them, the BBI talked

with Ferrie, and

after them Garrison's men want in. Coporan was the first

to talk with Ferrie.

"Ferrie was working as a private investigator for a prominent New Orleans

lawyer, G. Wray Gill. I think Gill got him released and then fired him.

Perrie Called me a couple of times after that protesting his innocence.

The

story continued to intrigue me, so we tried to follow it up. But then we deciled

there was nothing to persue and gave up."

"Personally I tink farrison arrested Ferrie in order to make himself famous, but

maybe the FBI asked Garrison to make the arrest because they didn't want to be

involved if the accusation turned out to be false, which it did."

Coporan was in a hurry and he was also rather curious why I was so interested in

Ferrie. I didn't want to persue it too far in case he might mention my call

to any of his friends in N.O.

Too bad, but it looks likel the time

the story got to Barnes it had been added to

mind reading stories etc. And the FBI knowing all about Ferrie anyway: just

discounted it. As far as I can find, Ferrie's name is not mentioned any where

else in the Warren Commission books or the National Archives index of material

received from the commission and/or the BI/secret service.

1525 AZTEC ST., APT. "C"

Sgt. Tom Duffy and Ptn. Cliency Navarre report of

interviewing one THOMAS COMPTON residing 1525 Aztec Street,

Apartment "C"., on March 9, 1967 at 10:30 A.M., in the Office of

the District Attorney, 2700 Tulane Avenue.

Mr. COMPTON stated that he was a member of the Moisant

Wing of the Civil Air Patrol from 1954 until January of 1958. He

was acquainted with DAVE FERRIE on and off for approximately ten'

(10) years.

On one occasion he visited FERRIE at a residence on

Vinet Street and another single visit in Airline Park.

MI. COMPTON stated that in the Spring of 1964 he

stopped for gas in a service station on the Veterans Highway and

again met DAVE FERRIE. ME. COMPTON related that, after learning

DAVE FERRIE and AL LANDRY owned this station, he obtained a part-

time job as an attendant.

After working a short period and unable

to collect his pay, and not being relieved on duty by LANDRY, he

decided to quit.

While employed at this service station, he

helped DAVE FERRIE tow his airplane over to the station.:

The

aircraft was in terrible condition, more so from

vandals than

deterioration or wear and tear.

Mr. COMPTON stated that the last

time

he knew of DAVE FERRIE's plane flying was 1957

and rumors of

same up to 1961.

Mr. COMPTON further stated that some time before the

assassination of President Kennedy, he drove DAVE FERRIE to Camp

Street across from the Lafayette Square to GUY BANISTER's office.

GUY BANISTER and DAVE FERRIE then went to a coffee shop on the

corner and talked over a baverage.. Mr. COMPTON related that he

sat at another. table in this establishment and did not hear any.

of the conversation.

Also, he could not remember how long before

the assissination this took place.

MK. COMPION continued to state that on Sunday, after

the assassination, at 5:30 A.M. he was awakened by DAVE FERRIE in

his dormitory bed at the University of Southeastern in Hamnona,

Louisiana.

Mr. COMPTON stated that until this day he is uncertain

how DAVE FERRIE located him on this date. At this time, DAVE

TERRIE was in hysterics and near tears as he stated "The police

are at my home and have taken some of my things". COMPION stated

that DAVE FERRIE. did not elaborate on "my things", and stated

that FERRIE also related that he didn't do anything wrong.

The

two talked for a while on different unrelated subjects and then

FERRIE made-two-calls to New.Orleans,and-COMPTON believed they

were to G. W. GILL, Attorney at Law..

COMPTON stated that DAVE

FERRIE left at approximately 3:30 A.M. the same morning and it

is believed that he returned to New Orleans in a Ford Falcon

Station Wagon painted light blue.

COMPION stated that DAVE FERRIE

did not tell him ha had been to Texas.

COMPTON stated that he had never met LEE HARVEY OSWALD,

and also that he could not connect him in any way with the C.A.P.

The only knowledge of OSWALD was from Mr. BILL WULF who headed

the New Orleans Astronomers.Club.

In 1956,

LEE, HARVEY OSWALD attempted to join this club

and submitted an application which was refused. COMPTON related

that after the assassination, MR. WULF turned over this applica-

tion to the F.B.I.

COMPTON stated that shortly after the assassination..

DAVE FERRIE called MR. WULF and inquired if he knew anything

about LEE HARVEY OSWALD.

COMPTON related that he couldn't figure how DAVE FERRIE

had knowledge of MR. WULF and the Astronomy Club and connecting

this with LEE HARVEY OSWALD.

COMPTON stated that he received a message that DAVE

FERRIE attempted to call him by telephone at 1:00 A.M. on the

Tuesday before he died. COMPTON returned the call at #895-9811

and received no answer.

Mr. COMPTON stated that DAVE FERRIE had never mentioned

the name of CLAY SHAW to him.. COMPTON did recall that after

Hammond and thought about this being the home town of SHAW's

parents.

TELEPHONE:

PRESENTLY EMPLOYED:

THOMAS LEWIS CLARK, WM age 19

240 ORION, METAIRIE, LOUISIANA

831-2975

CENTRY PRINTING COMPANY, 4422 TOULOUSE

In June, 1964, I met DAVE FERRIE

through my brother, STEPHEN RANDOLPH CLARK, who met FERRIE

approximately two days before I did, for a job at a filling

station he owned, (Daval's Service Station) on Vets Highway.

So I went over there and I noticed that there was something

about him that was weird, but he seemed smart and talented.

He

seemed to be all right.. I got to know him by working there and

that

is where I met JIMMY JOHNSON.

Then my brother

was

mostly with DAVE more than I was.

I really didn't get to know

DAVE until five months later and from then on we seemed to

be friends.

When I was working at the filling station, I

know I saw a small, white compact car, foreign, Renault type,

come there twice.

I couldn't maké out who it

was, but it was

big man.

DAVE told me both times that he wanted me to watch

the station while he talked with him for a few minutes.

He would

wind up staying in the car for over an hour.

The car never came

and got gas.

He just always pulled up on the side and DAVE

would walk over there and get in the car. They would be there

about an hour or so.

DAVE sold the filling station, and he

asked me if I wanted to work with him as a flight instructor

at the airport.

He was working for Saturn Aviation at that

time.

I agreed and more or less hung around out there and there

wasn't much to do. He quit and opened his own flight

school. He asked me to work with him there.

This. was 1966.

I lived with DAVE at one time for about

two months..

This was right before he died. I have been to

his apartment quite a few times.

I. Did DÄVE ever talk to you about

his activities? Like flying down to Cuba, the Bahamas?

A. He told me once he went to the Bahamas.

0. Did he do much talking about the

investigation? (Kennedy assassination)

A: He said something about you all

didn't know what

you were doing. He was in bed - sick.

REV.

At 2 P.M. March 13, 1967, Sedgebeer in company

with Niedermeier interviewed REV.. S. ARJONILLA, Pastor of St.

Hubert's Catholic Church located in Garyville, Louisiana.

Father

ARJONILLA was shown a set of photographs wherein DAVE FERRIE?

appears in order to ascertain whether or not REV. ARJONILLA

could recognize DAVE FERRIE. However, REV. ARJONILLA COuld

not identify him.

The following is a tape recording of the

conversation with REV. ARJONILLA.

"He came to the house once or twice. He was

promoting some kind of philosophy to the children. I don't

remember how many he said he had.

He was suppose to be a

theologian, studying for the priesthood but had been kicked out.

FERRIE had said. I said what philosophy for what, but he

says that he was having these youngsters come around him, and he

was teaching them about God and different things and which I

was not interested in his work, you see, and once then a second

time he came to Thibodeaux and I asked him to ride with me.

I wanted to find out what was his mentality, you see.

Then

I get to

find out that he was flying a plane in New Orleans.

He was a pilot,

and I asked him what the things that a pilot

does.

But that's all, nothing else.

Sedgebeer

well, when was the last time that you remember

seeing him, Father?

Father

Eleven years.

You see, I 'm here four years

and five years in Raceland and five years in

Kenner. During that five years he was flying

a plane I think somewhere in Kenner.

He was

a pilot there and he used to come to my, church.

Niedermeier

That would be around in 1963.

Father

And some of the boys told me that he had bought it.

(referring to the plane). Then I heard

again that he had gone in prison, somebody told

me: that he went to prison. Did he?

Sedgebeer

Well, he was in trouble.

Father

In trouble or something.

Sedgebeer

Yes, right there in Kenner right by the airport.

Rev. S. ARJONILLA.

I was pastro of Kenner then,

he used to come to my church there.

I was surprised to learn that he was a devout

Catholic toward the end there.

He died?

You mustn't read the papers.

Is that the same fellow we're talking about?

Yes:

I don't know it was the same fellow.

I don't know

him by his name. I don't remember his name.

You never heard from him in 1963?

NO

Were you pastor in 1963?

Yes, I was six years in Kenner, but I don't

remember what year I was in Kenner.

well, you didn't remember any people coming

to you saying that they were referred to you by

FERRIE?

He had a bunch of boys and they used to go to

his house and some of the boys I said you know son

that's not good. The man that's teaching you about

God is not favorable, not good.

That was the last

I heard :

When I heard from him he was in some

trouble.

The next time I heard from him again he

came to my house and said, Father, I use to be a

theologist, a philosopher. .:.. so I was very

glad to hear that he was a theologian.

He lived

somewhere around Kenner, he had a farm there

teaching some young men some kind of subject in

aeronautics or something, I don't know.

Then one day I asked him to come with me to Thibo-

deaux as a ride and then I would like to learn

more about his theology and we

talked.

'I had'

some other fellow in the car with me then we went

back to Kenner, and he went home and that's

the last I saw of him. And you say that was the

same fellow?

Yes

I went to Kenner and from Kenner I went to Raceland

and I lived in

Raceland for five years then I came

here.

He knew many religious because as he was a religious

philosopher and theologian and in the secular

churches, I think he was about to become a sub-deacon

but he didn't make the grade and then he went out.

I don't know the reason why. I didn't ask him.

But he has known various people in other words he

He classed himself as a psychologist in the direc-

his main living was derived from flying,

piloting an aircraft.

In New Orleans, I know. I being the pastor, he

visited me, you see, he come and say hello and wanted

to make himself known to me. The second time I

heard of him he was having a group of young men whom

he was teaching them certain things about God and

so and so, but I did not favor it because I did not

think he came in the right period and said, well"

father I would like to have you help me in teaching

catechism. I would have encourged him to come and

help him along, you see, but he didn't come.. He had

his own way of thinking.

The name LEE HARVEY OSWALD doesn't mean anything to

you?

I don't know.

Was FERRIE ever in the company of someone when he

came to visit you. Was he always by himself?

Yes, always by himself. He really gives an impression.

He comes to church in a uniform.

He gives a very

good impression.

What kind of uniform was he wearing, black?

Black sometimes jet black when he was in the service

at the airport in the airlines.

Regular commercial line uniform.

It never rang a bell when this person died.

You never noticed his eyebrows appeared to be glued

on or painted or make-up on his face.

No, I didn't notice.

for several years before that since the 40's at

least.

He must have been moving around because at the last

part, he came to Kenner to live near the airport,

you see.

That must have been around 1956.

I have five years in Raceland and I have three years

here, that is nine years, huh?

Yes, the latter part of that year.

Was that '63.

We left in '58

oh, '58, then you went to Raceland. Then you had

no reason to believe that he was preaching anything

but for the good of the religion but he just wasn't

qualified.

I found this, that if he had come to me and help me,

never knew the Ferrie that came to see me was the

same.

Well, you probably wouldn't have recognized his

picture.

Something happened to all his hair; he was balder

than a cue-ball. He pasted his eyebrows on.

I know he had a bald head. This is how I know him.

That is all I wanted to find out that maybe OSWALD

had visited you, but information I got, he did,

when these boys got in trouble, he was actually

telling them to come and see you, you were a very

good friend.

He came twice, once to recommend himself to me for

my disposal if I wanted to use him for religious

purposes but I told him he could, but he never came.

He had his own thing. I never saw him anymore.

MR. GILL:

I am not at all too familiar with these

hearings, and, again, this 1s, frankly, my first appearance; but

having given a lot of attention and thought to this gentleman's.

position, I deem It only consistent that before proceeding with

the hearing we file with you what we consider something represent-

ing his appropriate rights; then the Petition for show of Good

Faith and Clean Hands-- those arent in proper order-- but, as 1

say, this 1s my first time-- I have an extra copy if you gentlemen

should want it-- and then this other one.

My reference in one of those documents was with the

1dea

of setting a case for hearing, and it was my understanding

was just to agree to the hearing and not by any agreement on

our part to waive any rights of Captain Ferrie. That 1s the

reference I made in there.

MR. BELL: Before we go any further, let me make

it clear just where we are as far as this matter goes.

When Captain Ferrie was originally removed from

flight status, we informed him at that time that we would take

no further action until the criminal charges had been duly

processed, at which time we would determine what

action we shold

take.

We have not made any such decision, and we are

currently investigating Captain Ferrie in order to determine the

facts necessary for the Company to make a decision

as to what

action should be taken in his case.

Such investigations have been a fairly common thing

over the last six or eight months where a captain or a pilot has

been

involved

In some difficulty and where we have had an informal

hearing, sometimes with the

record being kept, sometimes without,

and this has been held by appropriate

companies and officials to

determine if any action should be taken or whether no action at

all is warranted.,

Many times the investigation 1s the end of 1t and

no action at all 1s taken. Many times

the investigation 1s made

for written charges being filed and some action taken against the

Company.

Every employes is entitled to some type of Investigation

prior to the company taking any action.

The fact that certain allegations have been made

should not be sufficient, but he

should have his chance to come

in to tell the story prior to the Company taking any action, to

appear as a part of his record thereafter; and that is the status

of Captain Ferrie today.

This is

an investigation to determine what his

side of the story 1s, and a good portion of what we want

to

Investigate today arises

out of not only the criminal charges

that were brought against him, but as a result of those criminal

charges we

attempted to make a thorough investigation of Captain

Ferrie's past and present activity.

Certain facts came to our attention in the course

of that investigation which had revealed an indication of serious

discrepancies between Captain Ferrie's history as he informed

US

of

It and as we knew of 1t at

the time

he was hired and during

the time he has continued in our employment; certain facts that

raised serious questions in our mind about his emotional diff1-

culties over the past and about those

that have continued to the

present time, and certain facts that indicate the possibility of

serious physical difficulties.

We would like to discuss these problems with

Captain Ferrie today. We would like to have him go aver some of

his past history and discuss these alleged facts that have come to

our attention.

Now, this 1s only a part of an investigation, but

1t is a very important

part in determining what final action will

be taken by the Company.

As I understand it, one of the important

points will be how frank and honest he is with us today, and when

we check these facts against ours and further investigation, as to

what he tells us, how much of that will stand up.

MR. GILL: I find no fault with anybody here on a

personal basis, and I don't want you to misinterpret what' I say,

with anybody at all conducting the investigation; but we tried to

get specifications as to what they wanted investigated today so

we would be better prepared and not depend on the memory of

Captain

Ferrie years ago, and,

as you know, Mr. Bell, that was denied me;

and, as I say, I am not finding any fault on a personal basis,

because that is the way it should be conducted, and that 1s the

way

1t 1s; but you can consider our position this morning.

We know nothing and we are not prepared on any

basis to furnish any proof or to check any recollection or any-.

thing. Then, also, it seems to me that if that 1s the thought

and there Is some idea

about his having violated some confidence

or rule or regulation prior to this incident that has been com-

plained of, that a regular charge, a specification, should be

lodged and properly interrogated about

and investigated; but for

the Company now to go into something that is in the relative past,.

before this situation that brought about his suspension, I think

you should be denied that as a matter of law, wherein that his

rights of privacy cannot be invaded and that anything to do with

any alleged misconduct has to be on the job and not off the job;

and anything with reference to his scope of morality that did.

actually interfere with his duties can't

be inquired into, and

anything concerni " moral turpitude could not be inquired into

unless it 1s within the scope of his employment.

As I say, In order to be able to answer anything--

we came here as a matter of courtesy, and in answer to what we

considered a formal demand; but I contest and challenge the right

to inquire into those things until we can know specifically what

It 1s, and maybe it 1s something that would come within the purview

or scope of his employment, and, if so, then you would be entitled

to inquire. Into it and he ustly would have to answer, otherwise,

I don't think he would have to.

As I

say, I don't consider it a question of his

display of fairness or co-operation

at this time, because he was

suspended for a particular purpose; and that purpose has been

removed. I tried one case and he was found not guilty, and the

other cases were dismissed against him.

MR. BELL: One case was actually tried?

MR, GILL:

Yes, sir. We tried a case and a plea

of not gullty was entered by the Court. We did try the case

before Judge McCurs, and what happened-- as I say, I don't say

this with any reference of any wrongdoing on the part of the

District Attorney, because I know him, and I know all of them

over there, and they are very fair and splendid people-- but we

filed motions for a Bill of Particulars on each and every day that

Captain Ferrie was charged with committing an offense, and he

was

actually on flight duty and up in the air in one of your airplanes.

MR. BELL:

Which case was he found not guilty of?

MR. GILL: I will get it our for you. When that

was made known to the District Attorney by his checking the records

In your office in New Orleans, then the boys were called back in

and they were under excellent tutelage at that time by two vicious

detectives from New Orleans;

and

the boy remembered

other dates;

and we went in and beat one of those and

showed that they were

absolutely false and positively untrue.

The District Attorney then finally got a hold of

the other young man in the case and had him come in to his office

and interrogated him, and I understand he spoke to you on the

telephone; and this young man told the District Attorney how he

was brought in this situation by these detectives and he said that

1t was basically untrue;

and that having been cleared up, I think

Captain Ferrie 1s ready

for reinstatement, unless you have any-

thing else.

If you do, then I think this is the proper time and

forum to file them.

MR. BELL:

we understood from the. District Attorneys

In both Parishes that both cases were nol-prossed.

MR. GILL:

That is correct, except for the first one

I tried in New Orleans, and you have that record. We sent it to

you, showing a plea of not guilty. If you have them here, I can

point 1t out to you.

that.

MR. GILL: He was found not guilty by Judge McCune.

MR. BELL: Let us understand one thing. With an

airline captain we belleve that the matters which bear on his job

are much wider than, for example, 1f he was a

cleaner out here that

cleans our hallways; and things like mental problems, whenever they

come to light, are going to be looked into very thoroughly.

MR. GILL: But that was not the cause of his su...

jension.

What you are talking about is money and the right to be

reinstated; and once that has been straightened out, then if there

is another cause for removal, that should be an extra hearing. He

has his constitutional rights now, and we can't abate them or.

violate them; 1t just can't be done.

MR. BELL:

Well, you have filed a grievance abo

the matter of reinstatement which will be processed. The Company's

position 1s that 1t 1s going to continue its investigation and then

determine what final action 1s going to be taken in the case of

Captain Ferrie.

MR. GILL: Well, I have hesitated to go into Court

on 1t because I hoped we would settle it, but I have

already

prepared the

cases, as you will see from some of these pleadings;

and this man is on the beach and he 1s in a hell of a fix finan-

cially. If 1t hadn't been for me, he wouldn't have known what to

do. He is a very splendid man, a very smart and brilliant person

and he has done a lot of research work for me, done It very well

and creditably. If it wasn't for the fact that I was able to help

him, I don't know what he would have done.

MR: BELL: Well, I think your position is clear,

.

and I think our position 1s clear.. Now, we. are ready to proceed,

If Captain Ferrie agrees

to answer our questions.

MR. GILL:

Suppose you tell me what you would like

to know so I will know whether I should acvise him-- I mean to let

him proceed blindly into the interrogation which you have prepared,

and where you are sitting behind the gun, so to speak; and if he

not only doesn't know what you want to know, but he probably can't

answer your questions unless he is given some time, and, secondly,

think the time for specifications and charges on those specifi-

cations has elapsed, 1t has gone by. I don't think you have a

right to question him, but 1f you tell me what It 1s, please, s^,

and I say this with all deference and respect, we might talk with

him and see if there is something that doesn't invade his privacy

which comes within the purview of your proper investigation, then

I will advise him to answer.

MR. BELL: The first thing I would Ilke for him to

give us 1s a quick summaryof his educational background starting

with his college wirk.

Mh, GILLy well, that 1s something that you could

have told me something about over the telephone when I talked to

you some time ago. I think that 1s his private life and something

that has already been gone into.

I think if you will check those cases (Indicating),

you will find out that you have no right to ask him that. If he

wants on his own to answer it and believes that his memory 1s

accurate enough, why, that 1s up to him; but I don't think he has

to

answer 1t.

MR. BELL:

I want to make lt very clear to you that

we have tested these things before the neutrals and we have a clear

neutral's decision that

we are entitled to inquire into facts which

bear upon the man's duties and qualifications on the job, and

refusal to answer these questions and to co-operate In this 1n-

vestigation 1s in itself a separate and

distinct ground for

disciplinary action.

MR. GILL: Could you do this, Mr. Bell, could you

gIve us a l1ttle memorandum-- we will take it down-- I am not

trying to ask that you write it- so we will know

exactly what

you want to know, and let us talk it over with him?

MR. BELL: No. I can give you a general outline.

I am going to Inquire into his educational background, I am going

to inquire into his physical background, I am going to inquire into

any history of mental problems, I am going to inquire into certain

charges that were brought against him in New Orleans.

MR. GILL: What is that neutral's decision? Would

YOU

so I might check it for my own edification?

MR. BELL: " I will furnish you with a copy of 1t.

It is in the matter of O'Neil versus I.M.

it 1s in the matter of O'Ne1l.

situation in light of that decision.

(Document is handed to Mr. G1ll.)

MR. GILL: Can we have about ten minutes alone with

this gentleman in an office so we can go over this?

MR. BELL:

You can use this office, if you llke.

MR. GILL: Thank you,

was taken, after which

the following proceedings were had:)

waiver. I don't think we have a right to waive lt and I don't

believe he should. In the absènce of that, I don't see how he can

answer your questions.

are sought

Courts are not the neutrals, but that the Railroad Adjustment

Board has jurisdiction.

So here we have a situation where this gentleman

has given his physical background years

ago and his educational

background years ago, and 1f a copy of those can be furnished to

you and you wish to ask specific guestions

about. It, where he may

have made a mistake or an error or misstatement of fact, why, we

will try to give you whatever we can; but in the. absence of that,

we don't know what he said; we don't know what you want, we don't

have the questions.

Now, about his physical background, I think that is

something that addresses Itself to the F.A. A. who gave him his

lloense, and I think that would be the proper forum to decide as

to his physical fitness.

But, again, you would have to give us that, and we

request the questions that you want answered; and as to his mental

problems, I don't belleve my man is capable of determining mental

problems for himself.. That would be something that you would have

to ask him questions about under different circumstances at

different instances and then give him a chance to explain it, and

that then

would come under the prerogative of a psychiatrist. I

think we should have one present, if that is going to be gone into.

If you want a physical, I think you have a right. to ask for that;

and then go to the proper department to check his mental capacity

at the time as to the charges in New Orleans.

the departments have furnished you with the proper information

because,

as I say, he did go to trial and was found not guilty on

the one charge and the other charges were then thereafter dismissed,

based primarily upon the fact that he had been found not guilty in

the original case and

also by statements from that young man. I

think you have a letter from him and a call from him, stating that

It was basically untrue.. I think that has beenexplained in the

correspondence that you have..

I think Captain Ferrie's answer would be that he was

found not guilty on one and the others were dismissed.

He plead not

gullty and wasn't gullty of them. Again, If you would ask specific

questions on that, we would try to answer; so if you would give

them

to us, we will see if we can get him to answer them for you.

I don't want to waive our right to object to any specifications;

because I don't think that you can give them now and demand that

they be answered because of the lapse of time prior to the filing

of the original letter to come here; and, secondly, I say we can't

waive anything for him and don't want to continue that way.

Last but not least, I think that the only reason

why we should in any way try to acquiesce in answering any specific

questions you might propound would be in a spirit of co-operation,

but I don't think that applies at all.: This decision was somethi

that had to do on the grounds of the Company, and certainly they

had a right to inquire; and, secondly, had this gentleman who

decided this case had the law available to him, I don't think he

them, and,

second, if we want to answer them, and, third, if answering any

speoiflo question would hurt his legal position in the Court, and,

if so, I would advise him not to answer them. Only when we get

them can we make the determination as to what we will do. I don't

want to mislead you by saying we will answer them, I don't know;

but I think that we are entitled to that because this man-- you

have his application, you have all of the answers that you asked;

and I think we should at least be furnished with a copy of that,

too, along. with your questions; because until we get that, we don't

know what we are doing.

It 1s just like the question, 1f you quit beatin

your wife. If you answer it yes, you must have been beating her,

you couldn't have stopped. So unless we know

what we are doing,

just can't answer the questions.

I don't mean that anybody is

trying to pose any trickery, I don't mean that at all; but 1f this

man was your client, you would want that.

MR. BELL:

Do. you understand that you can

supplement

any answers that he gives today, if you feel they should be supple-

mented at a later time?.

One of the purposes of having this hearing

1s to hear from Captain Ferrie himself directly, his answers to

these questions; and you also understand that acting as representa-

tive of the Company, weare at this time directing Captain Ferrie

to co-operate with us in this investigation, and we are directing

him at

this time to answer the questions.

The first question which has been posed to him was

to outline his college education to us.

MR. GILL: You see, 1t 1s just. Ilke having a man

that has both legs broken and telling him to walk, and if he

doesn't walk, he can be punished. You won't give him a crutci,

and I Insist you give him a crutch since you are asking him

specific questions. You cannot ask him to be an instrument of

his own conviction or destruction, because he may leave something

out and he may forget something.

If you have his original application and the

original documents that he signed, 11 you will give that to us

now and if there is anything about that. that you wish to question

him, why, I wili advise him to answer.. But unless we know what

you want-- I mean, you have no right to go on a fishing expedition

at his expense..

CAPTAIN FERRIE: May I Interrupt? I will co-operate

with the Company within the framework of the agreement existing

between the Company and the Alr Line Pilots Association and not

outside of 1t.

MR. BELL: I am going to ask you some direct

questions and I would like you to either answer them or not answer

them, but I want the questions recorded.

MR. GILI: Would you deny or refuse us the documents

that we asked for or will you furnish them? I want the documents

that he signed, any and every document he signed tending to bear

upon the questions that you will question him about. I can't order

them, but I think we should have them.

MR. BELL:

We are not going to furnish them at this

time. I am going to ask him direct questions.

Did you, during the period of 1938 to 1940 attend

St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland, Oh10?

MR: GILL;

"I don't think he ought to answer your

question unless you let him know whether he

said that before or

not.

I don't think you ought to be permitted to ask any questions

blindfolded.

MR. BELL:

As far as the Company can see, how he

answered the question before has no bearing on whether he did or

did not.

MR. GILL: I don't think you have a right to go

Into all of his previous conduct. If you feel that he has done

something wrong,

you should make the charges. You had investigators

out, and some. of them offered one of these witnesses $100 to frame

this man.

It hasn't been too nice, and--

MR. BELL: Would you give us the name of the witness?

MR. GILL: Jack Martin.

MR. BELL: • Martin?

MR. GILL: Yes, s1r. That 1s correct, Isn't 1t?

CAPTAIN FERRIE: Yes.

MR. GILL: And they have been handling some of the

other witnesses a little rough, Ilke police would do in a line-up.

As I say, they haven't treated this man exactly right, and I would

want a hearing and I think we ought to have what we get in Court.

If this was. a Court proceeding, I would be entitled to a Bill of

Particulars.

You would have to give that to me.

MR. BELL: Mr. Gill, as

I have informed you several

times, we have not decided whether any charges are warranted

against Captain Ferrie or not, what final action should be taken

has not been decided.

We are attempting to make an investigay_on.

MR. GILL:: But, you seem

to have the investigation

already completed in your mind, Mr. Bell. If you had a son that

was being interrogated;

don't you think he should have what he

signed before?

Don't you think that is simple fairness?

I do.

would give lt to you.

You seem to have your decision already made because

there is something about:

MR. BELL:

That is right.

Would you tell us 1f you ever attended St. Charles

Seminary In Ohio? To our best recollection, he stated in the

application form that he did.

MR. GILL: I would respectfully request that all

the questions be deferred until we get the application about which

he is being questioned.

MR. BELL:

I will have to tell you, Mr. Gill, that

many of these questions do not have anything to do with the

application form; they have to do with other activities.

MR. GILI: The law says that you can't do that.

MR. GILL: Without waiving any rights of his that

we can.

MR. BELL:

I would like toask him if he attended

St. Mary's Seminary during the period of 1938 to 1940 1n Cleveland,

Ohio.

MR. GILL.

Is that on here (indicating)?

MR. BELL:

It doesn't appear. on there.

MR. GILL:

If this is for the purpose of trying to

show a mental aberation, I don't think this is the proper forum.

I think we should have a pyschiatrist here, too, of whom we may

ask questions, 1f that 1s the purpose of 1t. I am trying to figure

out why you want it, and you tell me a reason; but you haven't

asked something about mental stability here.

I figure that 1s your

reason.

MR. BELL:

Are you refusing to answer the question

on behalf of Captain Ferrie or not? Will he answer the question?

CAPTAIN FERRIE: Within the framework of the con-

tract and the law as stipulated, I will be happy to; outside of

the provisions of the contract and the law, I shall not.

the question? I think that is only fair, and then I will advise

MR. BELL: If It 1s true that he did, I want to

you are foolish, don't misunderstand me-- secondly, if there 1s

any reason as to why he was dismissed for any mental aberation,

good falth, said that he did.

MR. BELL: I do take 1t that on his behalf you are

advising him

to refuse to answer it?

MR. GILI: We refuse to answer because It is not

question, first of all, that he could answer, that the records

of that place would be the best

evidence, and testimony from

people there would be the best evidence, and glving us the right

to cross-examine them to see if there was a matter of any definite

reason

as stated on the record or whether it was just prejudice

or some other reason.

As I just stated about the handwriting expert, a

lot of times people in good faith make'a conscientious mistake.

I don't think he 1s a person to whom that question should be

addressed. I think it 1s an improper question

In the sense that

It shouldn't be asked of him, and I, as his attorney, tell him he

would not be falling to co-operate to refuse to answer the question.

MR. BELL:

Have you ever been treated for emotional

problems by a doctor?

I advise him to refuse to answer for the

same reason.

CAPTAIN FERRIE: I am refusing to answer on the

grounds previously stated, that 1f you will stick inside of the

federal law, the decisions of the Court and the contract, I will

be happy to answer it; but when you violate the law and the con-.

tract, I cannot. I consider that a waiver of my rights.

MR. GILL:

And, secondly, I advise him that he

shouldn't answer on his constitutional, prerogative and because of

the nature of the questions and the nature of the inquiry,

MR. BELL.

Were you ever under the care of Dr.

Wilfred Gill in Cleveland, Ohio?

MR. GILL:

Same reason.. In other words, should he

say yes and should he say that he was dismissed because of some

questiop of he didn't conform to the seminary work - well, once I

studied for the Episcopal ministry and thought I would llke it.

Well, I didn't like 1t, That doesn't mean I am crazy, I don't

belleve. But, anyway, It ta something that should be better in-

quired of the people that had an interest in the matter.

You must

have some evidence. If you are seeking to pursue it the way you

are-- and I don't mean to criticise your method of inquiry, Mr.

Bell, I don't mean It that way-- but I don't think that this is

something that this man should be called upon to answer in the

absence of records and people that can place themselves before you

not making any allegations he ever attended Sunnyside Flying School

MR. GILL. It shouldn't bepursued. Being

a lawyer

myself, I know the hazards of answers that are given inproperly and

given too quickly..

We don't know what we are doing. Mr. Ferrie

doesn't remember at this time about this flying school you asked

about.

Maybe after some short deliberation, he may have some recol

lection. He might have known somebody there, maybe somebody who

has a feeling of enmity. I think he should have these in writing

since you have them, and apparently you have a great number of them;

I see where that forms no part of an

I guess he could have anything; but I don't see where that has

anything to do with the hearing.

MR. BELL:

Are you stating he 1s a

Ph.d., or

did

you say if he was?

MR. GILL: I understand he is a Ph.D..

MR. BELL: Captain Ferrie, would you tell us where.

and at what college you obtained any Ph.D.?

CAPTAIN FERRIE: If you put the question in writingas

in the contract, I will be happy to answer 1t, Mr. Bell. Stick

within the contract and the law, and I will co-operate. As long

as you don't, I cannot.

by the Benedict High School in Cleveland, Ohio?

MR. GILL: There is no use in you wasting your time

or we wasting ours or these other gentlemen's time unless you give

us something in writing, so that I can tell him what I think 1s

right and wrong for him to answer.

You have the questions and you

won't give them to us, and I have asked you for them quite some

time ago and you told me that I couldn't get them.

This is just

an inquiry. Now, you named four things here and you have, ap-

parently, five or six pages of questions, and I will advise him

to co-operate with you tothe fullest extent, and he said that he

would co-operate if you would come within the four walls of the

You have questions to ask, and I should know what

you are talking about because it may be that after we get into them

he will answer every question; but I think we should have a fight

to sit down and know what he is called upon to do. He has hla

constitutional prerogative, It can't be taken away from him no

matter how much we may try..

I am going to advise him, unless you do give us the

questions and if we can be called upon to answer them, that there

1s no use in going into It any further,

and 1t. 1s not a refusal to

co-operate on his part; it 1s a refusal upon yours. You are re-

fusing to co-operate by giving us a fair chance to make a fair

answer.

There 1s no trickery to be resorted to, and I know

you don't intend it that way, but that is the summation.

MR. BELL:

I informed you previously that 1f you

feel that the answers that he gives now need to be supplemented,

you can at a later date supplement them.

MR. GILL: I won't know what these questions are

necessarily at a later date.. If you give them to me and if we can

keep them an hour, maybe we can answer them; or if we can maybe

I can't talk

to him every time you ask a question

and decide whether It is a proper thing to do. One question may

go into the other. I don't see how we can go on with 1t.. I see

no reason to go on..

MR. GILL:: If you insist we stay, we will stay; but

that is my advice to him now as to every question,

MR. BELL: Captain Ferrie, you previously stated

in writing to the Company that the cause of these arminal charges

being filed against you in New Orleans was the Influence of a

Communist state in local government.

MR. GILL:

same objection, sir.

Is that the cause --

MR. BELL:

Captain Ferrie, you previously indicated

to the Company in writing that you know the pames of Communist

fellow travelers employed by Eastern Alf Lines.

would you give us

the names?

CAPTAIN FERRIE;

You are out of your jurisdiction.

MR. GILL: Wait. I think that 1s something that

should not be Inquired Into here.

I think that is a prerogative

of the FBI or a secret hearing. I certainly advise him to keep

that

to himself.

MR. BELL: It is your position then that any

Communist employees that he knows of that are in the employ of

Eastern Air Lines,

and you so state, that he has a right to keep

MR.: GILL: • Definitely not, but I think inquiry has

It 1s going to be in a public record. I don't think we should

MR. GILL:

Because this can, and very likely surely

will become part of the Federal Court record, and I think that

should be handled-- I am trying to talk to Captain Ferrie privately

and quietly where nothing is being as a matter of a hearing except

the notes you are taking down.

MR. BELL:

All right.

Will you answer those

questions If we go off the record?

MR: GILL: I advise him not to. It doesn't come

within the prerogative of this investigation.

MR. BELL: If during the course of the Company's

Investigation It should determine that/a part of this investigation

that it wants you to take a complete physical and mental

examiia

tion, would you be willing to do that by doctors selected by the

Company and at the Company's expense?

tract says.

CAPTAIN TOMPKINS: Mr. Bell should

certainly know

that.

He deals with 1t all the time.

MR GILL:

What does the contract hold, Mr. Bell?

MR. BELL: The Company normally, if they have any

questions about physical condition, they have a right to-- mental

condition as we interpret 1t-- they have a right to have the man

examined. If the man does not agree with the results of that

examination, he can have an examination by his own set of physicians;

and if they disagree with the Company's physicians, they get to-

gether and select a third set of physicians who make the final

examination.

MR. GILL:

Well, since the matter 1s in the con-

tract, it 1s a matter of choice with him, the one that he 1s called

upon to answer, I say that they have a right to do 1t; but he would

certainly; I imagine, resist it under the light of the fact that

they are trying to keep from paying him all that money. I don't

think he should say anything that may imperil his position in any

way at all.

CAPTAIN FERRIE:"I didn't say that.

MR. GILL: I think you have correspondence in your

files with Mr. Martin. He 1s a private investigator, and that is

In your letter from him in your files, stating just what he does.

As I say, I don't think Mr. Ferrie should answer

any questions as of now because of the failure to provide us with

Captain Ferrie, the Company has a right

Bell.

That 1s for a Court to determine.

MR. BELL: It 1s the Company's position that 1t has

this right and 1s directing you to answer these questions.

CAPTAIN FERRIE: It 1s my position and understanding

that the Company does have the fight to ask me those questions, in

that I concur, in writing, th accordance with the contract.

MR. BELL:

Well, 1n all fairpess to you, so we make

no mistake, there 1s no requirement in the contrapt at all that

these questions be put in writing.

section A, Paragraphs 2 and 4.

Well, the contract is there,

but it is

a

part of this record now. I want it to be very clear that you

have been directed to answer these questions.

questions that have been put to you?

CAPTAIN FERRIE: Can I answer It once again? I

will be very happy to answer these questions--

MR. GILL:

Let me make the answer, please. I don't

think the answer 1s his prerogative. He hasn't refused to answer

these questions, except at my direction as a legal proposition and

not as a mattero tending to show any lack of co-operation on his

part.

If you had given me the questions in writing, we

might have had some answers for some of them; and some of them I

don't think should be answered, or the answer would have been no;

but having failed to do that, my position is that whether it is

within the contract or whether it isn't, since you have questions

you intend for him to answer and some of them go back to his child-

hood, it is that we should have been given those questions in

advance as you do have them in writing, and apparently have had

them for sometime. That is the legal position and factual position,

too.

MR. BELL: Does anybody have any questions? In

view of the position taken by Captain Ferrie through his attorney,

It would serve no further purpose to continue this hearing.

MR. GILL: May I ask, 1s that all the questions you

had intended to ask him?

MR. BELL:

No.

MR. BELL:

I think we have reached the position

where it is clear that he' doesn't intend to answer any questions.

I want to again make it clear that if he wants to answer, if he

wants to co-operate with the Company, today is the time to do 1t.

MR. GILL: Of course, your co-operation 1s not

necessarily, I don't belleve, the correct one, Mr. Bell. If you

will continue the interrogation and let us know what all the

questions are, I think we are entitled to that. This is a hearing,

and you are supposed to ask him anyway, so we will know what they

are; and I will be talking to Mr. Ferrie after this hearing, and

if there 1s any desire to reconvene It, I will call you. It is

up to you, of course, whether or not you would; but I think all of

the questions should be asked, at least so we know what our accusers

are saying, not have another hearing.

We hope to handle this matter amicably. I know

Eastern is not afraid of me, I don't mean 1t that way; but. we have

to terminate it one way or the other shortly, and I know that 1s

what you want done, and that is what we will have to do, and I

think we ought to know what your questions are.

That was the

purpose of the meeting.

are going to answer

them 1s another matter.

I think we should

know what they are. I ask that you tell us that now.

MR. BELL:

You were not called here to hear our

questions. This meeting was held to

give Captain Ferrie an

opportunity to.make

any explanations he would like to make in

regard to certain matters that have come to our attention in order

that he might further express these matters.

Captain Ferrie, on your advice, has chosen not to

answer the questions.

CAPTAIN FERRIE: That 1s an incorrect statement, Mr.

Bell.

Let the record show it.

MR. GILL: I would say this, Mr. Bell, since we are

here to answer the questions and maybe we may answer some of your

questions, we don't know-- the chances are we won't-- but, at the

same time, I think we are entitled to know what they are.

At this

time you refuse to give them to us in writing. I think we ought

to know. Maybe if we hear all of them, I might well change my

position; but to keep running Into names of Communists within the

scope of the investigation 1s not what I think should be answered:

It may well be, but I think-- I ask you to ask the questions, 1f

you will.

MR. BELL:

I want to point out to you that it was

Captain Ferrie who brought up the explanation on these criminal

charges being

based on Communists.

answer these and tell his story before the three Individuals who

have the responsibility for the Company to make these decisions.

Now, you do not get the same type of advantage out

of preparing a list of written questions which then

are taken off

and the answers are written up at a different time. We have a

right to investigate the matter in what we determine is the most

proper

FEBRUARY 28, 1967

TO :

FROM:

RE :

JIM GARRISON, DISTRICT ATTORNEY

ANDREW SCIAMBRA AND LOUIS IVON

INTERVIEW WITH DAVID FERRIE

On Saturday, February 18, 1967 at approximately 3:30

P.M., Louis Ivon and I interviewed David FERRIE in his apartment

on Louisiana Avenue Parkway.

As we approached the house, FERRIE came out on the

porch and looked at us and began to walk down the steps to open

the front door for us.

As he opened the door for us, he told

Ivon that he was glad that we finally decided

to come and talk

with him as he had been trying to get in touch with Garrison or

Ivon for several days. He told me hello and

asked me what I was

doing with Ivon and I explained to him that I was

an Assistant

D. A. now and thought that I would come along with Ivon since we

knew each

other

from the airport.

He told us to go on upstairs and that he would follow

us, but that it would take him some time to climb up the stairs

as he was sick, and weak and that he had: not been able to keep

anything on his stomach for a couple of days.

He moaned and

groaned with each step he took up the

stairs from the bottom to

the top. This behavior by FERRIE impressed me as phoney act and

I am sure that he was not as sick as he pretended to be.

Once inside the apartment, Ivon and I sat down and

FERRIE laid down on the sofa in the front room.

He was wearing

pants and a T-shirt and had two pillows under him;

HH 54756. Docid: 32263970 Page 95

## Page 96

There was a young man in the apartment in his early

twenties who was

a friend of FERRIE's from the Lakefront Airport.

His name is BURT JOHNSON and I remember him from when I was

working out there.

FERRIE had given him flying instructions and

he told me that he had already acquired his license.

My first conversation with FERRIE centered arouna

airport talk and about people we both knew from the airport. He

said that he had often wondered what had happened to me and that

he though I had gone into private practice. He said that he

knew a lot of ex-D.A.'s and they were all dumb, with a few

exceptions.

He then said that the reason that he had called us was

that he was getting concerned over our investigation. He had

heard all kinds of rumors that he was going to get arrested and

that he wanted to find out if these rumors were true.

He said

that as a result of these rumors, he had been asked to leave the

airport and now he was concerned over how he was going to make a

living, that flying was his only enjoyment in life.

FERRIE said

he was suffering from encyphilitis and that he could not get

any

rest because of the radio, IV and press boys hounding him to

death. FERRIE said his phone rings from morning 'til night and

that he had talked to Sam DiPino from Channel 12 until the early

hours of the morning.

FERRIE said Sam was trying to con him,

but that he was too smart to fall for his line, and that all of

those people were "bastards". Just then the phone rang and it was

a reporter from the Times-Picayune, and he said that he would

positively not grant interviews

and that he was tired of all those

bastards calling him up. The reporter must have told him some-

thing, because he said that he was not calling him a bastard

- 2-

H 51756 DQpId: 32263970 Page 96

## Page 97

personally, but was referring to the

news media in general. He

then hung up the telephone.

FERRIE picked up the Picayune paper and said he wanted

to show us portions of the story that really disturbed him. He

said the newspapers can kill anybody when they want to, and that

it was never more evident than in the cases of CARLOS MARCELLO

and JIMMY HOFFA. FERRIE said the newspapers tried to frame both

of these guys. He then talked about the MARCELLO trial that he

was working on in 1963, and how the newspapers tried to crucify

MARCELLO. He said MARCELLO made asses out of all of them when

he was acquitted.

FERRIE said he wanted to know why we brought

MIGUEL TORRES back from Angola. He said that he knew what people

would do to get out of prison and he thought Garrison was trying

to frame-up by using MIGUEL TORRES. FERRIE said that if this

would happen, he would sue us and everybody. FERRIE said he had

been contacted by some big attorneys in Washington, D. C., and

they wanted to help him.

FERRIE also said he did not like the way Garrison was

answering questions put to him by newsmen and that Garrison

should make a definite statement and not say "No comment".

He

said the "No comment" stirs more shit than an hour's speech.

FERRIE said Garrison knew this and that he was obviously using

this for publicity. I assured him that Garrison was not trying

to frame anybody and that he was avoiding the press and he could

not say much less to the press than

"No comment". Then FERRIE

said he war.ted to talk to Garrison personally. We told him we

would try and arrange a meeting

in the near future.

FERRIE then began to curse JACK MARTIN and said MARTIN

started all of this stuff. FERRIE said MARTIN was jealous of him

because of his relationship with G. WRAY GILL and that MARTIN

was trying to ruin him (FERRIE). He said MARTIN is a screwball

HH

## Page 98

and should be locked up.

FERRIE then said Garrison had better be careful because

he knew that some people were trying to torpedo him; that he

knew of 3 people on a local level and a couple of people on a

national level who are trying to ruin him politically and are

trying to embarass him politically with this assassination

investigation. FERRIE

said he did not want to mention the names

of the local people, but Garrison should be smart enough to know

who they were. He then began to talk about FRANK KLEIN and he

inferred that this man was one of the local persons trying to

destroy Garrison.

However, when Ivon asked him if KLEIN was one

of the people he was referring to, FERRIE said that in time we

would find out.

FERRIE did say that Hoover was one of

the people

on a national level who was trying to destroy Garrison because

• Garrison has dared to criticize the Bureau and has the whole

country wondering if they are

smart

the Keystone Kops.

However, FERRIE said he was glad about this because as far as

he's concerned, all cops are bastards and that he has no use for

any of them.

FERRIE also said he had heard that some people in

Washington were talking about the investigation and that two days

before the story broke in the newspaper, some people were

saying

that Garrison would call a press conference Friday and give the

story to the press. FERRIE said he didn't want to give out any

names as he didn't want J. Edgar on his ass.too.

He then asked to speak to Garrison again because he

wanted. to see if he were serious about this whole thing,

I told

him that Garrison was more than serious and that we were checking

out all of our leads

and information. I then told FERRIE he

could tell me what he wanted to say and I would tell Garrison for

him. FERRIE said he wanted to talk to Garrison himself and look

-4-

him in the face.

I then asked FERRIE to tell me where he was on

November 22, 1963 and how he had become so involved in this.

FERRIE said it was all on account of a trip he made to Houston,

Texas on the afternoon of the 22nd to ice skate. He said that

all he wanted to do was relax after the MARCELLO trial and he

just had the urge to

go ice skating. FERRIE said, that

as it

turned out, it was the worst trip that he had ever made in his

life. I asked FERRIE what he did in Houston. FERRIE said,

"Ice skate, what else." I said, "I don't know Dave. You tell

me. " FERRIE said that I was a newcomer around

the game and that

,my office knew more about the trip than he did. FERRIE

said,

"Ask your boss. He had me arrested when I got back into town.

I was booked as a fugitive from Texas and I have never been to

Texas." I asked him to tell me about the arrest as I didn't

believe we would arrest a man who was perfectly innocent. FERRIE

told me I had a lot to learn about life and that I was a

starry-

eyed kid right out of law school and I was still believing the

inscriptions on the courthouse walls. FERRIE said that after

a

while, when you get a little smarter, you'll see that this is a

stinking world and that what I told you at the airport is true.

I told FERRIE that what he said may be true, but that still

doesn't tell me about the arrest. FERRIE said, "All right, I'll

go through the spiel again for your benefit." FERRIE said that

after he had taken his trip to Texas, he and

BEAUBOUEF and COFFEY

stopped in Alexandria and he called. G. WRAY GILL. GILL told him

the police were looking for him and that they wanted to ask bim

some questions about the assassination.

He said that then the

drove

back to New Orleans and dropped BEAUBOUEF off at his

apartment on Louisiana Avenue Parkway so that he could go up-

stairs and call some girls for them. He said that he and

COFFEY then went to the grocery store. He said that when he and

COFFEY were returning to the apartment he noticed a bunch of

cars around his apartment and a lot of people.

FERRIE said he

figured it was the police and so he went back to the store and

telephoned. FERRIE said some dumb ox answered the phone and

tried to suck him into a conversation, but he just hung up. He

said he then dropped COFFEY off and went to Hammond, Louisiana.

I asked him "Where in Hammond?" FERRIE said, "By a friend." I

asked him what friend and he burst out laughing and said, "I'll

say one thing for you, you sure try hard.". He then told me not

to try and investigate him because he could show me and my whole

office how to investigate. I didn't press the issue any further;

but later on he told me that he did not stay in a motel, but with

a friend who would remain anonymous.

"Besides", he said, "I've

got friends all over the world." I said that that was very

interesting, but that I wanted his opinion on one other small

matter. He asked, "What?" I said, "Dave, who shot the President?"

He said, "Well, that's an interesting question and I've got. my

own thoughts about it.". FERRIE then sent his friend into another

room to get an anatomy book and a pathology book and he pulled

out a sheet of paper and began to sketch on it. FERRIE drew a

sketch of the Texas School Depository and of the parade route

and of the area

in general. FERRIE said that before he would

definitely draw a conclusion, he would have to have more informa-

tion and facts. FERRIE then went into a long spiel about the

projectory of bullets in relation to height and distance.

said that different guns and shells have different projectories

and that bullets tend to drop as they are shot. FERRIE said the

Warren Commission did not have enough pertinent

scientific infor-

mation to come to an objective conclusion. He said he did not

read the Warren Report, but what he had read proved to him that

the Commission did not know what they were doing.. FERRIE went

into a long

spiel about J.F.K.'s neck wound. In the course of

his lecture on anatomy and pathology, he named every bone in the

human body and every hard and soft muscle area. He talked exten-

sively about the dermis and epidermis. FERRIE said if the same

bullet that struck. J.F.K. in the back or neck eventually struck

Connelly, that Connelly or Kennedy had to be a contortionist. He

rattled off some more scientific information in regard to

bones, and skin, and how a bullet decreases in speed when it

strikes an

object. and how the same bullet could not have possibly

caused all that damage. FERRIE said that that question would

never be answered because the doctor who performed the tracheotomy

had 10 thumbs and left unanswered the most important question of

all time.

FERRIE then laughed and said that doctors are almost

as stupid as lawyers, but that lawyers are worse because they

are

always in your pocket.

I then said, "In other words Dave, you don't buy the

'one shot theory?'" FERRIE said he wasn't saying anything because

he didn't want J. Edgar on his tail, that he had enough with

Garrison to contend with. FERRIE said that in time he would work

the whole thing out and then laughingly said that he would contact

our office.

I noticed at this point that he was in very good spirits

and was laughing and joking and even commented that he's feeling

pretty good now and that he had had 3 cups of coffee already and

hadn't thrown up yet.

FERRIE then received another phone call from STEVE

LITTLETON and his wife and joked with LITTLETON's wife about how

he knew that she had dated LEE HARVEY OSWALD and that he was

going to tell Garrison on her.

She must have told him that she

had seen his picture in the paper and he replied that he didn't

like it because it made him look unphotogenic.

She also must

have asked FERRIE if it was him that some people identified with

somebody or at some place and he said that the people are mistaken

or he had a common face. After he hung up the phone, we told him

we had to leave.

FERRIE said he had more to tell us about the

"one shot theory". We told him to save it for another day as it

was

dark already and we had to meet Garrison. I then asked him

if he would like

to tell me some more about his trip to Hammond

and he smiled and said "Go to hell".

I then asked if he stayed

with CLAY SHAW.

He said, "Who's CLAY SHAW?" I said, "All right,

if that doesn't ring a bell, how about CLAY BERTRAND?" He said,

"Who's CLAY BERTRAND?"

'I said, "CLAY BERTRAND and CLAY SHAW are

the same person.". He asked, "Who said that?" I said, "Dean

Andrews told us." He said, "Dean Andrews might tell you guys

anything. You know how Dean Andrews is."

FERRIE then started to

go into another lecture and we told him we had to go. He followed

us down the stairs and walked out on the sidewalk with

us.

FERRIE

asked Ivon to be sure and call him. Ivon assured him he would

and we left.

FERRIE

FROM: DAVID SNYDER, TIME STRINGER IN NEW ORLEANS

CATLANDIA WANIS RERUNS

¿ BEN CATE ASKED ME TO SEND FULL PARTICULARS ON DAVID WILLIAM

FERRIE.

¿ MY FIRST CONTACT WITH FERRIE WAS A TELEPHONE CALL AT 5:30 P.M.

FRIDAY, FEB• 17, FOLLOWING THE APPEARANCE OF THE STATES-ITEM'S

_ INITIAL STORY ON THE GARRISON INVESTIGATION.

HE HAD READ THE STORY AND, HE SAID, WAS TIRED OF REMAINING

SILENT ON THE INVESTIGATION. HE FELI THAI HE WAS BEING PERSECUTED

BY THE DA'S OFFICE AND HE WAS AFRAID OF ARREST.

FERRIE'S VOICE WAS NASAL AND

ALMOST INAUDIBLE. HE SAID HE WAS

PHYSICALLY SICK. DURING OUR FIRST TELEPHONE CONVERSATION HIS

! BREATHING WAS UNSTEADY.

I ASKED FERRIE WHEN I COULD SEE HIM. HE TOLD ME TO MAKE IT

SOON BECAUSE HE MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT TALKING. I TOLD

HIM I WOULD BE AT HIS HOUSE BY 6 P.M.

:. I TALKED TO HIM FOUR AND A HALF HOURS FRIDAY NIGHT. HE CALLED

ME AT LEAST ONCE EVERY DAY AFTER THAI UNTIL HIS DEATH. HE WAS

~ EXTREMELY SICK, HE SAID, WITH ENCEPHALITIS. HE WAS SCARED TO

DEATH OF ARRESI BY THE DISTRICI ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND HE WAS

— BITTERLY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NO JUSTICE FOR HIM IN THIS

WORLD.

- THE MAN INVESTIGATED ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS BY THE DA'S

OFFICE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSASSINATION MET ME AT THE DOWNSTAIRS

ENTRANCE TO HIS APARIMENT AT 3330 LOUISIANA AVE. PKWY•

HIS STEPS WERE FEEBLE AS WE CLIMBED THE STAIRS TO THE SECOND

FLOOR. HE APOLOGIZED FOR THE SLOWNESS, SAYING THAI HE WAS SUFFERING

FROM ENCEPHALITIS, BUT ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT CONTAGIOUS.

HE ALSO APOLOGIZED FOR THE CONDITION OF THE APARTMENT. HE SAID

THE PLACE WAS BEING RENOVATED.

•THE LIVING ROOM WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF STALE CIGARETTES.

EVERY ASH TRAY WAS HEAPED WITH CIGARETTE BUITS.

FURNITURE, GREASY FROM SWEAT AND DIRT, RESTED ON A LITTERED,

THREAD-BARE CARPET. AN AMERICAN FLAG STOOD IN ONE CORNER. NEXT

IO IT WAS A TYPEWRITER IN A CASE.

DRO NICHOLAS CHETTA, ORLEANS PARISH CORONER, SAID TESTS SHOWED

THAT THE SUICIDE NOTE FOUND IN THE APARTMENT WAS TYPED ON IHE

TYPEWRITER.

IT IS MY THEORY THAT FERRIE HAD JUST ABOUT DECIDED ON SUICIDE

AT THE TINE HE CALLED ME FRIDAY. HE MAY HAVE HAD THE NOTE

WRITTEN. WHEN I TALKED TO HIM, ESPECIALLY ON THE PHONE, IT

SEEMS TO ME IN RESTROPECI THAT FERRIE JUST WANTED TO CLEAR

HIMSELF, THEN CASH IN.

BUT BY THE TIME WE HAD FINISHED OUR CONVERSATION, HE HAD PERKED

UP A LITILE. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO FILE A SUIT THAT WOULD

ALLOW HIM TO SUBPOENA GARRISON AND EXPOSE THE HARASSMENT HE

(FERRIE > WAS GOING THROUGH. I ENCOURAGED HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT

IT WOULD BE A GOOD STORY IF HE DID FILE A SUIT.

BY THE TIME I LEFT HIS APARTMENT HE WAS SAYING THAT HE WOULD

PREPARE A SUIT OVER THE WEEKEND TO FILE MONDAY.

HE CALLED SUNDAY TO SAY HE PLANNED TO GET TOGETHER WITH AN

ATTORNEY ON THE SUIT. HE SAID HE WAS FEELING BETTER AND SOUNDED

BETTER.

BY MONDAY HE WAS WORKING IN AN ATTORNEYS OFFICE, TRYING TO

GET THE SUIT TOGETHER.

THE TARGET OF THE SUIT WAS VAGUE, BUT

ONE OF THOSE SUED WOULD APPARENTLY BE JACK MARTIN, A NUT AND

A SELF STYLED PRIVATE DETECTIVE WHO, HE SAID, HAD SUPPLIED

GARRISON A LIST OF NAMES, BOTH IN 1963 AND LAST YEAR TO CHECK

OUT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSASSINATION. FERRIE'S NAME WAS

ON BOTH LISIS.

BY THIS TIME FERRIE WAS READING EVERY SCRAP ON THE GARRISON

PROBE AND TAKING ALMOST A HAPPY-GO-LUCKY ATTITUDE IOWARD THE

INVESTIGATION.

IT IS WELL KNOWN IN NEW ORLEANS THAT THERE IS A RIFT BETWEEN

THE FBI OFFICE AND THE DA'S OFFICE. FERRIE HAD BEEN DOWN IO

THE FBI OFFICE MONDAY, HE SAID, IO TALK IO THE AGENIS. ONE

OF THE AGENIS TOLD HIM, "I KNOW WHERE YOU WERE THE DAY KENNEDY

WAS ASSASSINATED. YOU

WERE COOLING YOUR HEELS WITH ME IN FEDERAL

DISTRICI COURI." THIS IS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER FILE.

.. FERRIE SAID THE FBI BOYS WERE CHUCKLING ABOUT THE GARRISON

INVESTIGATION.

- FERRIE ASKED ME IF I COULD FIND OUT EXACILY WHEN OSWALD WAS

IN NEW ORLEANS. HE SAID HE NEEDED THE INFORMATION FOR HIS SUIT•

•I LOOKED THE DATES UP IN A CONDENSATION OF THE WARREN REPORT

AND GAVE IT IO HIM. HE SAID HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE GETTING IHE

•SUIT TOGETHER, BUT IT WAS APPARENILY OCCUPING MOST OF HIS DAY.

HE TALKED TO MY WIFE ON TUESDAY. HE HAD A NEW THEORY ON IHE

- TRAJECTORY OF THE BULLEIS THAT ENTERED KENNEDY'S BODY. HE WANTED

TO TAKE ME TO A TOXOLOGY LAB TO SHOW ME WHAT HE WAS TALKING

- ABOUT WITH A CADAVER. HE ALSO COMPLAINED OF HEADACHES.

BY NOW HE HAD STOPPED ASKING ME IF I IHOUGHT HE WOULD BE ARRESTED.

• HE HAD BECOME ALMOST LIKE A SPECTATOR AS FAR AS THE GARRISON

INVESTIGATION WAS CONCERNED. HE OOZED GOOD-NATURED CONFIDENCE.

I TALKED TO HIM TUESDAY EVENING AND HE HAD BEEN WAICHING A

IV NEWS SHOW WITH INTEREST. HE WAS IN A GOOD MOOD. WEDNESDAY

- HE WAS DEAD.

THE CHANGE IN ATTITUDE OVER THE SPACE OF ALMOST A WEEK LEADS

• ME TO BELIEVE THAI HE WAS ATLOW EBB WHEN HE CALLED BUT HAD

DECIDED TO LIVE AND FIGHT BACK AFTER ALL. FOR THIS REASON,

¿ NATURAL DEATH IMMEDIATELY MADE MORE SENSE THAN SUICIDE.

HE LEFT A LONG NOTE, ONLY TWO PARAGRAPHS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

¿ MADE PUBLIC. IT HAS BEEN DÉSCRIBED AS PHILOSOPHICAL IN NATURE.

THE CENTER OF THINGS IN FERRIE'S APARTMENT WAS A COFFEE IABLE

~ PLACED IN FRONI OF THE COUCH. IT HELD AN OVERLOADED ASHTRAY

AND A CLUSTER OF BOTTLES CONTAINING PILLS AND LIQUID MEDICINE.

- THE DA'S OFFICE SAID 15 BOTTLES OF MEDICINE WERE FOUND IN THE

APARTMENT. I WOULD SAY THERE WERE THAI MANY ON THE TABLE.

~ ON FRIDAY, AT LEAST, II WAS THE ROOM OF A MAN WHO HAD GIVEN UP.

FERRIE EITHER PROPPED HIMSELF AGAINST THE ARM OF THE SOFA OR

RECLINED FULL LENGTH AGAINST IWO SOILED PILLOWS AS HE RELATED

THE DETAILS OF TROUBLES THAT HAD REDUCED HIM FROM A

"MAN OF

MEANS" TO POVERTY.

IT IS A MATTER OF RECORD THAT FERRIE WAS ARRESTED IN 1961 ON

A MORALS CHARGE IN JEFFERSON PARISH WITH COMMITTING A CRIME

- AGAINST NATURE AND INDECENT BEHAVIOR WITH JUVENILES.

NEW ORLEANS POLICE REPORTED FERRIE HAD AITEMPTED TO INTIMIDATE

ONE WITNESS, A 16 YEAR OLD BOY, WHO TOLD OFFICERS THAT HE SIGNED

A PAPER PROMISING NOT TO PREFER CHARGES AGAINST FERRIE.

OTHER YOUTHS TOLD POLICE FERRIE TOOK THEM ON AIRLINE FLIGHTS

TO HOUSTON AND CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.

ONE BOY TOLD OFFICERS HE HAD FLOWN TO CUBA WITH FERRIE AND

ANOTHER REPORTED TO POLICE THAT FERRIE HAD ASKED HIM TO DRIVE

A CUBAN CITIZEN TO MIAMI.

FERRIE WAS NOT CONVICTED. ALL OF THE CHARGES WERE NOL PROSSED.

• BUT ABOUT THIS IIME FERRIE WAS BUMPED FROM THE PAYROLL OF EASTERN

AIRLINES WHERE HE HAD BEEN A RESPECTED PILOT.

• IN OUR CONVERSATION, FERRIE CONTENDED HE WAS FRAMED BY JEFFERSON

PARISH AUTHORITIES AND, IN FACT, AUTHORITIES TRIED TO SHAKE

: HIM DOWN FOR $5,000 TO DROP THE MATTER.

FERRIE WAS BITTER AT THE WORLD. HE SAID THE COURTS OFFERED

NO JUSTICE, THAI THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENI OFFERED NO PROTECTION IO CITIZENS

FROM TIME TO TIME HE BROKE INTO AN ALMOST NON-STOP NARRATIVE

OF HIS TROUBLES TO LASH OUT AT THE LAW, AT JUSTICE AND IHE NEWS MEDIA.

HIS HEAD COVERED WITH A WIG THAI WAS A RUSTY SHADE OF RED,

HIS SHOES OFF, AND A CIGARETTE OR CUP OF COFFEE CONSTANTLY

IN HIS HAND, FERRIE TALKED ON AND ON.

ONCE HE QUESTIONED THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT ON THE TRAJECTORY

OF THE BULLETS THAT CRASHED INTO KENNEDY'S BODY.

HE DRAGGED BOOKS ON ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY FROM A BACK ROOM

AND LAUNCHED.

INTO A MEDICAL DISSERTATION ON THE ASSASSINATION.

HE SEEMED IO KNOW THE HUMAN BODY LIKE HIS LIVING ROOM. AND

YOU CAUGHT FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE AS HE EXPOUNDED ON HIS THEORIES.

IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE THAT HE HAD BECOME

A PARI-TIME INVESTIGATOR. "FERRIE IS A PILOI," HE IOLD ME,

"BUT IN K COMPLEX CASES INVOLVING SCIENCE

SEVERAL ATTORNEYS

HAVE FOUND IT ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE ME INVESTIGATE FOR IHEM."

HE WORKED FOR TOP ATTORNEYS IN TOWN, SUCH AS G. WRAY GILL,

DEFENSE LAWYER FOR MAFIA CHARACTER CARLOS MARCELLO.

WHAT EVER ELSE HE WAS, FERRIE WAS RESPECIED AS AN INVESIIGAIOR

AND A PILOT. HE WAS CONSIDERED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE AROUND TOWN

AS TOPS AS A FLYER AND AN INSTRUCTOR.

.. FERRIE WOULD HAVE BEEN

49-YEARS-OLD IN MARCH.

THE REASON FOR THE TEXAS TRIP ON THE DAY KENNEDY WAS SHOI,

- SAID FFERRIE, WAS A SPUR OF THE MOMENT THING.

"ONE GUY REMEMBERED THERE WAS AN ICE SKATING RINK IN HOUSTON

SO WE DECIDED TO GO SKATING."

THIS VERSION IS DISPUTED BY ONE OF THE TWO PERSONS WHO WENT

WITH FERRIE. HE SAID THE TRIP WAS PLANNED FOR A WEEK AND NO

HUNTING EQUIPMENT WAS TAKEN WAS FERRIE'S CLAIM.

FERRIE'S MIND DWELLED. ON ARREST. HE SAID SEVERAL TIMES HE WANTED

ME TO ARRANGE A LIE DETECTOR TEST FOR HIM IN CASE HE WAS HAULED

- IN.

ASKED FERRIE IF HE THOUGHT THE GARRISON INVESTIGATION WAS

A PHONY.

"WHY CERTAINLY," HE SAID. "HOW COULD II BE ANYTHING ELSE."

AGAIN, HE SAID, "MY ASSESSMENT OF OSWALD IS SUCH THAT HE WOULD

BE INCAPABLE OF CONSPIRING BECAUSE HE WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF

ANY INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP." ESPECIALLY IN ANY THING AS

DELICATE AS A CONSPIRACY TO KILL. ONLY A NUT WOULD BE A CO-CONSPIRATOR

BECAUSE HE WAS SO ERRATIC."

OF THE INVESTIGATION, FERRIE SAID, "PSYCHOLOGICALLY, I THINK

• ITS AN UTIER WASTE OF TIME."

I UNDERSTAND THAI TONIGHT TELEVISION CARRIED A STORY QUOTARING

_ A DOCTOR WHO TREATED FERRIE AS SAYING IHAT FERRIE HAD BEEN

EXTREMELY SICK THREE WEEKS BEFORE HE CALLED THE PAPER.

- THE DOCTOR SAID FERRIE DECIDED TO CALL ME AT THE NEWSPAPER

• BECAUSE HIS FRIENDS HAD STOPPED CALLING HIM. WHEN HE CALLED

- TO FIND OUT WHY, THEY TOLD HIM THE DA HAD BEEN TALKING TO THEM.

THIS WAS APPARENTLY THE LAST STRAW.

- TV ALSO QUOTES THE DOCTOR AS BEING TOLD BY FERRIE THAI HE WANTED

TO FILE $5 MILLION LAW SUIT AGAINST GARRISON.

- FERRIE TOLD ME THE SUIT WOULD BE AGAINST JACK MARTIN, WHOM

HE SAID STARTED EVERYTHING, AND UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL

FOR SOMETHING THEY HAD CARRIED • I AM VAGUE ON IHIS POINT.

the army was able to confirm only the barest outline of what you &

he enlisted in the Enlisted Army Reserve Corps on the 13th of april, 1950.

he gave his birthdate as march 28, 1918, and was given seriel number

ER 15 296 049. he was on active duty (fort unknown) from august 6

until august 20, and from august 28 until november 25, all in 1950.

(that break apparently was some sort of leave.) he was discharged

sor on april 17, 1953., in new orleans.

sorry it's so skimpy, but arny says that's all it has, since reserve

MEMORANDUM

LANDRY

FERRIE

2'3

March 28, 1967

TO:

FROM:

RE:

JIM GARRISON, DISTRICT ATTORNEY

ANDREW J. SCIAMBRA, ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY

INTERVIEW WITH

AL LANDRY

MARCH 23, 1967

MR. LANDRY was born January 13, 1945, and is now 22

years old.

He stated to me that he first met FERRIE when he was

a member of the Lakefront c.A.P.

He said this was around late

1958 or early '59. He said BATISTA was still in power in Cuba

so he imagines it must have been late 1958. He says he was

fourteen years old when he joined the C.A.P. and lived at 5221

Arts Street.

He said that he first met FERRIE about four months

after he had joined the Lakefront C.A.P.

The C.A.P. use to hold

meetings at the Lakefront on Friday night and Sunday afternoon

on a weekly basis. He said that it was at these meetings that

he met FERRIE. He said that sometime in 1959 after CASTRO had

taken over in Cuba, DAVE FERRIE disappeared for about seven to

nine weeks and the next time he saw him on a Sunday afternoon

was at the C.A.P. meeting when FERRIE came to the meeting

with

AL CHERAMIE in FERRIE's 1953 tan Ford. CHERAMIE was driving the

car as FERRIE could not move around as he was apparently injured.

CHERAMIE got out of the automobile and started moving all FERRIE's

papers and files from the C.A.P. building and began putting them

in FERRIE's automobile. It seems that FERRIE had had some mis-

understanding with COLONEL MORRELI and PAT PRINZis mother and as

these two people sort.of ran the Lakefront C.A.P.. it appeared

that they had asked FERRIE to resign.

FERRIE did resign from the

Lakefront C.A.P. and formed his own C.A.P. group and called them

the Falcons.

He did this about five months after he had resigned

from Lakefront.

This group actually came into existance in late

1959.

It was shortly at this time that LANDRY said he ran away

from home which dated back to early 1960.

LANDRY said that

approximately one year later while FERRIE was living at 331

Atherton Drive, FERRIE told him about the incident that occurred

to him when he had disappeared for about seven to nine weeks.

FERRIE mentioned this after he had had a lively discusion with

LANDRY with regard to his views concerning the Cuban situation

that he and

ARCACHA SMITH and some other Cuban friends would

liberate Cuba

from CASTRO. LANDRY told him that he had no idea

that FERRIE could liberate Cuba and that he questioned his ability

to do so.

FERRIE at this time told him of the incident which had

occurred when he was away from the city for about seven to nine

weeks.

FERRIE said that a couple of weeks prior to the time when

LANDRY had seen him in the car with CHERAMIE at the airport

removing his equipment, he and several other Cubans had been to

Cuba in an effort to help Cubans escape from CASTRO's prison.

FERRIE told him that

during one of these visits to Cuba he ran

in to some trouble and was attacked by a CASTRO soldier and was

stabbed in the stomach. He showed LANDRY a scar across his stomach

approximately ten to fifteen inches long which he said resulted

fron the stab wound.

HH 54756

DodId: 32263970 Page 117

## Page 118

- 2-

FERRIE at this time told him that he was working for

the C.I.A. rescuing Cubans out of CASIRO's prison in cuba..

He

said that he was called down to Miami and stayed there for

approximately one week in a hotel before he was contacted by the

C.I.A. men in Miami.

He said that he attributed the delay in

being contacted to the fact that the C.I.A. wanted to test him to

see if he was the type of person who told his business to any-

body on the street.

He said that a woman from the C.I.A. was

sent to his apartment and tried to get information from him about

his activities with the C.I.A. but that he did not tell her any-

thing and it was after this test that he was actually contacted

by the c.I.A. people in Miami.

He said that shortly thereafter

he and about nine Cubans flew down to a point close to Cuba

and

they then got on rubber rafts and went into Cuba and rescued some

prisoners out of the prison camps. He said it was during this

incident that he was stabbed.

The soldier who stabbed him was

killed by

some of the people in his party and they carried him to

safety with them.

LANDRY says that he can recall that during

his relationship with FERRIE, FERRIE received long distance calls

from Miami and Cleveland, Ohio. FERRIE also told him that ARCACHA

SMITH was the third man in line in the Cuban Hierarchy when Cuba

would be liberated.

The No. 1 man lived in Miami. LANDRY said

that he can recall that at one time the No. 1 man whose name he

can't remember at the moment was supposed to make a trip down

to New. Orleans to see how the Cuban Revolutionary Front was

making out, and the plane he was to come on was highjacked and

taken to Cuba. He said that FERRIE then asked him if he would

like to make a trip down to Miami to pick up the No. 1 man and

fly him down to New Orleans in a private plane.

LANDRY told him

that he would go with him but FERRIE never did mention anything

more to him about this.

LANDRY said that FERRIE often told him

that when Cuba would be liberated from CASTRO, he would be a very

big man in Cuba and hé wanted AL LANDRY to go

and live with him

in Cuba.

He said that they would live like kings because the

people would always look at them as their savior. FERRIE said

that there were three branches working for the liberation of

Cuba, one in Miami, one in New Orleans, and one in Texas.

LANDRY said that after the Bay of Pigs FERRIE became

annoyed with the C.I.A. and often belittled the caliA. and

President Kennedy..

He said the C.I.A. and President Kennedy had

screwed the whole invasionup, and that they had betrayed the

Cuban people by refusing to send the air support that was prom-

ised.

LANDRY said that FERRIE had a blackboard in his apartment

and he often drew own his blackboard the actual plans for the

invasion of Cuba explaining what the Cubans were supposed to do

and

at what point the C.I.A. was supposed to send the air support.

LANDRY said he talked as if he knew all about the battle plans

and the invasion.

FERRIE told him of how the boats got in touch

with the C.I.A. and requested the air support and the C.I.A. had

KENNEDY on the hot line and how KENNEDY was supposed to give the

okay for the air support, but he said that KENNEDY and the C.I.A.

did not intervene like they said they would. The Cubans were

promised by the C.I.A. that when the time was right after some

troops had already gotten on the island they would furnish the

air support.

JIM GARRISON, DISTRICT ATTORNEY

JIM ALCOCK,

EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY

LAWRENCE FOX

3626 Dante Street

New Orleans,: La.

482-7301

On Friday, April 14, 1967, I along with Kent Simms of

our staff interviewed MR. FOX. MR. FOX is presently employed

by Hauser-American Printing Company at 44i Gravier Street in the

city of New Orleans.

LAWRENCE FOX was a C.A.P. cadet from

approximately November 1955, until March 1957. His unit was

located at the New Orleans Airport.

During this time, he does

not recall ever having met LEE HARVEY OSWALD. From March 1957

through December 14, 1959, FOX was a member of the armed services

United States Air Force.

In the latter part of December 1960, he

again joined the Civil Air Patrol as a senior member.

He remained

a member of the C.A.P. until approximately October 1960. During

this time, he was the administrative assistant to DAVID W. FERRIE

who was the commanding officer of the unit.

FOX recalls having

gone to FERRIE's house in Jefferson Parish on a few occasions.

The times that he was at FERRIE's house were usually at a party

given among the C.A.P. members.

As he recalls, some of the members

of the squadron at this time were AL MIESTER, CARL COSTA, and

LAYTON MARTENS

During the summer of 1961 LAWRENCE FOX solicited funds

for the Crusade to Free Cuba.

As a result of this work, he was

introduced by DAVE FERRIE to SERGIO ARCACHA SMITH. Also active

at this time with ARCACHA and FERRIE WaS LAYTON MARTENS.

In

fact, FOX and MARTENS on several occasions went out soliciting

funds together.

On about two occasions, FOX and FERRIE went to

the International Trade Mart to solicit

funds.

However, FOX

does not recall what office they went to in the Trade Mart.

He

does recall that it was necessary for them to take an elevator

to get to the office.

On none of these occasions did FOX meet

CLAY L. SHAW.

However, FOX seems to recall having met CLAY SHAW

briefly in the year 1955.

The occasion for this meeting was the

Inter-American Investment Conference.

LAWRENCE FOX's mother. was

MR. NUTTER's secretary. LAWRENCE believes MR. NUTTER was the

•President of International House at that time.

FOX does not recall having been in FERRIE's Louisiana

Avenue Parkway apartment in the year 1963.

He does not know

PERRY RUSSO, NILS PETERSON, KENNY CARTER OL SANDRA MOFFETT. FOX

recalls that a girl by the name of Carolyn Taylor, a C.A.P. cadet,

did some typing in the summer of 1961 for the Crusade to Free

cuba.

FOX will attempt to locate any .C.A.p.. records he has and

should he find any, will call us and make them available.

INVESTIGATOR LYNN LOISEL

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH AGENT #1

Agent #1 called Lynn Loisel and told him that Dave

Ferrie and he had gone to an apartment off the Veterans Highway

to look at some dirty films last night; that this apartment was

in one of Carlos Marcello's apartment houses and the apartment

was 18N but he didn't know the address. He said there were about

15 people present and he believed that the operator of the show

is a Cuban named "Carlos". Agent #l also stated that there were

3 colored girls whose names were Schwanda, Margaret and Barbara.

He said that Margaret has been with Dave since 1962 and that she

knows plenty of his

associates. Schwanda and Barbara haven't been

around that long, and that Margaret was Dave's favorite. He said

that Dave had asked him (Agent #1) to burglarize this clerk's

house because he felt like he could make some "easy money". He

also said that this clerk always had $1,000 on him and knows he

must keep

the airport Monday, and Dave would get his license plate number,

check it out and find out where the clerk lives, then they would

burglarize the house with Dave acting as the lookout man and

Dave going in.

Agent #1 also said that Ferrie put money in the

N.B.C. bank yesterday. Agent #1 said he doasn't know where Ferrie

gets

the money from because Ferrie only makes living expenses by

teaching student fliers at the airport.

Agent #I said Dave was carrying a rifle in his car

and he said he was going to shoot one of those kids that

burglarized his apartment. Loisel asked him when the apartment

was burglarized and what was taken, and agent #1 said it was

burglarized a few days ago and two reels of dirty film, a letter

and some pictures of Dave screwing the nigger girl Margaret and

a picture of Frank Woodruff in an army camp standing naked jerking

HH 54756

Later on this date Agent #I called me back. (Loisel)

and told me that a Cuban was out talking to Dave a few minutes

ago (approximately 3:00 P.M.) and he was sure that Dave called

the Cuban "Carlos". He said he didn't believe that this was the

same Carlos who had shown the film last night.

Agent #1 also said that Dave Ferrie told him that the

clerk would be at the airport Saturday and that Agent #I was to

burglarize the Clerk's house maybe Saturday night but that he

would go by himself and would burglarize the house when everybody

was sleeping. Loisel asked Agent #1 why Dave decided that he was

not going to go with Agent #1 and Agent #1 said that from here on

out I am going to leave the burglaries to you, that will be your

department. Agent #1 said that he would call back tomorrow to

MEMORANEUM

July 12, 1967

TO:

FROM:

RE:

JIM GARRISON, District. Attorney

ROBERT E. LEE, Assistant District Attorney

DAVID W. FERRIE

DAVID FERRIE was a pilot with Eastern Airlines in 1959.

I was employed with Eastern Airlines while studying at Tulane

in undergraduate school and completing my law studies at Tulane.

During the course of my employment as a flight purser

with Eastern, I had on occasion been a member of the

same flight

crew with DAVID W. FERRIE.

After graduation from Tulane Law School, I continued

to fly with Eastern, mostly at night, and practiced law out of

my office on Veterans Highway in Metairie on a full time basis.

I opened my law office in August of 1960. My second

FERRIE had purchased

some

stock in a close corporation whose headquarters were located in

Honduras. In addition to buying this stock, he had flown down

to Honduras to look into a "Kahunie Nut" venture. Simply it was

this --:

"The Kahunie Nut has a juice which when squeezed out and

mixed with a certain compound will harden into a mass as strong

as iron, and of course, rust proof and will endure

There are only two machines available built to squeeze the juice

from the Kahunie Nut--one is in Chicago and one is in Belize,

Honduras. The owner of the machine in Chicago won't exhibit

sell his

machine since he is preparing to move his equipment to

Honduras to start production.

Incidentally, there is only one

area in the world where the Kahunie Nut grows,

in the jungles of

Honduras.

So that if FERRIE acts fast, he and the corporation

can lease all the land growing Kahunie Nuts. However, the

corporation, l.e:, the president and his wife and FERRIE, have to

buy the only remaining machine--the one hidden in the jungles of

Honduras.

I don't remember the president's name but he knows

where the machine is, but he must give $2,000 to an official of the

Honduran Government and

in return the official, who also knows

where the machine is, will issue an exclusive work permit to

harvest and manufacture "Kahunie Nut Juice."

FERRIE purchased $4,500 of stock and gave the president

of the corporation $2,000 for the machine. Neither FERRIE's

money nor the machine ever got together, and FERRIE came to me.

My last occasion with DAVE FERRIE in my office was

when he told

me that he wanted to adopt a

seventeen year old boy

by the name of CHERAMIE. I advised him that I would charge him

$75.00 and would begin to research and to call me back in a week

or so. About three days later he came to the office extremely

-1-

HY. 54756

DocId: 32263970

Page 125

## Page 126

agitated.

CHERAMIE had joined the Marine Corps and FERRIE

wanted him out and he was prepared to pay any amount. I patiently

explained that the Marine Corps would not discharge except for

medical reasons or moral turpitude.

FERRIE seized on the moral

turpitude and asked me to explain exactly what it meant.

telling him that moral turpitude included homosexual offenses,

he cut me off abruptly and excitedly exclaiming,

that's it, that's

it.

FERRIE told me that he and CHERAMIE had had homosexual

relations.

I told FERRIE that I didn't believe him and further,

that the Marine Corps would insist that a drastic admission such

as this be

in writing.

FERRIE immediately pulled my typewriter to him and typed

three single spaced pages giving dates, etc.

When he was finished,

he triumphantly thrust the document towards me with a smirk on

his face. I read it once, tore it in three pieces and pulled him

to the door and shoved him out.

I told him I didn't want him in

the office again and that he owed me $75.00 for my trouble and

to mail it to my office.

On the few occasions that I was a crew member on

FERRIE'S

flights, he was captain.

We flew to Houston, Corpus

Christie and Brownsville with stops between New Orleans and

Houston, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, New Iberia, Lake Charles,

Beaumont, Port Arthur, thence to Houston, Corpus Christie,

Brownsville and back the same way the same day.

As a rule, the

flight would have

about a thirty minute hangover between stops

for passenger deplaning, baggage, cargo handling, etc.

During

this period of time, the captain would go into the station

manager's operations office and check the weather ahead, fuel

requirements, etc.

The last year I flew off and on as a crew

member with FERRIE was 1962. FERRIE never got out of the cockpit

from the minute we took off from New Orleans at 11:40 A. M.

until we returned at midnight.

Ordinarilly the captain at the

end

of the trip would stop in operations if for nother reason

than to stow his flight bag until his next trip.

went through operations while starting the flight or ending the

trip, the times I was part of his crew.

I casually asked him about this, in Houston once and

he told me that his life was in danger,

that the Communists were

out to get him.

He did, in fact, appear very disturbed on

every occasion.

When I knew him in the beginning he was very

talkative and cheerful.

But when I saw him in 1962, he was grim,

to say the least, and totally unresponsive to his fellow pilots

or crew members.

I think I was the only one he really talked to

and then only because I was an attorney.

I can remember occasions in 1961 and 1962 when FERRIE

would stop by the office unexpectedly usually on saturday

afternoons when my office building was deserted.

On these visits

he began to tell me something of his extracurricular activities

but only after inspecting my office for bugging equipment and

These activities

ISLe Of Pines. He would make these trips via Tampa and one of

the Keys and then on to Cuba. He also mentioned training Cuban

Guerrillas.

In 1961 or 1962 the chief pilot for Eastern in New

Orleans asked me, in my capacity as

an attorney, to check into a

report that FERRIE had stolen an ancient 2,000 year old crucifix

•from a Greek Orthodox Church either in Louisville, Kentucky, or

Knoxville, Tennessee, I'm not sure.

I believe the Jefferson

Parish authorities can give us the necessary information in this

matter. It seems to me that FERRIE and others ransomed this

crucifix.

The figure $20,000 comes to mind.

The last time I saw or heard of DAVID W. FERRIE was in

1962.

Interview of pavid Ferrig)by John Volz at the District Attorney's

office at approximately 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, December 15,

1966

VOLZ:

were you acquainted with Oswald?

FERRIE:

To my knowledge, no. I was told and I believe but I

am not sure, 3 years ago, I believe it was a Mr. Wall from the

FBI who told me I think, I met Oswald.

Something is telling me

at the moment, roughly at the age of 15.

vOLZ:

Oswald was 15?

FERRIE: Right. I have no way of estimating this. This was

told to me third, fourth, fifth-hand. when the assassination

of Kennedy took place a picture of Oswald was supposed to have

been on television

and a young fellow whose name i don't

recollect,

and the only hook I have is that his uncle runs a florist shop

somewhere out on Canal Street, recognized the Oswald face on the

TV presentation.

He then calls one of the stations, WDSU or WWL,

and says that he recognized the face and knew this fellow Oswald.

In the interview, either newspaper or TV, but I am pretty sure

it was public rather than an investigation, he and Oswald had

been in the Civil Air Patrol cadet program

in my unit and of

course this kind of surprised me because I didn't recognize the

name of this lad that identified Oswald's picture.:

This is being

very frank, when I got hit with this thing I started me own in-

vestigation so for a l0-day period it was back and forth between

me and the FBI.

so far as I could develop this florist shop

fellow had gone to school with Oswald and tried to get Oswald

socialized, unsuccessfully, as part of the attempt to get him in

the Civil Air Patrol.': I understand he was in there for only a

matter od ays - two or three weeks.

This young fellow told me

that he had, in fact, in company with other cadets come by my

house.

As near as I could put that together I must have been

living in Kenner.

He said I had met Oswald

How did you get this information?

FERRIE:

some through the FBI and some I developed on my own.

VOLZ:

You have no recollection of Oswald?

FERRIE:

No I don't. This much is of interest. A fellow by the

name of Jack Martin kicks the whole thing off and gets me involved

I don't mind this being in a public record. Martin is a psycho-

path. Martin has a special vendetta for me.

VOLZ: :...

Why?

FERRIE: First, how do you explain a psychopath. However, there

are specific grounds. I. used to work for G. Wray Gill. Martin

fancies himself as an investigator. He acquainted himself with

me and tried to get some of Gill's work. Gill would not have him

because as Gill says, Martin plays both sides of the street. One

day I threw Martin out of the office. Not bodily, but I ordered

him out. Remember the time of the first Marcello case in

Actuat

Gill is the New Orleans lawyer for Marcello. Martin told Klein

that I had taught Oswald how to shoot a rifle. which is interest-

ing, since I am not such a good shot myself. In any event, that

year, the year of the assassination, I am uncertain but my belief

is that Oswald was here in the City of New Orleans:

VOLZ:

How do you know that?

FERRIE:

I am trying to remember...newspaper stories. klein

questioned me about this.

To my knowledge and belief I haven't

met Oswald.. I was busy working for Gill at that time.

VOLZ:

Do you know Morris Brownlee? In what connection?

FERRIE:

I have known Morris for 10 or 12 years. He has been in

a lot of trouble during that time:

VOLZ:

Did you take a trip on November 22, 1963?

FERRIE:

Whatever the day that the verdict was

rendered in the

Marcello

case I took a weekend vacation.

VOLZ:

Where did you go?

FERRIE:

Houston, Galveston and Vinton. I had some business

industristi

Gill to take care of.

VOLZ:

• What business was this with Gill?

FERRIE: One of his cases in Federal Court.

Marion James Johnson

was on appeal. I forgot whether I was to ask him for money for a

transcript or what.

VOLZ:

Where did you go first?

FERRIE:

VOLZ:

Houston.

What did you do in Houston?

FERRIE:

VOLZ:

We went ice-skating.

Who went with you?

FERRIE: Alvin Beauboef and Melvin Coffey. He is

a rocket engineer

at one of the electronic places:

VOLZ:

You say you went ice-skating in Houston. Do you know

what rink?

FERRIE:

To my knowledge it was the only one in this area.

Used

to be one in Baton Rouge. I am a yankee and I like to ice-skate

and that whole time during the trial it was pretty much a ?-day

a week thing.

VOLZ: .

Do you recall when you went ice-skating?

FERRIE:

When the verdict came in, as I recall we had to go back

to the office at Noon. If I could recall the house the President

was shot. It was at that time we heard the President was shot.

In the next two or three hours thereafter the verdict came in.

Then we went to the Royal: Orleans Hotel and we had a victory

party or whatever you call it. This thing must have gone on until

supper time.

tricky thing. wall would know.

we wanted to go ice-skating and then hunting. We

were going to hunt geese south of Beaumont in that area to be

more specific. It seems to me we got to Houston. How long does

it take to get to Houston?

VOLZ: .

About 8 hours I think: Did you ever fly to Houston?

FERRIE: I fly extensively.

I was. in Houston three times over

the past week. I guess we got there about midnight.

VOLZ:

Had you planned this trip?

FERRIE: We made up our minds when the Morcello trial was over

we were going to take a vacation.

VOLZ:

During or after the trial?

FERRIE: Even before the Marcello case we worked for G. Wray

Gill any hour or any day and that usually was most days and most

hours. He leads you a wild chase.

VOLZ:

There had been a contemplated trip for sometime.

You

were going hunting but you didn't know exactly where you were

heading

for?

FERRIE:

And couldn't have cared less.

VOLZ:

Whose car?

FERRIE:

Mine.

VOLZ:

What kind of car?

FERRIE:

60. or 61 Comet wagôn.

At the time that we left we had

no idea where we were going.

VOLZ:

You were going hunting? Did you take any weapons?

FERRIE:

Yes.

VOLZ:

What kind?

FERRIE:

Shotguns.

VOLZ:

How many?

FERRIE:

I assume offhand a weapon apiece.

You went to Houston and went skating. Do you recall

FERRIE: We left at night. Stayed in a motel.: Have to go back

skating. I was the only one that knew

how.

Did you rent skates or have your own?

We rented them. I don't think I had my own skates.

vOLZ:

How long did you stay in Houston?

FERRIE:

My recollection of the moment is we stayed there that

next night. The day we ice-skated.

'VOLZ:

That would be November 23.

FERRIE: Whether we stayed in Houston the night of the 23rd I

don't know.

something tells me we went to Galveston. We were

looking for some

evening activity.

VOLZ:

What do you mean? Night life?

FERRIE: You can call it night life.

VOLZ:

looking for ladies?

FERRIE:

We went down to Galveston, we found that the town was

dead.

VOLZ:

Did you leave for Galveston in the morning or night?

Do you know what you did when you got to Galveston? Besides

finding it dead?

FERRIE:

I remember the morning in Galveston because we went

out looking for bars and found out the only ting you could buy

was beer. By our standards here it was dead.

It couldn't get

deader. So far the vacation had been falling on its head. It

seems to me it was inclement, some inclemency in the weather.

Coolness.

I don't know what we expected for November, but we

wanted something pleasant. I am trying to recall whether I

stopped at vinton on the way to Houston of coming back. I think

I may have my dates all mixed up here. I think we stayed in

Vinton that night.

VOLZ:

The night of the 22nd?

FERRIE:

The night of whatever date we left here.

We went to

Marion James Johnson's roadhouse - a combination restaurant, bar

etc.

VOLZ:

That was in Vinton?

FERRIE:

Yes.

VOLZ:

What made you decide to go to Vinton?

FERRIE:

sooner of later I was going to have to go there for

Gill. This was two birds with one stone:

VOLZ:

What did you do in Vinton?

FERRIE:

Talked to Marion James Johnson.

VOLZ:

The night of the 22nd?

FERRIE: Yes, I think so. Once again, if I could get the record

I could tell you so. Don't forget this was three

years ago.

VOLZ:

Then you went to Houston after Vinton?

FERRIE:

I am recollecting it that way right now. The reasons

I am saying that is this.

When we left Galveston we decided

to go look for the geese. I remembered I boarded

a ferry across

a channel down along the south shore. We did, in fact, get to

where the geese were and there were thousands, but you couldn't

approach them. They were a wise bunch of birds.

VOLZ:

Did you kill any geese?

FERRIE:

No.

VOLZ:

Was that early in the morning?

FERRIE:

Daylight but not early morning.

VOLZ:

That would be about the 24th. You went to Vinton,

Houston, Galveston.

FERRIE: I say it is all right in the absence of anything else.

VOLZ:

After Galveston then what?

FERRIE:

We decided to go to Alexandria, La. where Beauboef

had some relatives. Then we got the idea of staying there for

2 or 3 days. I decided to call Gill and tell him we were not

coming back for a couple of days. Gill told me you had better

get back here, we are in major trouble. Jack Martin told Klein

that I knew Lee Harvey Oswald and had conspired with Oswald in

the

assassination of Kennedy. I cam back and don't recall which

day it was. Sat in this very office..

I was pretty much surrounded

by investigators and everybody. Klein asked me pretty much the

questions that you are asking me now. They showd me 4 or 5 police

photos of people and asked if I could identify them and I couldnt.

one was supposed to be Lee Harvey Oswald for an arrest for dis-

turbing the peace here in New Orleans.

Klein decided that I did

know Lee Harvey Oswald and arrested me as a fugitive from Texas

and they took me over to the First District. I stayed there foz

a couple of days while all of this was checked out.

VOLZ:

How long did you stay in Alexandria?

FERRIE:

I don't think a full day. I don't recall staying over-

night and somewhere along the line we thought we had better check

in and that's when Gill told me to come back at once.

VOLZ:

How did you arrange for gasoline?

FERRIE:

I don't recall.

VOLZ:

Do you have a credit card?

FERRIE:

NO.

VOLZ:

None at all?

FERRIE:

NO.

VOLZ:

was the trip uneventful? Did you have any difficulties?

FERRIE:

Not that I can recall. The events that stay in my mind

are ice-skating, deadness in Galveston, geese and the phone call

to Gill..

VOLZ:

Did you do any hunting in Alexandria?

FERRIE:

I don't believe we dia. Again, I would have to go back

to something else to refresh my memory:

vOL'Z:

Did you meet any friends.

Do you have any acquaintances

in any of those towns?

FERRIE:

I Know Marion James Johnson, a business acquaintance.

No one in Houston or Galveston.

voLZ:

How about Alexandria.

FERRIE: These would be Beauboef's relatives.

VOLZ:

Did you all 3 come back together?

FERRIE:

Just the 3 of us, Beauboef, Coffey and myself.

VOLZ:

Around that particular time in that area, what was

Morris Brownlee doing?

FERRIE: I don't even know right now.

VOLZ:

He was just a friend of yours or was he in your unit?

FERRIE: I don't think he ever joined Civil Air Patrol. This is

going back 12 or 13 years:

VOLZ: Around that particular time, di you ever go hunting with

Morris? Does Morris ever go hunting?

FERRIE:

I would imagine so. I don't know if he ever went hunting

with me. I don't know. This isn't the kind of thing you remember.

VOLZ:

Did you ever take any trips with Morris?

FERRIE:

res, I think so. But I am not sure about this. I would

have to ask Gill. Somewhere back in 61 or 62 I had to go to

Mississippi for Gill on an oil bill. I believe I took Brownlee

with me because at that time he was doing

a little work for Gill.

I believe that on one of the many trips we took to Vinton because

we were back and forth quite a number of times. I believe he was

on one of those.

Morris went along when Alice Gedeau (? sp),

Gill's

secretary, and I went down to one of the small towns, New

Iberia or somewhere.

There was a murder case where a defendant

had to be interviewed.

VOLZ:

That was 61-52

FERRIE:

Could have been 63.

VOLZ:

Do you recall where you stayed in Galveston?

FERRIE:

NO:

VOLZ:

Do you recall where you stayed in Alexandria?

FERRIE:

No. My only source would be the FBI:

VOLZ:

You are positive that all three of you came back

together?

FERRIE:

That is my recollection.

The only way I would know for

sure would be to call Mr. Wall or the individual.

VOLZ:

But you are positive it was just the 3

of you that went

and came back? Have you ever gone to Dallas?

FERRIE:

Yes, I was in Dallas in March or April of this year.

VOLZ:

How about around that time you went to Houston?

FERRIE: Thank God, no.

As Gill said, if I had been in Dallas,

I would have been in jail.

VOLZ:

Since it came up earlier, you said you were supposed

to have taught Oswald how to shoot a rifle. Have you ever

taught anybody how to shoot a rifle.

FERRIE:

Yes. This was in the Civil Air Patrol cadet program.

Teach them how to shoot a .22 and sometimes something heavier.

It is part of the program.

VOLZ:

Did you teach any of these boys who were on the trip

with you how to shoot.

FERRIE:

Coffey, I don't know.

Beauboef was. a born hunter.

VOLZ:

How about Brownlee?

FERRIE:

He likes the outdoors but whether he goes hunting I

don't know. He is the type that would collect botanical specimens.

or if he did hunt he would use a bow and arrow instead of shooting.

VOLZ:

You say Morris wasn't interested in guns.

FERRIE:

I don't know one way or the other. Morris always

thing.

At this moment my recollection of Morris is that his

interests would be physics, rocketry, electronics and philosophy.

VOLZ:

Was he ever on these cadet training encampments that

you were talking about.

FERRIE:

I don't recall one way or the other.

If you are

interested in completing this thing I will try to remember and

write this down for you.

VOLZ:

What are you doing now?

FERRIE:

Flying.

VOLZ:

For anybody in particular?

FERRIE:

Flying for myself. Flight instructions. One of your.

former associates is one of my customers. Jerry Aurillio.

I feel reasonably confident that the FBI agents who worked on

this would cooperate and I could get other names, the times

and everything else because at that time we had to work out a

rather

fabulous time schedule. They worked out. Oswald's and

mine, too. Then I could give you more definite answers.

VOLZ:

The two boys that you went to texas with, were they

in your unit at the time.

FERRIE: I was not in Civil Air Patrol at that time.

VOLZ:

Do you know if they knew Morris?

FERRIE: Yes, I think so. In what connection and to what

depth I am not sure.

VOLZ:

What was Coffey's first name?

FERRIE:

Melvin. He worked at Michoud.

VOLZ:

When was the last time you saw Coffey or Beauboef?

FERRIE:

I see Beauboef routinely but Coffey not for a long time.

He was upset about this because of his job.

VOLZ:

Who does Beauboef fly for?

FERRIE::: He is not employed as a pilot. He is looking for that

kind of employment.

VOLZ:

Do you know what he is doing now?

VOLZ:

Do you make a decent living with this flying?

FERRIE:

I make a living, I don't know how decent it is.

VOLZ:

Do you do any charter flying?

FERRIE:

Occasionally.

VOLZ:

Have you done any charter flying in the 60's?

FERRIE: In the first part of 1961... Up until August, '61 it was

all air carrier.

VOLZ:

For an airlines?

FERRIE:

Eastern.

VOLZ:

During that time in your spare time did you do any

flying?

FERRIE:

Civil Air Patrol, instructions on the side.

VOLZ:

Did you do any charter work?

FERRIE: It is prohibited. Martin had me going to Cuba. It

was in the newspapers... in a 110 mile an hour airplane with

four hours of gas:

VOLZ:

were you doing any charter flying at the time when he

accused you of this?

FERRIE:. No. I was supposed to be working for the airline. I

was also supposed to have gone in 1963.

Klein asked if that

summer I had been in Cuba. That was some more of Jack Martin.

Is Pershing Gervais still around?

VOLZ:

No, he is hot in our office anymore. Do you want to

see him?

FERRIE:

Not especially. I just wanted to refer you back to

him as to why I am in here this morning. I am thinking about

Martin's personality.

Martin somehow gets to be near the bride

at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.

He somehow

gets involved in civil and criminal affairs. Martin gets

in on

all these interesting little things. He tried to get Pershing

Gervais on brutality. There was a big mess for a few days.

the Warren Report and I think Jack Martin would have seized on

this because this

is exactly his type of meat. I imagine he

would come to someone like Frank Klein, Pershing Gervais or

Jim Garrison and sometimes Martin convinces himself on his con-

fections, sometimes he doesn't. I know he was in the psycho

ward in Charity for a while and was in the psycho ward in Texas.

He used to run a diploma mill in Texas.

VOLZ:

You feel he is responsible for your being here today?

FERRIE:

Yes, I feel it is a possibility.

VOLZ:

Have you read any of these articles?

FERRIE:

No, I am too busy trying to earn a living. I do know

I have seen statements regarding Governor Connelly, I have got

nothing to hide.. But I have been trying to figure

out for the

last two days what I was being subpoenaed for and I tried calling

everybody to find out what it was all about. I tried Gill, he

didn't know anything. The reason I am on this Martin thing is

that Gill tells me 3 or 4 days back Martin called him and wanted

to know where I was, where I was working and how I could be reachea.

Gill and I speculated over various possibilities and this Kennedy

thing was one of them.

VOLZ:

Would you be willing to submit to a polygraph?

FERRIE:

Certainly, I would be willing to submit to truth serum.

FERRIE

TO :

FROM:

RE:

JIM GARRISON

SGT. T. DUFFY AND DET. C. NAVARRE

INTERVIEW OF MIKE FINNEY, RESIDING AT 1418 BEHRMAN,

ALGIERS, LOUISIANA, TELEPHONE 361-5857 ON MARCH 6, 1967.

Mr. FINNEY was interviewed in regard to his connection

with the Civil Air Patrol.

MI. FINNEY stated that he joined the

CAP in 1958 and was in the New Orleans Airport Squadron.

This

was the first time he had met DAVE FERRIE. He was also in the

original Falcon Squadron that DAVE FERRIE had formed.

There

were originally about ten men in this outfit.

He stated that he

remained in the Falcon Squadron until about 1961, when he found

out that this was not a valid branch of the CAP.

Mr. FINNEY

stated that while he was connected with the CAP he had never

met OSWALD or had never heard his name mentioned.

He

also stated

that a Mr. LARRY ATKINSON was a friend of DAVE FERRIE'S at

this time.

He also stated that a MI.. AL CHERAMIE was in the

New Orleans Squadron and that he was a very close friend of

DAVE FERRIE'S. It is his recollection that AL CHERAMIE joined

the Marine Corp in the summer of 1962,

He also stated that he knew a JOHNNY JOHNSON who was

member of the squadron at that time and that JOHNSON as "far

knows is a student at Tulane University at this time.

He stated

that JOHNSON lives somewhere either in Algiers or Gretna. He

may live on Newton Street.

FINNEY stated that a MAJOR MORRELL was the head of the

CAP, New Orleans Squadron, and that he was also a very good

friend of FERRIE'S.

He also stated that JOHNNY JOHNSON'S

mother had told him that FERRIE helped MORRELL a number of times

with many problems. At this time MORRELL was a shoe salesman in

New Orleans and it is his understanding that MORRELL left

New Orleans and is staying somewhere in Texas.

He stated that on occasions when he was in the CAP

he

stayed overnight at DAVE FERRIE'S house. JOHNNY JOHNSON

and AL CHERAMIE also stayed at DAVE FERRIE'S: house overnight.

He stated that a BOB BOYLSTON was a Cadet Commander in the CAP,

and he was also a very good friend of FERRIE'S, as were JOHN

IRION AND AL LANDRY.

It is MI. FINNEY'S understanding that DAVE FERRIE

had a disagreement with MAJOR MORRELL and at this time FERRIE

broke away from the New Orleans Squadron and formed the Falcon

Squadron.

While in this office, FINNEY was shown pictures of

OSWALD, CLAY SHAW, GUY BANISTER, and several others, and he coula

identify only DAVE FERRIE:

Re: David William Ferrie

Dear Mr. Bell:

In response to your request of November 7, 1962,

I have

ascertained the status of the cases pending

against David William Ferrie.

In case No. 171-957,

Section "H", Ferrie is charged

with public intimidation of a State witness in a

case pending against Ferrie..

In that case Ferrie

was arraigned on September 26, 1961. HOwever 1952.

case was never sent to trial.

On November 5,

the complaining witness made an affidavit requesting

that the

charges be dismissed.

This office has not

that Ferrie never

made the scene, as it were.

It seems

that Hyde,

ried to take this Church (Old Roman Catholic) over

but it failed.

According to the American year book of Churches and

It seems after my alert to him (Starkey), he sent in

The main instigators

seem to have been Ferrie, who once

offered Starley $1, 000.00 if he'a ordain him (Ferrie),

Hyde, and this nigger, Marchenna.

Now grape-vine has it that Bishop Eyde, who has valid

A. At this time I feel thai 1t would be against

Captain Ferrie's best interests to reveal the sources of my

A. Yes, I have.

a. Would you outline or describa that so-called

standard of conduct?

A. That 1s very difficult to do, No where can I find

that Easter has ever established a standard of conduct. There

are no publications

provisions to show It. However, if you consider wat Easter

seems to condone in its personnel, then such a standard might

be inferred.

30 October 1961

Captain. G.E. Greiner,

Manager - Operations,

Hastern Air

Lines, Inco,

Moisant Airport,

New Orlans, Ia.

Dear Captain Greiner:

This letter is written in response to your letter, addressed

to me, dated October 19. My attorney, Mr. Graffagnino, has not informed me of

your request for a written report in addition to the verbal information given

during the discussion between Mr. Graffagnino, Senor Arcacha, yourself, and me.

You require: "a plausible explanation of the incidents

that lead to the filing of serious criminal chargés"

against me.

no idea of what you consider

"plausible" there is no way

letter prior to its being forwarded. I will submit the facts as they are. We

have in hand indisputable proof for

the facts cited herein.

For the composition of this letter, reports of reputable

dedectives have been employed. Since your

letter inters you require a chrono-

logical sequence; I shall list these events chronologically.

I must add one caution, however. The very nature of some

of the information contained herein has given me

considerable pause in whether

I should respond to your request for information. First of all,I know of no

"crime", violation of working agrement, or company rule which is violated

when one individual makes a charge against another. Proven charges are

another

thing. It is my opinion that it is not the business

Of Fastern Air Lines

that someone should make charges against me. It is another thing if these

charges are proven to be true

in a court of law. In the second place, the

revelation of this information to you contains a serious potential threat to

my safety, as a subsequent paragraph will reveal. I shall,

therefore, hold you

personally responsible if sone of this information is divulged since my

personal safety is involved.

It is my belief that the chronology begins in 1959.

During the Sumner of 1959 I received my first anonymous, threatening telephone

call. At this time positive information had come into my hands. that Fidel Castro

was a Communist, and that this was known in the State Department prior to

the action of the U.S. Guverrment forcing Bastista out of office. Also at

this time I was laboring to prevent the admission in the U.S. Air Force

Academy of a candidate whose views, as well as those of his family, were

anti-American, since he indicated he had no intention of supporting Amendment

XIV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. From that date until the prescat

(at 2:15 P.M. this date) these delphone calls have continued.

In some of the se telephone

calls I have been

addressed obscenely,

on some occasions as a "Nigger-Lover"

"Radical", a " Cormunist", an

"Atheist",

a "Religious Fanatio" and 80 on. On other occasions polites, well-nodulated voices

bave try to dissuade me from my activities and in particular my

speeches against

those persons and forces I deem subversive. Though all of these

telephone calls.

have been anonymous, the identity of one of the voices has been established.

On other occasions I

reccive "silent" tadephone calls, that is, when we ansver

a call, no response is made by the caller wha, after a short interval, hange up,

or otherwise breaks the connection.

It became apparent that acting as a lone individual I could accomplish

little, whereas with affiliation with a similar-minded

group I might accomplish

much more. Thercfore, I pursued several related problems:

(1) why did certain top officials deliberately cause

the April 17 invasion of Cuba to fail?

(2) who is permitting millions of pieces of Comunist

literature to pass thru the New. Orleans Post Office,:

at government expense, the purpose

which litcrature

is prejudicial to the

United States?

(3) who is permitting proscribed trade with cuba to con-

tinue, which aalso involves a further drain on gold

IESErVES?

(4) why

certain Communists, who enjoy high-level positions

in local government, permitted to continue

their activities

against the United States?

(5) why

are certain koow Communists allowed to continue

dictating the placing of subversive textbooks in public

and private schools?

(6) Why are certain persons in sensitive jobe, for example

scheculed airlines, permitted to contirue subversive

activities?

In a less generalized arca, I have been concerned with the problem:

of Communist

Cuba, and the ramifications. I have been assisting in bringing

Cuban refugees to the United States, and in obtaining necessities including

medical care for them. I have

likewisein activities approved. of and encouraged

by the President of the United States andh hid attorney Cencral - helping to

raise arms for the liberation of Cuba-such is both the right and duty of every

Americani, not to be gainsaid by anyone.

In the intensification of these Anti-Communist activities more talks

have been given than herctofore, radio and I.V. shows, and propaganda disseminated.

Greater efforts have been expended to collect necessary funds to raise arms.

In the course of this I was threatened with a lawsuit by a New Orleans attorney.

This suit was dropped when he learned the nature of the proofs of his subversive

activities.

During the mouth of August three persons associated with this work

were arrested by a particular

New Crleans policenan.. We have been unable to

learn what they vere charged with. They were held incormunicado for four days.

During this time they were also malticated. Their arrest and detention was

illegal not only from: the point of view of State Law but alao Federal Lav.

In the course of the interrogations one police

official tried tod extract a

cormittment from these individuals that they would desist in their activities

to. assist the Cubans. One of the

orpicers stated that his

put Arcacha and ferrie in jail". In pursuance of this objcctive these three

were interrogated to produce evidence against me of

(1) stealing

an airplane;

participating in acts treasonous to the United States;

dealing in contraband;

committing forgery;

illegally dealing in arms.

Subsequent to this the Now Orleans Police

came to. my home to search it,

claiming they possessed a valid Search larrant. They refused to produce this

warrant and refused to divulge the quest of the search. These acts are in

clear violation of the law. They returned a second

time, and did not even

claim to posacas a verrant, but atated they vare searching for rareotice.

They returned a third time

day-long harassment of my mother, my guests and mysclf.

During this same interval I was taken to the Fast Bank Jail, Jefferson

Parish, and interrogated relative to harboring a run away New Orleans juvenile.

arrested for

"crime against nature", allegedly committed with a New Or leans

minor.. I was held incommunicado until a friendly bondsman laarned of my

out and summoned Mr. Grarfagnino, whom I had not known prior

this time. At the time of the arrest the police refused to divulge the charge.

When I finally learned of the chaige and the person allegedly making it

I took two witnesses and confronted the said

New Orleans minor. He admitted

that he made the charges. But, he insisted to myself and witnesses that he

had been compelled to sign these charges or face a jail term. Thereafter, he

signed a statement exonerating me, and indicating how he came to sign them.

The following day he came, of his own volition, and signed a second statement.

The New Orleans authorities vere apprised of this.

The reupon onc

of these same policemen returned to the New Orleans juvenile

and compelled him to sign a second statement stating that he had been

"intimidated"

by meg. and these

samepolice claimed to be able to "produce eight witntasce to

the intimidation". The New Orleans minor has now apparently

disappeared, since

the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's office has beep unable to locate him.

During this time it was learned that my telephone was tapped. The telephone

company and the goverment was notified.. The

tap wire was found, but it had been

out so that the source of the receiving apparatus could not be ascertained..

Recently a second tap occured..

On: October 24, my brother, who

lives and works in the North, had

to him. One of the officials of his company summoned him,

and threatened his job unless it could be ascertained that our family had

further connection with any activity involving

the liberation of Cuba, or

other activitics resisting Communist take-over

in the Caribbean arca.

Iwo other events occured which will not be discussed here, at this time.

All of the foregoing has been climaxed by an extortion attempt, the

revelation of which is dangerous to my safety. I have been told that levcrything

will be forgotten" it

(1) I pay over a substantial sum. of money;

(2) leave the

State of Louisiana;

(3) keep this "offer" a strict secret "or else"

For obvious reasons this cannot be reported to local police,

WILL NOT be reported. However, it has been reported to Federal authorities

for whatever action. they can take.

At this time we do not know the chain-of-command of the Communists

at the local level. However, my problem has been traced with certainty to

a highly placed local official. We have positive evidence that this of icial

Is a Communist and has been in charge of some highly important Communistic

activities involving the protection of Connunists

in the

arca. hother

Comnunists within Eastern Air Lines are involved is not known at this time.

There are several points about which our curiosity is decpening.

We are wondering about the legality of my suspension from flying. We are

curious about your statement (to Mr. Graffagnino, Senor Arcacha and myself)

that someone in authority over you

has indicated that my activities regarding

Cuba be stopped. "

are curious about your implication that Fastern has piled

un other things against me.. (I understand from ALPA that

it is an Eastern

practice to try to accumulate a file to be used against an individual as

it suits the company.) Likewise, we are wondering whether the public interest

would be better served if we released names of Communists and Fellow-Travelers

employed by Eastern Air Lines.

Beyond yourself,. no one knows of the composition of this letter,

including Mr. Grafagnino. I have prepared only a file copy which is secured

in a strong box with certain other pertinent documents. As indicated ir

paragraph

+, page 1, I shall hold you personally responsible if information

is relcased by you to my harm. In particular I am refering to paragraph 3 of

this page.

Be assured that civil suits are

(and possibly more will

be prepared) against any and every individual, organization and/ or group

responsible in any way for any damages that have occured to me during this

affair.

RE:

DAVID. W. FERRIE

aka DI. David Francescas Ferrie

July 30, 31 & August 2, 1963

Bishop George A. Hyde was located at 1657 Park Road, NW,

Washington, D.C. where he advised he has lived for the

past three or four months. He stated there is no parish

of the Orthodox Catholic Church in the District of Colum-

bis and that he serves the Washington, southern Maryland

and northern Virginia area.

He advised his prosent address serves as a study house and

a placo of abode for his postulants and novitiates. Ho

presently has three young men at this address, expocts

one more on August 3, 1963, another on August 15, 1963,

and a total of six or seven for the 1963 fall torn. Each

person holds an outside job and turns all of this money

over to a common fund to run the house. Roligious studies

aro usually conducted in the evening and he has one member

he hopes to enroll in the Anorican University for the 1963

fall term.

Bishop flyde admits he had not registered in the District

of Columbia and he 1s not logally empowered to perform

marriagos but statod he doos not consider it to be neces-

sary in as much as he does not have a parish. When queried

as to conducting funerals, he stated he has conducted

funerals and some marriagos in the New York State area.

However, whon asked as to the last funeral he conducted, ho

was very ovasive as to where and when and finally said

ho had conducted a funeral for one of the members of his

study who had diod in mid-July.

When queried as to where

this funoral and interment took place, he stated he did

not desire, nor would he furnish any information con-

corning the operation of his "community". He did say the

one who was burled was "Brother Lako".

Bishop Hyde advisod he has never mot David Ferrio in par

son. His first contact with Ferrie occurred within the

past two yoars; probably about one and one half yoars ago.

On this occasion, Ferrie was in New Orleans and had been

requestod to contact the Bishop by & person who was very

111 and in a hospital. Hyde was not sure 1f this contact

was by telephone or letter. He stated, following this

initial contact, he has had frequent correspondence with

Ferrie; both by mail and telophone. Approximately gir

months ago, alter considorablo discussion along religious

linos, Farrio asked the Bishop to ordain him. Hydo olaims

he told ferrio that, sinco ho had not not him in person

and had not been able to study him at first hand. he could

not in full justico, accode to this request. Hyde states

that ho told Farrio that 11 ho would come to Washington

and ontor the study, first for sir months as a postulant

and thon for a year as a novitiate, he would consider

ordaining him. Hydo advised that ferrio could not accodo

to these regairements for his financial situation would

not allow 1t. Thoir correspondence, telophonically and

by lotter continuod. Ferrie, in early summer of 1963

again mado his request to be ordained. Hyde statod ha

told Forrio to send hin a list of his educational attain

ments and he would forward them to the Arch-Bishop at

NH 54756

DooId:32263970

Kankakoe, Illinois, and let the activity continue from

there. When queried as to the form in which the attain-

mants were received, (1o, transcripts or resunes) Hyde

was evasive. At this point he, apparently in a moment

of laxity, called Subject "DI. Ferrlo". When asked as

to tho basis of the Doctorate and in what flold, Hydo

statod ho was not sure of the basis but believed that

It my be an honorary degree. He finally admitted that

most likoly ho had roceived & resune from David Ferrie

and no transcripts. Hyde states ho made a cursory por

usal of those items and forwarded then to Bishop Narchenna

1n Kankakeo, Ill1no18.

Hyde claims that Bishop Marchenna visited him st Wash-

Ington, D.C. in tho early part of July 1963. At that

time, Hydo endeavored to convince larchenna, in the good

interests of the church, that he felt, before anyone was

ordained into the church, they should bo given an aran-

ination Into the canon law of the church by all of the

bishops in the church; since one bishop might ordain a

person not really suitable to cloth and would thus be-

come a miafit and a detriment to the church if thay were

to go to sone other aros. Hyde state he had told Fortio

that he folt this would bo to Ferrio's best interest in

the caso of his requesting to bo ordained. Hydo claims

Marchonna seemod to bogin to accout the idea. Hyde

stated ho 1s awaro that Ferrio was not ordained July 19.

1962 and that he had advised Ferrie not to go to Kankakoo.

[at this point, in order to more properly evaluate the

comments of Hydo, it is necessary to set out information

obtained from lydo concerning one, Jack Martial.

During the course of the interview with lydo, he was asked

how the name of Jack Martin was asgociatod with ho and

Forrio. lydo statod ho believed that ho had first come

into contact with Jack Martin some years ago in New York;

city not naned. He describes Martin as an outright

"rounder", living by fraud, blackmall and other devious

means. Hartin loarned that Hyde nosdod a seal and pro-

vidod him with ono. Later ho gave a painting a8 s gift.

knows, associated with Ferrio. Thore 1s sone Indication

Forrie also spent some timo in Louisville. Ferrie began

to question the church authority of Martin and Martin thon

advised the head of the church at Louisville. Supposedly.

Ferrie was road out of the church and vicious comments nade

about him which are attributable to Martin. Hyde claims

that Martin has mado allogations as to hono-sexuality

concorning various officials of the church, Including

himself. Martin, reportodly, has written lotters to

various persons alleging misdeeds of Hyde, Including tho

molesting of children, claiming ho had proof becauso of

publicity in Hashington nowspapers.

Hyde states that kartin 1s the kind of person who will

will answer with a lettor acknowledging the commont and

that Hartin will then uso the lottor to indicato ho is a

friond of Cardinal Cushing. In this way he obtalas

ontry into groups that ho would not otherwise have accoss

to. Hyde has advised that he has mado a notification to

tho Post Offico Department concerning the activities of

Martin and has rocoived & lottor of acknowlodgement from

a postal inspector advising he has "opened" & case on the

matter. Hyde furthor advised ho is making a compilation

Daring tho Interview Hyde was asked to reflect further

on the circunstances undor which he first came into con-

tast with ferrie. After some reflection, Hyde, rather

hesitantly, stated it could be that Jack Martin, through

being over wrought, had suffered a coronary attack and

was hospitalizod in New Orleans. At this point Hyde

commented that Martin noeded nore than a regular MD to

look after him; he needed someone who had gone further

in the medioal profossion. When pinned down on this con-

ment, Hyde stated he bolleved Martin needed paychiatric

treatment. When questioned as to his reason for naking

such a comment. Hyde stated he understood Martin had

Mr. Malcolm Mcintyre,

President,

Eastern Air Lines Inc.,

New York, N.Y.

Dear

SIr:

The writer has been a private investigator for a number of

years and during that time has been acquainted with many investigative.

agencies, their personel, technique, and integrity or lack of 1t. His

experience with

Eastern Air Lines 1s not so extensive. A recent

perience is causing him concern and anger.

I was recently contacted by an individual who represented

himself to be an employee of Southern Research, and employee of

Eastern Air Lines.

The contact was relative to an Investigation of

one Captain David

W. Ferrie.

I have known Captain Ferrie for some time and used his

services In solving a thorny case in which the Federal Government

was Interested. Thus I can vouch for the man and his integrity.

The Individual who contacted me used threats and Intimidation

(all In violation of Louisiana statutes) to get me to cooperate In

framing" Captain Ferrie. When I would not yield blandishments were

offered in the form of a

bribe to assisting in "hanging" this man.

THis strikes me as detestible.

when I would not cooperate with these people, I was subjected

co harassment, my house placed under surveillance, neighbors contacted,

and in general my peace and quiet disturbed.

Is this the way Eastern Air Lines operates? Is 1t part of

your policy to harass the general public so that something can be

framed against one oi your own employees? I hardly think that a man

of your integrity and position would tolerate such conduct.

I read in the newspapers where 13 of your Captain exposed

their ships and their passengers to unnecessary hazard by having

stewardesses on their laps while in flight.

were slapped

and they went back to work. Contrariwise, this man who has worked

hard and honorably for Eastern 1s being

subjected to a campaign

to get him fired. Illegal and unethical activities are being employed.

I trust that a man in your position will not permit this

without further delay. Meanwhile, I am compelled to advise my

associates and subordinates not to patronize Eastern Air Lnes until

this situation Is cleared up.

I hope to have your early reply.

Yours truly,

Dear It. Leonard,

In accordance with our conversation oftoday, I am

herewith submitting the following questions:

50

I. Why did the New Orleans Police Department arrest

David (Dave) Ferrie in November, 1963, in connection

with anninvestigation of Lee Harvey Oswald?

2. Was there any indication that Mr. Ferrie had any

connections with Oswald during 1963 or during the 1950's.

when Oswald was a student in junior high school and high

school in New Orleans?

3. Why did Lt. Paul Dwyer, and Sgt. Frederick S. P. O'Sullivan

have a suspicion that Mr. Ferrie may have flown Oswald to

Dallas, as reported by Sgt. O'Sullivan in his testimony before

the President's Commission to Investigate the Assassination of

President Kennedy:

"We wanted to check it (Ferrie's plane) to see if it

was flyable, to see possibly whether he had been flying it i

lately, with the thought that he may have transported Oswald to

Dallas."

4. Did the New Orleans Police Department vice squad

know or have reports that Mr. Ferrie and Oswald had

been associating together just prior to this?

19. Have New Orleans police officials interrogated a man

named A. W. Will, a service station operator, who

said in Feburary, 1964, that police officers asked him

if he had ever seen Oswald in the company of a man wearing

a wig? If so, did Mir. Will agree that such questions were

asked him?

20. Did or does David Ferrie wear a wig and/or false

eyelashes? Or false eyebrows?

21. Sam Summerlin, former Associated Press bureau chief

in New Orleans, has been quoted as saying that he got

the impression in late November, 1963, that New Orleans

police officials were convinced that Mr. Ferrie was

involved in some manner in the Kennedy assassination, and

that a biographical sketch was made available for use

if and when Mr. Ferrie was so charged. Is this true?

If so, please explain why the investigating officers

believed this.

22. Nasa Marina Oswald testified before the President's

Commission to Investigate the Assassination of President

Kennedy that when she and Oswald lived on Magazine Street

in the Summer of 1963 that Oswald would sit on the

porch and aim his rifle. Does the apartment house next

job would have provided? Do New Orleans police officials

agree with this? If so, where did the money come from?

FBI agents after his arrest on Aug. 9, was Ir. Martello

present during the interview? Or any other New Orleans

police officer? If so, what was the substance or

investigation of David Ferrie? Which FBI agents?

26. What did Mr. Ferrie's neighbors say?

27. Did anyone ever report having seen Oswald at Mr.

Ferrie's home?

28. A New Orleans singer named Connie Kaye has reported

that she met Oswald in a coffee house in New Orleans in

the Summer of 1963 and that Oswald protested anti-Castro

material she was using in an act at Pat O'Brien's Club.

Do you have reason to believe this? Doubt it?

29. Was Oswald a frequenter of the Havanna Bar in New Orleans?

where Oswald lived in the Summer of 1963 reported that

after Oswald had left on Sept. 25, she found a case of

empty beer bottles. Who drank the beer?

Dear Sir:

I am Eric Crouchet. I was supposed to have been the State Witness

in criminal charges in Louisiana against you= Captain David Ferrie. I am

him, and the way I been treated.

I tried to exonnerate him before to your Captain Greiner, but he

would not give

me the chance. So I am writing to you since you are the

president of the company.

Here is what happened. There is a certain woman here

who has relatives who are big politicians. This woman is a real one, belleve

me.. I am no

doctor but I am sure something is not right with her. She has

been "'after"

Captain Ferrie for a long long time. She nas cooked up more

stories and lies than I can count. Of course he is not the only one. She

has some move on her list that she gives it to,

and I am one of then.What

she has got against me or Captain Ferrie I cannot figure out. She has a

funny pattern. This month it is one person she doesnt like and neat month

it is somebody else. She figures she is the hand

and told them

this. It just was not so. But

how do you stop a lie when it is repeated often

enough and loud enough.

Anyhow after a few days it became apparent that she was wrong and Captain

So I was shook when

I was sixteen Bone round out a few

days later that I was supposed to be State Witness against Captain Ferrie

in criminal charges.

Then I was in contact with Captain Ferrie and had

arrangements to get papers from his lawyer withdrawing the charges. In

a moment of courage

I signed

these. Then I called the cops and told them

what: I did and why. For this

Ferrie with intimidating

The cops were trying to

make this kid be a witness against Captain Ferrie too. This is how it

went. This woman, like I said, has big political connections.

When

I signed these withdrawal I was rousted around again. Then

I got real scared. I had no way to turn. I was scared of this woman,

of the cops,

and whether Captas: Ferrie would sue me for false charges

or. what. so I did the only thing left and took off for service.

The service taught me my rights and what to be afraid of and what

not. When I came home a couple of omnths ago I knew my rights. With my

father and my lawyer I went to the District Attorney and explained the

whole situation. They had no other choice than to drop the charges.

I want to make one thing clear. All of these charges are false.

It just did not happenn.. I am completely exonnerating Captain Ferrie.

I went to your Captain Greiner In New Orleans and I telephoned

your Miami lawyer B1ll Bell. With each one I tried to tell my story and

IK got the brush off. Why wouldnt they let me tell the story?. They

stopped

Then I got to hear some

mighty interesting things. It seems that

Eastern is trying to.collect only the dirt,

and forget the good. What

they have somebody wants

to twist just one

certain way. It

all builds

up to one thing And that 1s this It looks like Eastern has joined this

women to blacken Captain Ferrie. I also found out that either Bill Bell

or George Greiner tried to fire

Ferrie when these charges were first

made:

Does this mean that just to have somebody accuse you of something

Is grounds for dismissal on Eastern? It it does.

Eastern is in bad shape,

and so is the country.

I mean to get my say in this matter. If I dont get it in to you

I will have to find another way. I am

anxious

to get it in now because

there is a comapny called Southern Research,

He encourages kids to aviation

He was talking about roghets a long time ago when his

fellow pilots

laughed at him for it. Some of your pilots today he trained.

Third

he is a good pilot. I have been talking out at New O-leans Airport.

I find he has the best reputation o

the Gulf Coast as an instrument pilot

and everybody agrees that they would wnat him, before anybody else, at

the controls.

Fourth he is safety minded. EVery ody knows how he trained his own copilots

and stewardesses in safety

and emergency measures, and on his own time.

Five he is company minded because he is always running around giving publict

talks for Eastern and on his own time and money.

he never disgraced your company. He did not set fined and have his

Captain Ferrie should be

too?

Milt is a funny thing

a man is down everybody gangs us

on him. In they are jealous or bin they do the sane thing too. So i have

been doing my best to undo the wrongs done him of which I an i part.

I thought Eastern would be interested in the same thing if they were

Christian and American. So far, it seems the other way around.

I have been going around to some business men I know through the

Kiwanis club. I have been telling my story to get this mán's name

cleared. I understand that these are the customers who pay your salary.

Ouc thing I can say,

they showed a good attitude.

They cannot belfare

that Eastern would hold him out of service once this story was told./

This affair.has made me very angry with Eastern Air Lines.

I figured that a man in your position would not want this to go on.

I preferred to think that this was just the conduct of a couple of

minor officials and did not represent the policy of the whole company.

The future will tell.

There are many people here who want to come forward and write

of protest. They have been stopped because someone told them

they. did it would look "rigged up". Do you want to hear from

them. I hope you do:

There is one other thing. My näme has seen linked up to this.

We cannot afford a lawyer to go after

the woman

who started all this.

Her day will come, however. The other day I found

that if Captain

Ferrie does not get back to flying status my name will sugfer

t00.

I dont think Eastern 1s interested in this responsibility too.

So, I hope that you will do the right thins, and the American

and put Captain Ferrie back on flying. I would like to know

what you are going to do.

The Inquest

RAND conspiracies need not be grand. There need be only

a few central figures in a position to manipulate, wheedle,

dupe, blackmail, and buy the bit actors. This is the theory

of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison as applied to the as-

sassination of President Kennedy. "The people who engineered the

killing of one of the finest Presidents weever had are walkingaround

today,

;" he declares. "Not to do anything about it is un-American."

The Louisiana populist can hardly be accused of dis-

loyalty. He has, he claims, discovered who killed Kennedy,

who organized the plot, and what forces were involved in

planning the various steps that led to the assassination.

And he has done all this against formidable odds. He has

been denounced and ridiculed by such columnists as Bob

Considine, Jim Bishop and Victor Reisel. The press has,

for the most part, slanted its coverage of his investigation

to imply motives of personal glory and political gain. The

government Establishment has given him the cold shoul-

der, and the FBI, which "cleared" two of his present

suspects immediately following the assassination, refused

to release its information to him.

The truth, according to Garrison, is certain to rock the

republic as it gradually unfolds in court. He is convinced

that Lee Harvey Oswald was not a triggerman, and that

Jack Ruby was the puppet of a more sophisticated master..

He is equally sure that the working level of the conspiracy

was composed of rabid anti-Castro Cuban exiles in league

with elements of the American paramilitary right. The con-

certed Establishment effort to confine the events of the

thesis: a vertically integrated plot rising step by step into

high echelons of government and the military-industrial

complex. "Honorable men did in Caesar," dryly observes

the prosecutor with a fondness for historical metaphor.

drama have been wildly disparate. On February 22 of this

poured eti his scheme.

"Triangulation.

the availability of exit... one man had to be

sacrificed to give the other one or two gun-

men time to escape." Leon Oswald listened impassively.

So did Clay Bertrand, a tall; courtly, older man with

close-cropped white hair. Bertrand, smartly attired in a

maroon jacket, looked out of place with his carelessly

dressed companions in the disarray of Ferrie's apartment.

This was the scene on or about September 16, 1963, as

described recently in a New Orleans courtroom by Perry

Raymond Russo, Jim Garrison's star witness to date, who

had been present in the Ferrie apartment on that fateful

night. An articulate young insurance salesman for

Equitable Life and a graduate of the Jesuit Loyola Uni-

versity, Russo had passed, for what it is worth, a series of

Sodium Pentothal ("truth serum") tests administered by

medical experts. His story was sufficiently impressive to

cause the three-judge panel to bind over Clay Shaw, whom

Russo identified as Clay Bertrand, for trial in the assassina-

tion of the President.

Following Ferrie's rapid-fire dissertation, said Russo,

the talk switched to escape. Ferrie declared in favor of a

flight to Brazil with a refueling stop in Mexico, or a more

risky hop directly to Cuba. (It is a source of puzzlement

why Ferrie would want to go to Cuba, given his anti-

Castro stance.) Bertrand disagreed, on the grounds that

word of the assassination would spread too fast to permit

a long flight. "Shut up and leave him alone," interjected

Leon Oswald, whom Russo says was Lee Harvey Oswald,

"he's the pilot." "A washed-up pilot," huffed Bertrand,

alluding to Ferrie's dismissal from Eastern Air Lines for

homosexual convictions.

From the conversation, Russo deduced that none of

the three intended to participate actively in the assassina-

tion. Ferrie suggested they "should be in the public eye"

on the day of the attempt; he himself would make a

speech at a nearby college. Bertrand said he would go to

the west coast on business. Oswald said nothing.

Clay Shaw was indeed on the west coast on business on

November 22. Two weeks previously, his manager at the

New Orleans Trade Mart had written the San Francisco

Trade Mart that Shaw would be passing through on that

date and would like to discuss mutual interests with their

executives. At the moment when Kennedy was killed,

Shaw was conferring with the San Francisco men.

Ferrie also had an alibi, of sorts. A New Orleans attor-

ney is fairly certain that on that black Friday, the eccentric

little man was in his law office around 12:15 p.m. Ferrie

contended he was in New Orleans until late in the after-

noon, when he and his two young roommates left on an

impromptu trip to Texas to "hunt geese." On the surface

it was a wild goose chase: the trio drove to Houston on

Friday, to Galveston on Saturday, and returned to New

Orleans on Sunday-over 1000 miles. But Garrison has

witnesses who swear that Ferrie spent several hours at a

Houston skating rink waiting by the telephone: It was a

curious junket at a curious time, so curious that Garrison,

on his own initiative, arrested and held the three for FBI

investigation of "subversive activity."

Garrison charges only that the machinations in Ferrie's

apartment set in motion events that culminated in the

assassination. What direction the substantive plot may

have taken from there is hinted at in the further testimony

of Russo. He had met Ferrie, he said, some four years

earlier through Civil Air Patrol activity, and frequently

was invited to his apartment. There had been a party be-

fore the meeting on the evening in question, and Russo

had lingered after the rest of the guests. Among the last

to leave were several Cubans in military fatigues, two of

whom he recalls by their first names, Manuel and a name

sounding like Julian. Manuel, Garrison suspects, is the

missing Manuel Garcia Gonzales.

The bizarre quality of Ferrie's life followed him into

death. After being questioned by Garrison, he muttered

he did not have long to live. The cause of death, the

coroner revealed, had been an embolism at the base of the

brain induced by hypertension. But a brain embolism

can also be caused by a deftly administered karate chop

to the neck, a technique which possibly killed Dallas

reporter Jim Koethe, who had participated in an enig-

matic meeting at Jack Ruby's apartment the night Oswald

was murdered [Ramparts, November. 1966}.

An inveterate activist, Ferrie solicited funds for Castro

in 1958, then bitterly turned against him when he struck

his communist colors. According to former Havana

journalist Diego Gonzales Tendedera, Ferrie flew fire-

bomb raids and refugee rescue missions to Cuba from

Florida in a twin-engine Piper Apache owned by Eladio

del Valle, an ex-Batista official who had escaped to Miami

with considerable wealth. Ferrie reportedly was paid

$1000 to $1500 a mission, depending on the risk involved.

---

## Page 219

The caper ended in 1961, when U.S. government agents

confiscated the Apache, and Ferrie headed for New

Orleans. On February 22, the day Ferrie died in New

Orleans, del Valle's head was split by a powerful blow

with a machete or hatchet and he was shot over the heart.

Miami police, noting that he had been involved in nar-

cotics smuggling, call

it a gangland slaying.

After the Bay of Pigs, Ferrie boasted he had taken part

in the invasion, and indeed it has come to light that a

CIA-directed diversionary strike had been launched from

a hidden base in the New Orleans area. The loquacious

pilot was openly hostile to President Kennedy for failing

to commit American military might against Castro. On

one occasion a speech he was giving before the New

Orleans Chapter of Military Order of World Wars turned

into a diatribe against Kennedy for a "double-cross" of

the invasion force. Several members walked out and the

chairman abruptly adjourned the meeting.

During this period the conspicuous 'Ferrie was fre-

quently noticed by the New Orleans Cuban colony in the

company of Sergio Aracha-Smith, local director of the

anti-Castro Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front.

(New Orleans police intelligence records reflect, states the

Washington Post, that the Front was "legitimate in nature

and presumably had the unofficial sanction of the Central

Intelligence Agency.") The Lake Pontchartrain water-

front near Aracha's home seems to have become a locus

for mysterious meetings. Various Garrison witnesses claim

to have seen Ferrie there, as well as an exchange of

money between Oswald and Shaw.

By 1963, Aracha apparently had been deposed as Front

director, for he had moved to Houston in 1962 and was

living there at the time of the assassination. In 1964 he

moved to Dallas. When Garrison investigators recently

sought to question him, he refused to talk without police

and Dallas Assistant D.A. Bill Alexander present. How-

ever, Garrison secured a warrant charging him with

conspiring with Ferrie and one Gordon Novel to burglar-

ize an explosives depot of the Schlumberger Well Services

Co. near New Orleans in August 1961. Aracha is presently

free on bond.

The strange behavior of Gordon Novel lends still

another piquant ingredient to the case. Shortly after being

interrogated by Garrison, he hurriedly sold the French

Quarter bar he owned and left town. He turned up in

McLean, Virginia (headquarters of Army intelligence and

CIA), blasted the assassination probe as a fraud, and

noistly submitted to a "private" lie detector test given by a

former Army intelligence officer that, he said, supported

his veracity. In Columbus, Ohio, where he was arrested on

a fugitive warrant obtained by Garrison, he cryptically

stated, "I think Garrison will expose some CIA operations

in Louisiana." In what it called "his unpublished account

of how the explosives disappeared," the New Orleans

States-Item claims that Novel has told several persons

that he, Ferrie, Aracha and several Cubans did not steal

the munitions but transported them to New Orleans at

the instruction of their CIA contact just before the Bay

of Pigs invasion in April 1961. Furthermore, the States-

Item says Novel operated a ClA front, the Evergreen

Advertising Agency, which prepared cryptographical

messages contained in radio commercials for Christmas

trees that alerted agents to the invasion date. Novel, how-

ever, has denied being a CIA agent.

The mysterious explosives theft dovetailed with another

angle in Garrison's investigation—an April 1961 FBI raid

that uncovered a large cache of arms, ammunition and

explosives in a cottage near New Orleans. Garrison's men

are seeking a group of Cubans said to have accumulated

Further CIA aid or comfort for the paramilitary right

wing is suggested by the role of private eye W. Guy

Banister, who with a partner named Hugh F. Ward ran

a private sleuthing agency in New Orleans. Both a former

FBI official and a former superintendent of New Orleans

police, Banister was noted for his outspoken ultracon-

servatism. His office, according to a States-Item inform-

ant, was one of the drops for the stolen munitions. In

1963, the ever-present David Ferrie worked intermittently

for him as an investigator.

While researching an article on The Minutemen [Ram-

parts, January 1967), I learned from a defector-a

Minuteman aide who had access to their headquarters

files — about an allied group in New Orleans known as the

Anti-Communism League of the Caribbean. The League

was said by the aide to have been used by the CIA in its

engineering of the 1954 overthrow of the leftist Arbenz

government in Guatemala. The Minuteman defector said

the names of both Banister and Ward appeared in the

secret Minutemen files as members of the Minutemen and.

as operatives of the Anti-Communism League of the

Caribbean. He also divulged that militant anti-Castro

Cuban exiles were prominent in the Minutemen ranks.

With these pieces of the puzzle beginning to fit to-

gether, Garrison hopes to complete the picture. But he

will get no help from Banister and Ward. Potential wit-

nesses to the assassination secrets seem to have a propen-

sity for dying. In 1964, Banister, who drank heavily and

was given to wild sprees, suddenly died of a heart attack.

On May 23, 1965, Ward, a commercial pilot, was at the

controls of a Piper Aztec chartered by former New Or-

leans Mayor de Lesseps Morrison when the craft, engines

sputtering, crashed on a fog-shrouded hill near Ciudad

Victoria, Mexico. All aboard were killed.

[THE PARAMILITARY OPERATION AT DEALEY PLAZA]

P

RESIDENT KENNEDY'S MURDER had all the ear-

marks of a paramilitary operation. The Dealey

Plaza site was ideal: tall buildings at one end, at

the other a grassy knoll projecting to within a

stone's throw of the roadway and covered by foliage. It

is the opinion of Garrison's investigators, and of this

writer, that the slowly-rolling Presidential limousine was

trapped in a classic guerrilla ambush— with simultaneous

fire converging from the knoll and from a multi-storied

buildin

This was the "triangulation," Russo said, that

David Ferrie had talked about-a sniper in the rear posi-

tion to divert the public's attention while the sniper in

front "could fire the shot that would do the job."

It was, in fact, the frontal fire that did the dreadful job.

The explosive head shot that snapped the President's head

backward and literally blew his brains into the air could

not have been the effect of a high-velocity rifle bullet fired

from the rear-such bullets pierce cleanly (a nurse at

Parkland Hospital said that when doctors attempted a

tracheotomy on the President, the damage was so great

the tube pushed out the back of his head). It was the effect

of a nasty hollow-nose mercury fulminate bullet, gen-

erally known as a "dum dum," which explodes on impact.

Although outlawed by the Hague Convention, exploding

bullets are favored by guerrilla fighters. An ex-CIA agent

who had received paramilitary training from the Agency

advises that the CIA supplied this type of bullet to the

anti-Castro forces it trained.

The first report of the assassination in the Dallas Times-

Herald afternoon edition-before the Warren Commis-

sion's three-shot, "magic bullet" theory was proclaimed-

read: "Witnesses said six or seven shots were fired." A

bullet mark on the curb belatedly analyzed by the FBI

• did not show traces of copper, as would have been the

case had the bullet been the copper-jacketed type al-

legedly fired by Oswald. "There definitely was a shot

fired from behind that fence," insists witness S. M. Hol-

land, referring to the partially concealed picket fence on

the grassy knoll. Holland, a crusty old railroader who

was standing on the Triple Underpass towards which the

President's limousine was heading, is the rare eyewitness

who survived both the bamboozling tactics of the Warren

Commission and Secret Service insistence that he change

his story.

Holland's account is complemented by the testimony

of the late Lee Bowers, who overlooked the parking lot at

the rear of the grassy knoll from his railroad tower.

Bowers said he saw two out-of-state automobiles and a

Texas automobile, apparently equipped with a two-way

radio, prowling the lot shortly before the assassination.

He also noticed two men in the lot near the fence; when

20

RAMPARTS

the shots rang out they were partially obscured by the

trees, but there was "something out of the ordinary, a

sort of milling around."

Jim Garrison agrees that Oswald "was no Captain

Marvel." The D.A. says: "The fatal shots came from the

front." In this context Oswald's indignant protest while

in custody, "I didn't kill anybody ... I'm just a patsy"

may prove, after Garrison finishes, to be true.

There is scientific evidence tending to support it. The

Dallas police made paraffin casts of Oswald's hands and

right cheek in order to chemically test for nitrates. Al-

though many common substances can deposit nitrates,

the blowback from a gun ordinarily deposits an appre-

ciable amount. The test showed positive reactions for

both hands; a negative reaction for the cheek.

Ordinarily, a right-handed man who has shot both a

pistol and a rifle, as Oswald was accused of doing, would

have nitrates on the right hand and cheek. Most likely the

source of the nitrates on Oswald's hands was fingerprint

ink-he had been finger and palm printed before the

paraffin was applied.

Moreover, the FBI subjected the casts to Nuclear

Activation Analysis, a relatively new technique, so sensi-

tive it can detect a thimbleful of acid in a tankcar of

water. Deposits on the casts, the FBI reported, "could

not be specifically associated with the rifle cartridges," but

ballistics expert Cortlandt Cunningham did not view the

result as exculpating Oswald. "A rifle chamber is tightly

sealed," he testified, "and so by its very nature, I would

not expect to find residue on the right cheek of a shooter."

This explanation seemed so implausible I contacted

Dr. Vincent Guinn of General Atomics in San Diego, who

pioneered the development of the NAA process. He said

that he and Raymond Pinker of the Los Angeles police

crime lab were also curious about the test, and ordered an

Italian Carcano rifle such as Oswald supposedly fired.

They fired the obsolete weapon, which some authorities

think is liable to blow up, and tested their cheeks. Nitrates

from the blowback were present in abundance.

[LEE HARVEY OSWALD]

NOTHER COMPONENT of the Garrison theory is that

Oswald was not a dedicated communist at

all, but an agent of the CIA who may have

been trained at the Agency's facility at Atsugi

Air Force Base in Japan in 1959. He was a revolutionary

looking for a revolution-any revolution-and he found

a cause with the CIA-sponsored paramilitary right wing

planning the overthrow of Castro.

The paramilitary right wing is composed of numerous

factions over which the Minutemen exert a loose hegem-

ony. It is cross-pollinized with Birchers, Klanners, States

realized he was a prime suspect in Gar-

rison's probe, Ferrie systematically dis-

posed of his papers and documents for

the years 1962 and 1963. But in photo-

copying the bibliography of a cancer

paper he had written (at one time he had

caged mice in his home on which he

experimented with cancer implants), he

inadvertantly overlapped

the bottom

portion of notes recording the disposi-

tions. Included is the notation: "Copies

of B's (presumably Banister's] microfilm

files to Atlanta rite-wingers [sic]."

The Banister files were reputed to be

the largest

collection of

"anti-com-

munist intelligence" in Louisiana, and

part were sold by his widow to the Sov-

ereignty Commission, a sort of state

HUAC, where a Garrison investigator

was able to examine them. Banister's

filing system was

modeled after the

FBI's, and contained files on both friends

and foes. The "10" and "23" classifica-

tion dealt with Cuban matters; 23-5, for

example, was labeled Cuban Democratic

Revolutionary Front and 10-209 simply

Cuban File. There was a main file, 23-14,

labeled Shaw File, but someone had

completely stripped it before Garrison's

man got there.

by the DA as a material witness in the

March, Novel filed to McLean, Virginia,

next door to the CIA complex at Lang-

istered by a former Army intelligence

cryptically asserted that the munitions

caper was one of "the most patriotic

burglaries in history." When an enter-

prising reporter took him to a marathon

party, Novel's indiscreet tongue loos-

ened further. According to the States-

count was that the munitions bunker

was a CIA staging point for war materiel

destined for use in the impending Bay of

Pigs invasion. He is quoted as saying

that on the day the munitions were

picked up, he "was called by his CIA

contact and told to join a group which

was ordered to transport munitions from

the bunker to New Orleans." The key to

the bunker was provided by his CIA

contact. Novel reportedly said the others

in the CIA group at the bunker were

David Ferrie Sergio Arcacha Smith-

New Orleans delegate to the Cuban De-

mocratic Revolutionary Front-and sev-

eral Cubans. The munitions, according

to his account, were dropped in Novel's

also is rumored to have been the tip-off man between the

Dallas police and the Dallas underworld... Ruby oper-

ated his businesses on a cash basis, keeping no record

whatsoever—a strong indication that Ruby himself was

involved in illicit operations of some sort... His primary

technique in avoiding prosecution was the maintenance

of friendship with police officers, public officials,

and

other influential persons in the Dallas community."

Nor did the letter ignore Ruby's affinity for Cuba. "In

about 1959, Ruby became interested in the possibility

of selling war materials to Cubans and in the possibility

of opening a gambling casino in Havana." The pushy

entrepreneur's continuing interest in Cuba was discussed.

CIA, instructed the Commission staffers, should con-

sider the possibility of "ties between Ruby and others

who might have been interested in the assassination of

President Kennedy." They specifically mentioned a num-

ber of people thought to know Ruby, including former

Havana gambler Lewis J. McWillie, a Birch Society

official, and oilmen H. L. and Lamar Hunt.

For months the CIA was silent. When finally dunned

by the Commission it simply said that its files contained

"no information on Jack Ruby or his activities" or any

link with Oswald. The reply came after the Commission

had concluded its deliberations.

"There is much more to Ruby than meets the eye,"

attests one of Garrison's chief sleuths, Louis Gurvich.

Garrison has produced a former Dallas cab driver, Ray:

mon Cummings, who is prepared to testify he twice drove

Oswald ta Ruby's Carousel Club, once in the company

of David Ferrie

Chere alread

exists a body of evidence tying Oswald

to Ruby. For example, there is Wilbryn Waldon "Bob"

Litchfield II, who claimed he saw Oswald waiting to see

Ruby at the club a month before the assassination. Litch-

field was waiting to see Ruby himself, and accurately

described a third man-whose presence has been verified.

There is also Carroll Jarnagin, an attorney reputed to

have a photographic memory. In a voluntary statement to

the FBI, Jarnagin told of overhearing an ear-pricking

colloquy between Oswald and Ruby in the Carousel Club

the night of October 4, 1963. The gist of it was that Os-

wald was to be hired to assassinate Texas Governor John

Connally with a rifle from a high building. Bobby Ken-

nedy had clamped down on racket activity in Chicago

and Castro had ousted the American gamblers from

Cuba. The reasoning was that if the straightlaced Con-

nally could be eliminated, Texas, which is "right next to

Mexico," could be opened up and "there'd be money

for everybody."

Jarnagin's testimony was discounted by the Warren

Commission, largely on the strength of a lie detector test

" The Inquest"

given by D.A. Henry Wade. The result, claimed Wade,

was that Jarnagin was sincere but his story "fanciful" -

a determination well beyond the capacity of a polygraph.

Ruby's gangster links are well established, and his

connection

with one Paul Rolland Jones is a story in

itself. Jones averred he had been introduced to Ruby in

Chicago in the late 1940's by several syndicate hoods, and

later got to know Jack and his sister Eva, who ran the.

Singapore Club in Dallas, quite well. He had come to

Dallas as an emissary of the mob to negotiate "a piece

of the action."

He approached then-sheriff Steve Guthrie and an ob-

scure lieutenant on the police force, George Butler, to

arrange for protection. The two pretended to play along,

then sprung a trap on Jones and charged him with

bribery. Butler became a hero of sorts, and was tapped

to assist the Kefauver Committee in its 1950 rackets

hearings. But Jones told the FBI he believes Butler was

at first in earnest and wanted a pay-off, desisting only

when he learned the Texas Rangers were wise to the

negotiations.

Butler is still a lieutenant, working out of the juvenile

bureau. The assignment seemingly permits him leeway

for his activities as the self-professed leader of extreme

right wing elements on the force. In 1961, while in rural

Midlothian, Texas, to make an anti-communist speech, he

offered Penn Jones Jr., the scrappy editor of the Mid-

lothian Mirror, the opportunity to print a statewide

newspaper under the auspices of the Ku Klux Klan. He

boasted, Jones says, that one half of the police force

belonged to the KKK. He frequently escorts H. L. Hunt

to various public engagements.

It was Lt. George Butler who was in overall charge of

the transfer of Oswald on November 24 and who gave the

"all clear" te bring the prisoner into the basement.

Early in 1959, when Castro came to power, Ruby

looked covetously to Cuba. He made overtures to sell

surplus jeeps to the Cuban premier, and tried to wangle

a letter of introduction from a known Castro partisan

in Houston. Late in 1959 he visited gambler Lewis

McWillie in Havana on what he later called a "purely

social" trip. While there he boasted to at least two U.S.

citizens that he was "in with both sides." Most prominent

of the anti-Castroites whose friendship he claimed was

Rolando Masferrer, a Batista henchman.

Ruby's Cuba interests and crime syndicate connections

converge in the testimony of Nancy Perrin Rich, a fast-

living young lady four times around the marriage cycle

and a one-time police informant. In 1962, she arrived in

Dallas on the heels of her then husband, Robert Perrin,

who at various times had been a bodyguard to top hood-

lums, a narcotics smuggler and a gun-runner to Franco

The true nature of the group raided at

from the story. The FBI announced no

arrests, and the wife of the property

owner, Mrs. William J. McLaney, gave

out the cover story that the premises had

been loaned to a newly-arrived Cuban

named Jose Juarez as a favor to friends

in Cuba. (McLaney had been well

known as a gambler associated with the

Tropicana Hotel in Havana before being

ousted by Castro in 1960.)

According to information leaked to

Garrison by another government agency,

Rampants

Jan. 68

the FBI had in fact arrested 11 men, then

quietly released them. Among those in

the net was Acelo. Pedro Amores, be-

lieved to be a former Batista official who

slipped out of Cuba in

1960.

Also

caught was Richard Lauchli Jr, one of

the founders of the Mintemen. Lauchli,

who poescssed a federal license to manu-

facture weapons in his Collinsville, Illi-

nois machine shop, was arrested again

in 1964 when Treasury investigators,

posing as agents of a South American

country, trapped him in a deal to sell a

huge quantity of illicit automatic arms.

The others arrested were American ado

venturers and Cuban exiles.

several abortive assassination schemes

tremist using the pseudonym John Mor-

ris was given money by & Minutemen

Cly to subsidize the sniper saying of

Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkan-

in a plana flown by a Texas man, but

DePugh got wind of it and aborted it.

And a Cuban exile close to Guy Banister

has told Garbon that in 1962 Minute

Oswald ti,st

An intriguing entry in Oswald's ad-

dress book is the word "microdots"

appearing on the page on which he has

notated the address and phone number

of Jaggers-Chiles-Stovall (CF 18, p. 45).

Microdot:

area clundestine means of

communition developed ly German

intelligence during World War II and

sull in general use among espionage

agencies The technique is to photograph

the document in he transmitted and

vastly reduce the negate to a size that

will fit inside a period. The microdot

can be inserted in an innocuous letter or

magazine and mailed, or left in a "dead

drop'-a prearranged location for the

deposit and pickup of messages.

Thus it may be significant that Oswald

obtained library cards in Dallas and

New Orleans. and usually visited the

libraries on Thursday. The possible im-

plication of his visits was not overlooked

by the FBI, which confiscated every book

he ever charged out, and never returned

them. A piece that may fit into the puzzle

is the discovery by Garrison of an adult

borrower's card issued by the New Or-

leans public library in the name Clem

Bertrand. The business address shown is

the International Trade Mart [Shaw's

former place of employment], and the

home address 3100 Louisiana Avenue

Parkway, a wrong number, but conspic-

uously close to that of David Ferrie at

3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway. There

may be a pattern here, since Oswald sup-

posedly carried a card issued to Ferrie

when arrested in Dallas.

Still another hint of Oswald's intelli-

gence Status is the inventory of his prop-

erty seized by Dallas police after the

assassination. Included is such sophisti-

cated optical equipment as a Sterio

filters, a small German camera, a Wol-

lensak 15 power telescope, Micron 6X

hinoculars and a variety of film- hardly

the usual accouterments of a lowly ware-

houseman (Stovall Exhibits).

Upon his return from Russia, the man

w hr subscribed to Pravda in the Marine

Corps and lectured his fellow Marines

on Marxist dialectics set about insti-

rutionalizing his leftist facade. He wrote

, ingratiating letters to the national head-

quarters of the Communist Party, Fair

Play for Cuba Committee and Socialist

Workers Party (a copy of the famous

snapshot of Oswald with a revolver on

his hip, a rifle in one hand and the Party

organ, the Militant, in the other was

mailed to the SWP office in New York

in April 1963). Garrison believes the

facade was intended to facilitate his

entry into communist countries for spe-

cial missions.

Donald P. Norton. Wire, runs he was

impressed into the Agency's service in

1957 under threat of exposure as a homo-

sexual. In September 1962, Norton re-

lated, he was dispatched from Atlanta

to Mexico with $50,000 for an anti-

Castro group. He had no sooner regis-

tered in the Yamajel Hotel in Monterrey,

Mexico, per instructions, than he was

contacted by one Harvey Lee, a dead

ringer for Oswald except that his hair

seemed slightly thicker. In exchange for

the money, Lee gave him a briefcase

containing documents in manila en-

velopes. According to plan, Norton de-

livered the briefcase to an employee of

an American oil firm in Calgary, Alber-

ta, who repeated the pass phrase, "The

weather is very warm in Tulsa."

Norton also contends he met David

Ferrie earlier in his CIA career. In early

1958, he was tapped for a courier trip to

Cuba and told to meet his contact at the

Eastern Air Lines counter at the Atlanta

airport. The contact

was it singular-

was Ferrie.

"Here are your simples."

Ferrie

remarked, handing Norion

"It" was $150,000, which Norton duly

delivered to a Cuban television perform-

er in Havana. Norton asserts he went 10

Freeport, Grand Bahamas, on an Agency

assignment late in 1966, and upon his

return to Miami his contact instructed

that "something was happening in New

Orleans, and that I [Norton] should take

a long, quiet vacation."

He did, and started to fret about the

"people wbo have died in recent months

like Ferries" Then he decided to con-

tact Garrison. Norton was given a lie

detector test, and there were no indica-

tions of deception.

Fine

Ferrie's involvement with the CIA

seems to stem mainly from his anti-

Castro paramilitary activity, although

there is a suggestion that he was at one

time a pilot for the Agency. In the late

1940s and early 1950s he flew light

planes commercially in the Cleveland,

Ohio area, and was rated by his col-

leagues as an outstanding pilot. In the

middle 1950s there is an untraceable gap

in his career. Then he turns up as an

Eastern Air Lines pilot. Although he

supposedly obtained an instrument rat-

ing at the Sunnyside Flying School in

Tampa, Florida, there is no record that

any such school ever existed.

A clue to Ferrie's activities may lie in

the loss of hair he suffered. A fellow em-

ployee at Eastern recalls

that when

Ferrie first joined the line he was "hand-

some and friendly," but in the end be-

came "moody and paranoiac-afraid the

communists were out to get him." The

personality

change coincided with

gradual loss of hair. First a bald spot

appeared, which Ferrie explained was

caused by acid dripping from a plane

battery. Then the hair began falling out

Map by John Williams

in clumps-Ferrie desperately studied

medicine to try to halt the process-

until his body was entirely devoid of

hair. One speculation is that he was

moonlighting and suffered a physiolog

ical reaction to exposure to the extreme

altitudes required for clandestine flights.

Chinese Nationalist U-2 pilots report-

edly have suffered the same hair-loss

phenomenon.

One of Ferrie's covert tasks in the New

Orleans area was to drill small teams in

guerrilla warfare. One

of his young

proteges has revealed that he trained

some of his Civil Air Patrol cadets and

Cubans and formed them into five-man

small weapons units, this under the

auspices of the Marine Corps and State

Department. Coupled with this is the

information from another former pro-

lege that Ferrie confided "he was work-

ing for the CIA rescuing Cubans out of

Castro prisons," and on one occasion

was called to Miami so that the CIA

could "test him to see if he was the type

of person who told his business to any-

body." In a speech before the Military

Order of World Wars in New Orleans in

late 1961; Ferrie related that he had

trained pilots in Guatemala for the Bay

of Pigs, and professed bitter disappoint-

ment that they were not used.

SO THE PROBE REFOCUSED ON Ferrie,

December

15 he was

I brought in for further questioning.

Asked pertinent details of the whirlwind

Texas trip in 1963, he begged lack of

memory and referred his questioners to

the FBI. What about the goose hunting?

"We did in fact get to where the geese

were and there were thousands," he re-

counted.

"But you couldn't approach

them. They were a wise bunch of birds."

• Pressed for details of what took place at

the ice rink, Ferrie became irritated. "Ice

skate-what do you think?" he snapped.

It didn't take the DA's men long to

poke holes in Ferrie's story. Melvin

Coffey, one of his companions on the

1963 Texas trip, deposed that it was not

a sudden inspiration:

Q. The trip was arranged before?

A. Yes.

Q. How long before?

A. A couple of days.

The probers also determined that no one

had taken along any shotguns on the

"goose-hunting" trip.

In Houston, the ice skating alibi was

similarly discredited. In 1963, the FBI

had interviewed Chuck Rolland, proprie-

tor of the Winterland Skating

Rink.

"FERRIE contacted him by telephone

November 22, 1963, and asked for the

skating schedule," a Bureau report, one

of the few unclassified documents on

Ferrie, reveals.

"Mr. FERRIE stated

that he was coming in from out of town

and desired to do some skating while in

Houston. On November 23, 1963, be-

tween 3:30 and 5:30 PM, Mr. FERRIE

and two companions came to the rink

and talked to Mr. ROLLAND." The

report continues that Ferrie and Rolland

had a short general conversation, and

that Ferrie remarked that "he and his

companions would be in and out of the

skating rink during the weekend" (Com-

mission Documents 301). When Garri-

son's men recently talked to Rolland,

they obtained pertinent facts that the

FBI had either missed or failed to report

in 1963. Rolland was certain that none

of the three men in Ferrie's party had ice

skated; Ferrie had spent the entire two

hours he was at the rink standing by a

pay telephone-and finally received a call.

At Houston International Airport,

more information was gleaned. Air serv-

ice personnel seemed to recall that in

1963 Ferrie had access to an airplane

based in Houston. In this craft, the flight

to Matamoros would take little more

than an hour.

Ferrie had patently lied about the pur-

pose of the trip. One of the standard

tactics of bank robbers is to escape from

the scene of the crime in a "hot car" that

cannot be traced to them, then switch

to a "cold car" of their own to complete

the getaway. Garrison considers it pos-

sible that Ferrie may have been the pilot

of a second craft in a two-stage escape of

the Dallas assassins to south of the

border, or may have been slated to be a

backup pilot in the event contingency

plans were activated.

Did Ferrie know Oswald? The pilot

denied it, but the evidence mounts that

he did. For example, there is now in

Garrison's hands information that when

Oswald was arrested by Dallas police, he

had in his possession a current New Or-

leans library card issued to David Ferrie.

Reinforcing the validity of this informa-

tion is a Secret Service report on the

questioning of Ferrie by that agency

when he was in federal custody in 1963.

During an otherwise mild interrogation,

Ferrie was asked, strangely enough, if he

lent his library card to Oswald. No, he

replied, producing a card from the New

Orleans public library in the name Dr.

David Ferrie. That card had expired.

When he realized he was a suspect in

Garrison's current investigation, Ferrie

seemed to deteriorate. By the time he

died on February 22, 1967, he was a

nervous wreck, subsisting on endless

cigarettes and cups of coffee and enough

tranquilizers to pacify an army. He had

sought out the press only days before his

death, labeling the probe a "fraud" and

complaining that he was the victim of a

"witch hunt." "I suppose he has me

Page 228

pegged as a getaway pilot," he remarked

bitterly.

When Garrison delivered his epitaph

of Ferrie as "one of history's most im-

portant individuals," most of the press

winked knowingly. The probe was, after

all, a publicity stunt, and the DA had

had his headlines.

Now that his prime

suspect had conveniently passed away,

he had the perfect excuse to inter his

probe alongside the deceased pilot.

But for DA Jim Garrison, it was not

the end but the beginning.

ber 22, 1963, there were many men in

many places glancing at their watches.

But if we do not fight for the truth now,

we may never have another chance."

[THE FBI CLEARS A SUSPECT]

N THE MORNING AFTER the assassi-

nation, as the nation lay stunned

by grief, Garrison summoned

his staff to the office for a "brainstorm-

ing session" to explore the possibility

that Lee Harvey Oswald had accomplices

in New Orleans, where the previous sum-

mer he had stumped the streets advocat-

ing Fair Play for Cuba.

The DA's men put out feelers into the

city's netherworld, and it was First As-

sistant DA Frank Klein who registered

the first feedback. A slight, furtive, some-

time private eye named Jack S. Martin

confided that a David William Ferrie

had taken off on a sudden trip to Texas

the afternoon of the assassination. The

tipster knew Ferrie well, although there

was bad blood between them.

Both

had worked intermittently for the same

detective firm,

W. Guy Banister

Associates,

and were affiliated with

the

Apostolic Orthodox Old Catholic

Church, a sect steeped in theological

anti-communism.Anexceptionallyskilled

pilot, Ferrie had been dismissed from

Eastern Air Lines in 1962 due to pub-

licity over alleged homosexual activities.

According to Martin, Ferrie had com-

manded a Civil Air Patrol squadron of

which Oswald had once been a member.

He had taught Oswald to shoot with a

telescopic sight, and had become in-

volved with his protege in an assassina-

tion plot. Less than two weeks before the

target date, Ferrie had made a trip to

Dallas. His assigned role in the assassina-

tion, Martin said, was to fly the escaping

conspirators to Matamoros, Mexico,

near Brownsville, Texas.

When Ferrie returned to New Orleans

on the Monday following President

Kennedy's death, he was interrogated by

the DA's office. He said his trip had been

arranged "on the spur of the moment."

With two companions, Alvin Beauboeuf

and Melvin Coffey, he had driven straight

through to Houston Friday night. On

Saturday afternoon, the three skated at

an ice rink; that evening they made the

short jog to Galveston and hunted geese

Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon they

headed back to New Orleans, but de-

toured to Alexandria, Louisiana, to visit

relatives of Beauboeuf.

Garrison was unconvinced by Ferrie's

account. An all-night dash through the

worst rainstorm in years to start a mer-

curial junket of over 1000 miles in three

days for recreational purposes was too

much to swallow. "It was a curious trip

to a curious place at a curious time,"

the DA recalls. He booked Ferrie as a

"fugitive from Texas" and handed him

over to the FBI. The G-men questioned

him intensively, then released him.

Since the 40-odd pages recording the

FBI interrogation of Ferrie are still

classified in the National Archives, one

can only surmise the reasons the Bureau

stamped its file on him "closed."

Apparently the FBI did not take the

pilot too seriously. A short Bureau docu-

ment in the National Archives reveals

Ferrie had admitted being "publicly and

privately" critical of Kennedy for with-

holding air cover at the Bay of Pigs, and

had used expressions like "he ought to

be shot," but agents agreed he did not

mean the threat literally.

Most convincing at the time, the fact

that Ferrie did not leave New Orleans

until hours after

the

assassination

seemed to rule out his role as a getaway

pilot. Moreover, the Stinson monoplane

he then owned was sitting at Lakefront

Airport in unflyable condition.

Accepting the FBI's judgment, Garri-

son dropped his investigation.

"I had

full confidence in the FBI then," he ex-

plains. "There was no reason to try and

second guess them."

constraint barely sufficient "for a man

to get off two shots from a bolt-action

rifle, much less three."

The DA's mind reverted to the strange

trip of pilot David Ferrie, and he began

to wonder how perceptive the FBI had

really been in dismissing the whole thing.

When he returned to New Orleans, he

went into virtual seclusion in his study

at home, lucubrating over the volumes

of the Warren Report. When he became

convinced that Oswald could not have

acted alone, and that at least a phase of

the conspiracy had been centered in New

Orleans, he committed his office to a

full-scale probe. He launched it quietly,

preferring to work more efficiently in

the dark.

Yeah, I imagine it keeps you pretty busy.

PB

But those names mean

absolutely nothing to me.

RB

Uh huh. Do you know anybody close to you that was discussing

uh I'm not trying to dig some information out of someone,

but I'm trying to find out how this got initiated so that

• I can...

PB

'trace it down, I understand.

RB

Right, in other words get it right back to the fountainhead

and either say that uh this is what caused a misreport or

just, you know.

PB

The people I run around with socially are all my partners

and

uh like myself we're really not interested in this in this

proceeding at all I mean we talk about our own law, legal

problems, you know.

RB

Would anyone play any pranks on you that would uh telephone

pranks or anything?

PB

No, not that I know of Dick.

RB . Um hum

PB

Except I did get a little prank that I thought was quite

funny not too long ago in the mail about whether or not I'd

take the place of some herman who was sitting as an idiot

for some

evangelist I think or something of that nature.

RB

Uh huh, did you ever find out who did it?

PB

No, I

never

did, uh uh.

RB.

Now would admiralty practice unless you're representing

claimants you wouldn't have many people that would go out

with uh any vindictiveness enough

to do something.

PB

Well no because my clients are all insurance (inaudible)

I'm strictly defense.

RB

Yeah

PB

And all my contacts are all London really.

RB

Right so you wouldn't have this kind of thing.

PB

No uh uh

RB

Well

you've helped me a lot. Now I'm going to get this

memorandum from HUGH CRAIN that I'm referring to here and I'm

going to go over it and it may have some information in there

that we can check out or you can recognize or something so I

can trace this down and uh they may be even mistaken about

the PATRICK BURKE.

Oh, here's another thing, have you ever

been mistaken for another BURKE who's an attorney not in Orleans?

MEMORANZUM

January 25,

1968

TO :

JIM GARRISON, District Attorney.

FROM:

RICHARD V. BURNES, Assistant, District Attorney

RE:

CLAY SHAW CONSPIRACY TO MURDER JOHN F. KENNEDY

= -

On January 11; 1968, I returned a telephone call

which our office received on January 10, 1968. The call came

from Nowatea, Oklahoma.

The calling number was 273-3226.

The calling party was a MR. ROBINSON.

The telephone is not

that of MR. ROBINSON's, but that of

a' neighbor's.

MR. ROBINSON read to me a statement from a JOHN M.

TUCKER which he had received.

The statement related to the

involvement of DAVE FERRIE and CLAY SHAW in a conspiracy to

• murder John F. Kennedy. MR. ROBINSON does not know the present

location of JOHN TUCKER, but he will forward the letter to us

and attempt to locate TUCKER. A transcript of the conversation

is attached.

on the above date putting my signature to it that its authority

will be known.

I was in New Orleans in the first--wait just a

second--in the first quarter of 1962 and there I met an individual

now under investigation for the conspiracy of the murder of

John F. Kennedy. At the time I did not know of any conspiracy

or plan and was never a member of any right or left wing party

merely an individual exposed for a short time to the planning of

a distorted person.

I judge the individual to be something of a

However, since

homosexual and thought to go along for a laug. to realize that

the beginning of this investigation I have come

the individual was none other than FERRIE--is that it--

R. He introduced himself and is now deceased. I was introduced to

Uh huh

R. No, Muskogee is right over here by Tulsa.

B. Oh, 'I see. You wouldn't know how to get in touch with him now?

R. : : No, not

right off I wouldn't, but I could probably write a letter

make two or three phone calls and get in touch with him.

B. I would like to get in touch with him, you know,

a witness.

I'd also like to get a copy of that statement if it's at all

possible.

R. Well that's the reason why I saved it.

B. . Uh huh

R.. He told me that if anything was to happen to him to mail this to

you.

B. Uh huh

R. I decided I'd go ahead and do it anyway.

B.

well if you would, it would help us an awful lot you know for us

to have this information. I'd really like to get, you know, the

name of your daddy so that I could locate you through him in case

we ever lost connection with each other if you feel like you can

give it to me now I wouldn't alert him to anything, you know, if

I had to call you.

R.

Well, I'll tell you what. : .

B.

You see what my problem is that you may move and you may be

intending to let me know and a couple of weeks may pass or something

and uh it would help a lot if I knew how to get in touch with you!

R. Well if you want to write a letter or if you want to call me, you

can call me at this phone number because I'll always be within

hollering distance of it.

B.

something connecting a

see why

that he didn't because

he's that type of person anyway.

B. Um hum, you mean he's involved in criminal conduct himself?

B...

about a big politician, but I didn't know what or who at the time.

B.

Uh huh

R. And FERRIE introduced me to several people.

B.

Uh huh.

any time?

Did he ever mention the name of CLAY SHAw to you at

R. If he's known as BERT, he did but otherwise I couldn't say.

B.

Well, this is going to help us a lot.

I do wish you could tell

us how to get in touch with TUCKER you know someway where we could

see if he wants to help us.

R.

And if I can get in touch with him I'll have to--I don't know

what he'll say.

B.: Um hum

R.: But he was had a feeling he was going to get into bad trouble

or something over there.

B. Um hum

R. And he told me if he did come up missing or anything like that

to mail this letter down there to Mr. Garrison.

B.

Al1 right well let me say this.

If he didn't have any part in

any plan of plot or conspiracy, there's no way that he could get'

in trouble from us uh if he's a witness there's just no way that

he could get in any trouble.

Quite frankly if he

took part in

something like that, he would be in trouble if we found out about

it uh naturally, but the point of it is if he's just a witness,

just happened to be there and had no participation, he'd have

nothing to worry about and if we used him as a witness and he had

to come down here, we would certainly pay the expenses to bring

him down here which you know we're required to do under law

anyway.

But we would try not to embarrassed him.

I'd quite

frankly like to talk to him and see if uh what information he

has.

Do you think he was telling you the truth or do you think

that he was making it up?

R. Yes, I really believe the boy was.

B.: Well I. . .

R.

He has no reason to tell me lies about anything and the way he

talked we were always discussing socialism and what not.

B. Uh huh

R. And uh he's pretty well set on his way of life.

B.: Uh huh. Well if you can help me get him to find out how to locate

him, I will certainly appreciate it and I will look forward to the

These pages constitute the appendix to the document. There are no references

to any proper names in the index. They probably contain references to the

reliability of various FBI "confidential informants", as in the appendices

to other FBI documents.

There is some indication that the list of names to be found on pp t

572-574 are of people who obtaired lexican travel visas in New Orleans

at around the same time as Oswald. This is anyway true of Gaudet, North

and Merrill, and a few others who are mentioned on other, unclassified

Gaudet (FO Box 365, Waveland, Mississippi) "also indicated that

he has id the past been an employee of the CIA." (p 588).

There are a total of 116 classified pages in this document, or slightty

less than one-sixth of the total number of pages.

another.

and it passed the PAA. We also studied mathemties

aerodynamios and physics. I learned geometry in about

three weeks this way.

&. What was the object or purpose of the squadron?

A. Most of us wanted careers in aviation. Elther we wanted

to go to the Air Force Academy, or AVlation Cadets,

or in aeroscience, We don't have a very good school

system and this was the best way to get the things we

needed but did not know. Captain Perrie had helped

4 fellows Into the Air Force Academy before and we knew

he could help us. That was why we went to him and asked

him to form this squadron

that Ferrie can

gain an acquittal: in his impending cases in the courts

of Orleans and Jefferson parishes.

Investigating officers would also point out that later once hung

around a skating rink and knew many young boys, which include Bobach and

Marsch,

whom Cater knew only as "Butch".

Thus, Cater would be a

good target

for

Ferrie's threats and intimidation..

I told him that I had a good

idea and he said "I'd like to meet you tomorrow",

"I have a proposition".

•I suspected that it was David Ferrie on the phone, because I had

about him and the trouble he was causins between workaree like oracket?

and other bots.

I was nervous about him calling at my work and I didn't

know what to do, so I just told him that I would meet him.

where was a good place to meet and I told him Walgreen's on Canal Street,

because I was familiar with the location as I past

this place every day.

I picked this place because it was safe and I didn't want to be a10ng

He hung up after a short conversation.

I tried to get Mr. Crouchet that same night but changed my mina because

I didn't want to disturb them.

and meet Ferrie and said that he would notify the police.

in front of the center theatre. It looked like a Chetrolet covertible

to me and Butch was driving it. Ferrie wanted to drive around the block

because he was expecting some kid to meet him there.

The kid didn't show

up, so then wes drove up Tulane Avenue into the Carrollton section and

started talking while driving.

We drove to some Royal Castle rest-

but I don't remember where it was because I was nervous an

unfamiliar with the neighborhood.

Ferrie talked about his case and

explained to me that if Mike Crouchet would not testify, no one would

get into trouble.

He stated that he had affadavits against me and thex

Crouchet and the hockey players at the skating rink.

He stated that

it would be very serious

for us, if the Crouchet boy testified against

him. He asked me to get Mike to change his mind,

not talk, and testify

against him.

who are involved, because he was interested in boys.

my house on several occasions on sex parties.

with Bastern. CREINR was informed by this group that charges

presently pending in Jefferson Parish against the subject were to

be dismissed and these people implied that the charge of intimidation

against the subject in Orleans Parish was slated to be dismissed in

view of the reluctance of the complaining witness, BRIC CROUCHEI, to

substantiate his original statement.

Captain CREINER told the source he had advised this group that

the matter of the subject's reinstatement was not nithin the realm

as his authority.

In viow or the above information, Orleans Parish District

advised that his office presently has no intention of disnissing the

pending charge against FERRIE relative to intimidation and extortion

against the complaining witness, ERIC CROUCHEI, regardless of

CROUCHT's feelings at the present time. BECKER stated that in view

of the stateuent previously furnished by CROUCHEI in this matter the

District Attorney intended to proceed in due course and allow hin

the opportunity of repudiating said statenent under oath if CROUCHEI

so desired.

who was possibly residing in New Orleans: The subject had no

military record known to hin. He advised that subject hated women,

seemed to hate Southerners, and at one time threatened to sue him

FERRIE appeared to be well educated and in his, MIESTER's,

opinion had been educated in a seminary school. He advised the

subject allegedly has a Ph.D, but this had never been confirmed.

PERRIE had attended a school in Cleveland, Ohio, having a double

name which he could not recall; this is possisly Western-Reserve.

He

advised FERRIE also allegedly attended Phoenix University but this

FERRIS wears a toupee, possibly selí-made, is a very aggressive

person, highly obnoxious at tines, very influential with people. He

advised that he had heard through Cadet sources, whom he did not name,

that subject is possibly a homosexual.

MIESIER advised that he knew an individual, whon he refused to

were dropped, he (this person) would go to the District Attorney and

give then enough information to put FERRIE away for a long tine."

advised on November 13, 1952 that he represented KERRY KING in charges

that grew out of the so-called "Sex Ring" in Jeilerson Parish, This

group was composed almost entirely of juveniles. MI. HOWARD said ha

did not remember the nane DAVID FERRIB eveI being mentioned in that

case. He went through his file on this case and zone of the juveniles

in that case were the same as those mentioned in various chaigas

against FERRIE..

On Novenber 15, 1952, an individual formerly employed as an

Investigator for a Federal law enforcement agency advised he once

sent in a nissing person complaint as well as an alleged violation of

the law regarding the theit of covernment property.

This source advised the investigative file is no longer available

to him nor is he in a position to testily to the results of his

findings. However, the following account is his best recollection

of the intoraaiion he developed during the course of his inquiry.

The case was assigned in August, 1951, following a visit to the

agency by the parents of a white, male juvenile whose whereabouts

was unknown, (In all probability this is the incident concerning

source could not remember the names of the parties involved.)

According to the parents, their son had been associating with the

subject to the point where he had convinced him to te disobedient to

their wishes and FERRIE had made it possible for the boy to run away

fIon bone and go to Houston. Ine parents said their son had net

FERRIE through activitles of the Civil AlI Patrol. From information

gained through discussion with parents of other children who vere

also in the CAP unit, the parents of the missing youngster had come

to have serious doubts as to the legal status of the unit FERRIS

commanded.

They had heard that this CAP unit was without official

sanction. The source advised that before any extensive inquiry was

nade. Into the boy's whereabouts he was advised by the parents they

had been successiul In locating the boy through persons associated

with FERRIE.

Information was received by this source that fERRIS allegedly

had taken and kept in his possession some filn of novies that were

technically the property of the United States AlI Force. Inquiry:

was then made to detemine whether or not faRRIE was involved in tha

Theft of Government Property.

At this time the source interviewed the Ali foIce Liaison

Captain whose name is not remembered by the source, advised that

FERRIE's association with the CAP was not legitimate as his renoval

from that group had been requested and effected approximately two

years previously as a result of

several incidents which occurred in

the Summar of 1958 or 1959 during the PatIol'S Surer encampuent at

Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi.

on that occasion the nembers were assigned to various barzacks.

the Senlor Advisors, Squadron Commandants and officers were assigned

quarters other than those given the cadets. FERRIE complained

bitterly that he should be permitted to reside with the menbers of

his group in their barracks.

This was strictly against all esisting

policy and when FERRIE continued his insistence that he be quartered

with his group of boys he was ordered by his superior officers not to

stay in the cadet barracks.

shortly after this order, FERRIE was discovered living in the

barracks in defiance of the order and in the ensuing uproar he was

ordered to leave the base.

He departed and took nost of the members

of his group with him although the encampment was not ended. He then

fored his own squadion without official sanction.

The AlI FoICe Liaison OfficeI told the source that during the

subsequent inquiry by the CAP and Air Force Investigative agencies,

several rumors were received concerning FERRIE'S actions with the

boys under his supervision.

the curient New Orleans City Directory reflects three persons

with the name GEORGE PIAZZA, however, the most likely one is GOrGE

PIAZZA, 539 Henry Clay Avenue, New Orleans, whose employment is showa

with the Louisiana AlI. National Guard. It was determined through a

pretext telephone call to DEANNA C. PIAZZA at that address that her

husband, GORGE, is presently attending the School of Law at Loyola

university. She advised he is employed by the Louisiana AlI National

quard as an alert pilot, when he is not attending class.

Attempts were made to interview GORGE PIAZZA On November 14

and 15, 1962 with negative results.

On November 16, 1962, GORGB L. RISLEY interviewed GIORGE PIAZZA

in the law library at Loyola University at which time PIAZZA furnished

the following information:

PIAZZA readily admitted he was the individual involved in the

particular incident referred to by MI. TOLAN, PIAZZA net PERRIE

sonetime in late 1952 when he was in the process of obtaining his

private pilot's license at the New Orleans Alzport. At the time he

was fifteen years of age and became acquainted with FERRIE as just

another pilot who flew hia own alsplane from the field. PIAZZA said

FERRIE owned a Stinson Voyager, nich is still kept at the New Orleans

Airport by FERRIE.

During the course of their contacts through the nutual interest

of Flying, FERRIB

made his plane available to PIAZZA for flying tine.

He offered instruction as well, according to PIAZZA.

At this time, FERRIE ran a CAP Squadron there and PIAZZA jolned.

After obtaining his private license, PIAZZA said FERRIE and he would

Irequently take cross-country trips to Houston, Corpus Chrieti and

San Antonio, Texas. On many Occasions, PIAZZA accompanied faRRIs to

Cleveland, Ohio where they would visit FERRIE's nother, when she was

still alive. FERRIB has a brothes, whose nage is not recalled, who

is presently employed with the Firestone Tire and rubber Company in

Akron, Ohio.

FERRIE has no children either by adoption of marriage and to

PIAZZA's knowledge, he has never been married.

Dusing these frequent flying trips with FERRIE, usually in his

private plane, they generally stayed at the same hotel frequented

by Bastern cres. PIAZZA can only recall one occasion wen they

spent the night at soms place other than one of these

hotels and this

was on one occasion when they visited Corpus Christi, Texas and spent

the night at the rectory of a Catholic Church. The priest there,

whose name is not recalled by PIAZZA, was a friend of FERRIE and

provided rooms for them.

PIAZZA is of the recollection that FERRIE has a close friend

in Houstos, Texas whon he visits, but this individual is connected

in some capacity with bastein AlI Lines there and his exact identity

1s unknown. PIAZZA said he net many friends of FERRIE in Houstor

but it is his belies that they were all connacted with Bastern in

some capacity of enployneat.

He can recall no outside associates of

the subject in that area.

Referring to the incident on June 8, 1958, PIAZZA said he

believed that FERRIB was scheduled for a trip from New Orleans to

Houston and was to speak before some group in Houston that night

before continulng his flight to Brownsville, Texas, returning to

Houston and thence to Now Orleans. FERRIS asked PIAZZA to accompany

him on the trlp. PIAZZA said he mentioned the subject of tha cost and

the ticket whereupon FERRIE told hin that matter was already resolved

and not to worry. PIAZZA said he is of the impression now that

FERRIE showed him a ticket but it has been so long ago his mamory 1a

not clear on this point. They flew to Houston and PIAZZA said he

boarded the flight as a regular passenger. Once the plane was airborne,

FERRIE invited him to the pilot's compartment where he remained until

they reached Houston. They stayed at the hotel previously referred to

by PIAZZA but whose nane he cannot recall.. It is his recollection

that he was to stay in Houston while FERRIB made the run to Brownsville

and back to Houston.. He was then to join PERRIE fOI the return flight

to New Orleans, PIAZZA said he overslept and was awakened by FERRIB

calking him from the Houston airport to see why he was not at the

field.

FERRIB told hin he had to go on to New Orleans and stated he

had left a ticket for PIAZZA at the Bastern AlI Lines desk at the

terminal. PIAZZA said he had called there about the ticket and they

could not locate it. He returned to New Orleans and that is all he

recalls about the incident.

PIAZZA said his friendship continued with the subject until

about August, 1954. PIAZZA had graduated in Jupe of that year from

high school and was seeking employment. He stated that daring the

time he had first net FERRIB, the latter had helped him obtain his

commercial and instrument ratings. PIAZZA decided not to attend

college and FERRIB told hin of a job avallable in Wildwood, New

Jersey.: This job was with a non-scheduled airline. FERRIE told him

to contact RALPH COX with United States Overseas Airways and he did so.

PIAZZA fleW to Oklahona City, net COX and an aunt of COX; where the

three of them flew to wildwood, New Jersey. PIAZZA said he was hired

without any difficulty and he worked there from June until August,

1954, At that time he decided to return to New Orleans and attend

college.: For sona reason, his decision to do this tIritated FERRIE

and theis association and contact terminated. PIAZZA said he had no

argument with the subject nor was there any hostility fron the occasion.

He has only seen FERRIE on two or three brief occasions since that

time. PIAZZA entered the AlI POICe in 1955 and upon his honorable

discharge returned to New Orleans to attend Law. School.

PIZZA emphatically stated that during the entize time he was

closely associated with FITRIE he can never recall any occasion werein

the subjoct displayed any tendency toward any homosesuality or sext

deviation.

FERRIE never suggested or attempted any such relationship

with PIAZZA at any time during their acquaintance and he knows of no

one else with whon FERRIE night have attempted any such acts.

PIAZZA stated that during the two years or so he was iriendly

with the subject he spent a great deal of time with him.

Ha stated

this was of some concern to his parents at the time but that he had no

disagreements with then about the relationship other than the amount

of time he devoted to associating with flying and rolated activities.

He had no fanily crises with then other than the normal ones for a

youth of his age, and PIAZZA said these were brought on by himself

rather than at the suggestion or direction of FERRIB. FERRIE neveI

directly interfered with his parents in any matters but PIAZZA said

PERRIE is the type individual uno lancies hinself an espert in all

matters and, hence, balieves himself infallible. To this end,

FERRIE would express his 1deas in no uncertain tenas to anyone with

whom he disagreed. However, PIAZZA said that fERRIE had never done

this to the PIAZZAS.

FERRIE seened to have a certain talent

and background in the

use of psychology and would use this as vell as his philosophical

Ideas to influence some of the youths in the CAP Squadron.

PIAZZA

said he frequently disagreed with the subject and his bellers and that

FERRIE deeply resents critician.

FERRIE told PIAZZA he was attending Iulane University to obtain

his doctorate but PIAZZA stated he does not know it this is tus.

In discussion of his activities during the years of World War II.,

FERRIE gave the impression he was a flight instructor. He never

stated whether he was a member of the amed services or a civilian

instructor of just unich branch of the arned forces he taught.

Ins only close friend of FERRIE that PIAIZA could recall was

an individual by the name of JIM LEWALLIN, who is now working in

New Orleans but who was originally from Cleveland, Ohio.

PIAZZA MEt LENALLEN in 1954 when FERRIS was residing on Vinet

Street in Jefferson Parish. LIWALLEN was unemployed and had come to

New Orleans expressly to look up FERRIB. FERRIE helped obtain

employment fOr LEWALLEN at Eastern Air Lines in the baggage department.

LAWALLIN resided for some tina with FERkIE at the Vinet Street

address. PIAZZA said he does not know whether LEWALLEN is still

Exiendly with the subject or not. LEWALLEN is believed employed with

National Car Rentals at New Orleans International Aliport at the

present time.

The subject had several acquaintances in Alexandria, Loulsiana

through his activities with the Civil Air Patrol, according to PIAZZA,

but the identities of these persons are unknown.

PIAZZA knows of no other troubles in the past in wich the

subject was involved. He stated he was amazed when he read the

newspaper accounts of FERRIE's arrest.. PIAZZA was quite candid

during this interview and appeared to be truthíul in every respect.

He voiced some concern that he might become involved in this matter

as a result of his past association with the subject through flying

interests.

Because of his preparation for the practice of law he is

nost anxious to avoid any attention at all to any connection with

FERRIE, however innocent it was at the tine.

FROM :

RE :

JIM GARRISON

DISTRICT ATTORNEY

ANDREW J. SCIAMBRA

ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY

SPECIAL INVESTIGATION

AL LANDRY - INTERVIEW WITH

I talked to AL LANDRY at the New Orleans Athletic

Club in the presence of BOB LEMOINE, PERRY RUSSO, Jim Alcock,

Charlie Ward, and Lou Ivon (this was during your visit to Las

Vegas) :

AL. LANDRY told me that he first met DAVID FERRIE

in 1960.

He

said that he was in the C.A.P. in 1959 and 1960

and at that time he was around 15 years old.

LANDRY said that

FERRIE was sacond in command in the C.A.P. and a man namad

MORRELL was in command.

FERRIE at that time lived at 331

Atherton Drive, Matairie, Louisiana.

LANDRY stated that his

mother also lived in the house. LANDRY said that LAYTON MARTENS

used to stay there for 2 and 3

months at a time.

LANDRY said

that some of the people

in the squadron at that time were:

JOE PRATTINI

JOE HOWARD

CARL COSTA

SCOTT THANES

DONNIE RICHARDS

BUTCH MARSH

AL CHERAMIE

MIKE. CRUCHET

JOHNNY ESPENAN

PRICE

LAYTON MARTENS

JIM LANDRY (whose father was

a mechanic for Eastern

Airlines)

JOHNNY JOHNSTON

RODNEY WILLIAMS

LANDRY said that FERRIE hypnotized him twice that

he can remember.

He also said that FERRIE never did take him

out of the country, but he did leave home of his own accord

around 1960. LANDRY said he met FERRIE in the Balter Building

when he came

back in from out of town. LANDRY said he went

into the service in 1962 and was in the service until well

after the assassination.

He says he knows ARCACHA, but does

"not know JULIAN BUZNEDO.

BEFORE THE EASTERN AIP. LINES PILOTS

SYSTEM BOARD OF ADJUSTVENT

BRIEF OF EASTERN ATR LINES, INC., ON GRIEVANCE OF

DAVID W. FERRIE

EASTERN #15-63

EASTERN #29-63

EASTERN #48-63

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

On August 26, 1961, the Company learned through an article in the

New Orleans Times-Picayune that Ferrie had been arrested on charges of

committing a crime against nature and indecent acts with juvenile boys.

(Co. Ex. 55.) On August 29, after unsuccessful attempts to contact Ferrie,

the Company suspended him for an "indefinite period and until such time as

the charges against (Ferrie) are cleared." (Co. Ex. 56 and 57.) There

followed a series of attempts by the Company to obtain some explanation

from Ferrie in regard to those charges. (CO. Ex. 57, 58, 59, 60, 61.)

Finally, on October 19, 1961, Ferrie sent a letter to Captain Griener

based on

"reports of reputable detectives." The letter stated that:

".. . my problem has been traced with certainty to a highly placed local

official. We have positive evidence that this official is a Communist and

has been in charge of some highly important Communistic activities involving

the protection of Comnunists in the area." (Co. Ex. 62.)

Ferrie's status with Eastern was finalized in Captain Griener's letter

of September 6, 1961, to the effect that: "... the Company will be willing

to continue you on your present status until such time as a final determina-.

tion of these charges can be made. At that time a final decision as to your

future employment at Eastern will be made." (Co. Ex. 59.)

Some eleven criminal charges were eventually brought against Ferrie.

(Co. Ex. 20)

By letter of January 8, 1963, received by Eastern on January 10, 1963,

Mr. Gill informed the Company that the last of the criminal charges against

Ferrie had been Nolle Prosequied. (Co. Ex. 64.) Although a Nolle Prosequi

does not finally dispose of

a charge since it can be refiled without

prejudice, and even though

the action was not "final" as

contemplated in the

Griener letter, the Company elected to treat the criminal cases as finalized

and to proceed with its investigation, (The effect of a Nolle Prosequi will

• be discussed further in a later portion of the brief.

Ferrie, by letter of january 10, 1963, was directed to report to the

office of Captain Stone on January 17 to "discuss... the improprieties

which led to your suspension and to determine what future action the Company

will take in your case." (Co. Ex. 65.)

This meeting was delayed at Ferrie's request and, instead of attending

the meeting on January 17, he filed Grievance 15-63 on that date. This

grievance alleged that Eastern violated Ferrie's rights by not restoring

him to

flight status

as

of

January 9, 1963. It should be noted that the

Company's action suspending Ferrie in 1961 was never grieved.

Thus, all

the pending grievances

relate only to the action taken by the Company after

January 9, 1963. As requested by the Board, all pending grievances will be

covered in this brief.

The second date established for the Miami meeting was January 28, 1963.

This date was again postponed at the request of Ferrie or his representative

and the first step hearing in Grievance 15-63 was also postponed by agreement.

(Co. Ex. 66.)

On February 18, 1963, Grievance 29-63 was filed by Ferrie, alleging a

refusal to "air original Grievance in accordance with Section 30," refusal

to provide "pilot with written specifications of reasons why he is being

held out of service," an attempt to "compel Grievant to give testimony prior

to any scheduled Hearing," and "otherwise preventing him from exercising any

of his contractual rights, or complying with a Company request for an

'informal hearing.'"

Finally, on February 18, 1963, the meeting was held in Miami. (CO. Ex. 68%

At that meeting Ferrie positively refused to answer any questions concerning

the criminal charges which had been brought against him or any other matter

that had come to the attention of the Company. Ferrie was specifically

directed to answer these questions and was carefully warned that refusal to

answer would be considered grounds for disciplinary action. (Co. Ex. 68.)

On March 1, 1963, by letter from F. A. Stone, Vice President-Flight

Operations, Ferrie was discharged. (Co. Ex. l.) On that same date the

first step hearing in Grievance 15-63 was rescheduled for March

8, 1963.

(Co. Ex. 62.)

On March 11, 1963, Ferrie filed Grievance 48-63, which pertained to

his discharge.

Ferrie was then provided with a more extensive breakdown

of the items relied upon in discharging him. (Co. Ex. 2.)

REVIEW OF EVIDENCE ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY

The Board in considering this case should keep in mind the fact that

the main energies of the grievant were devoted to the suppression of the

pertinent facts about his behavior. The hearing was probably the most

technical in the long history of arbitrations under the Railway Labor Act

insofar as objections and rulings on profferred evidence. Time and time

again evidence was excluded which would normally be received as a matter

of course.

The grievant's efforts to suppress evidence and keep the Board in the

dark as to his activities were so successful that probably the majority of

the Company's evidence was excluded. However, in the long run, the efforts

of the grievant were unavailing, for evon the minor portion of the Company's

case which it succeeded in getting before the Board proved conclusively that

the charges brought by the Company were true and that the Company's actions

were justified.

Sergeant Fournier, the New Orleans police officer who conducted a major

portion of the investigation that led to the filing of the eleven criminal

charges, testified extensively concerning that investigation. His testinony

showed a normal, conscientious police investigation which started with a

routine investigation of the report that juvenile Alexander Landry had run

away from home.

The only non-routine aspect of the investigation was the fact that, at

every step of the police investigation of the runaway juvenile, evidence of

criminal activities on the part of Ferrie were uncovered. Thus, the

investigation grew in significance and the criminal charges against Ferrie

multiplied.

- 4-

## Page 341

A review of Sergeant Fournier's testimony leads one inescapably to the

conclusion that the criminal charges against Ferrie were not the result of

any sinister forces at work or the result of the activities of an outraged

mother.

The criminal charges resulted directly and solely from Ferrie's

nefarious activities.

There

can be no doubt that Ferrie was intimately connected with

Alexander Landry's runaway

from home.

It is even admitted that the first

time landry ran away he went directly to Ferrie. The second time he ran

away he did not return until his parents signed a statement agreeing not

to prosecute Ferrie. Again, this is admitted by Ferrie. (I547 - 548)

Nor can there be any doubt that Ferrie was intimately connected with

Al Cheramie's runaway from home. Sergeant Fournier testified as to Ferrie

visiting Cheramie in the youth detention center under the pretext of being

a doctor. The connection is also senfirned by the passport obtained for

Cheramie by Ferrie at approximately the time of the runaway.

The evidence

points directly to the fact that Ferrie assisted that child in running away

and that his visit to the child was for the purpose of insuring that he would

conceal the part played by Ferrie.

Sergeant Fournier's testimony supported the charges that Ferrie had

purported to be a medical doctor and his connection with the Holy Apostolic

Catholic Church of North America. Medical equipment, a priest's robe and a

chalice were found when Ferrie's house was searched.

Sergeant Fournier's testimony showed that the statements of the

juveniles involved as to Ferrie's sexual deviations were obtained freely

and voluntarily. While this type of thing is not easy for a boy to admit,

it must have been a great relief to them to get these matters off their

consciences. Certainly these are not the type of matters one makes up to

tell about oneself merely out of sympathy for the mother of a friend.

It should also be pointed out that the relatively brief

cross examination

of Sergeant Fournier did not reveal any inconsistencies in his testimony.

Nor did that cross examination reveal any hints of undue pressure brought to

bear on the Sergeant during his investigation.

Sergeant Fournier was

followed

on the stand by James Joseph Landry.

James Landry, who is

now 18, testified that he met Ferrie in August of 1960

at the New Orleans Airport. (I. 84, 85.) Landry was 16 at the time. The

meeting was the result of a discussion between Ferrie and Landry's father,

who was an Eastern Ramp Service Man. (I. 86.) Ferrie had inquired as to

whether or not James Landry would be interested in joining a Civil Air Patrol

Squadron known as the Metairie Falcon Squadron. (I. 85, 86.) On meeting

Ferrie, James Landry joined the squadron and was issued a membership card.

(Co. Ex. 3.)

landry's testimony as to his understanding of the status of this squadron

as an official part of the Civil Air Patrol was as follows:

"Well, for a long time we did not have a charter. Then, I

I guess it was over a year, he finally showed up with a charter

and said we were officially in the C.A.P."

Do "Who is 'he'?!l

A. "David Ferrie." (I. 88.)

Landry went on to describe parties at Ferrie's house during which Ferrie

supplied and served alcohol to the minors who were in the C.A.P.

(T. 89.)

Landry then testified as to having sexual relations with Ferrie on nights

that he stayed at Ferrie's home. (I. 98, 102.) The Board's special attention

is called to this witness' demeanor on the stand and the fact that vigorous

cross examination, in an attempt to show a motive for

the testimony, failed to

reveal any motive except that the testimony was true.

Landry's testimony had

the ring of truth, in contrast to the false notes struck by the witnesses for

the grievant.

-6 -

HH 51756 DocId: 32263970 Page 342

## Page 343

Landry was followed to the stand by Dr. Yaegar. Dr. Yaegar testified

concerning complaints received about Ferrie practicing medicine without a

license. (I. 142-143.) Ferrie was called in by Dr. Yaegar and warned against

such action. Whereupon, through a forty minute interview, Ferrie spun a

fantastic web of lies about his background and activities. (Note particularly

the testimony about Ferrie claiming to have several Ph.D's at page 144 and

compare with Irion's

testimony on the same subject.) Unfortunately for

Ferrie, Dr. Yaegar was in a position to check many of these statements and

found them to be completely false. (I. 144-145.)

Dr. Yaegar's testimony in regard to the complaints received should be

considered in connection with Company Exhibit 4 (which shows that Ferrie had

himself listed in the telephone directory as Dr.) with Sergeant Fournier's

testimony in regard to the medical instruments found in Ferrie's home and with

the testimony of Irion, a witness called by Ferrie, who testified that Ferrie

often treated him for various sicknesses,

The next witness on behalf of the Company was John Roger Espenan.

Mr. Espenan's son had been a member of Ferrie's unauthorized C.A.P. Metairie

Falcon Squadron. Mr. Espenan testified as to having become suspicious of the

squadron's authenticity, of Ferrie's statements that it was an authorized

squadron, and of his obtaining the forged certificate and taking it to the

Air Force C.A.P. sergeant who confirmed his suspicion of its being invalid.

(I. 285-295.) He, Espenan, also testified that the supposed certificate

was on a form used for C.A.P. Certificates. (I. 305, 314)

After Mr. Espenan's

testimony there could be no

doubt that Ferrie

organized a bogus C.A.P. squadron and deceived the parents and the members

as to its status. To quiet the questions about its

status, he forged a

C.A.P. Certificate. Mr. Espenan's testimony was,

of course, completely

## Page 344

confirmed by the records of the C.A.P, and, particularly, the sergeant's

Memo to File regarding Espenan's visit to the headquarters with the forged

certificate. (Co. Ex. 54.)

The Board should particularly note the representations of Mr. Gill

and Ferrie that appear on pages 302-304 of the transcript. Both gentlemen

assured. the Board there was a state charter, which was

obtained in 1961 and

which would be introduced in evidence by them. These representations proved

to be completely false, as no such document was ever tendered by them.

There was no

state charter issued until 1962, long after Ferrie's arrest

and the breakup of the squadron. Moreover, they knew that they could not

produce any charter issued in 1961. The Company did produce the only state

charter issued; it was issued in 1962, and it was signed by Ferrie.

(AIPA Ex. 23; I. 516, 517.)

This attempt to mislead the Board was typical of the grievant's case

from beginning to end. of ta: Wife andy paranoris; the degannels

The next witness for the Company was Ronald Hubner. Three exhibits

(Co. Ex. 6, 7 and 8) were introduced during his testimony. The first exhibit

was a letter from the American Vice Consul in Italy and it exploded completely

Ferrie's contention that he had a Ph.D. from Pheonix University in Bari, Italy.

(Co. Ex. 6.) The second exhibit was the minutes of the New Orleans Chapter

of the Military Order of World Wars meeting of July 24, 1961, at which Ferrie

made a speech which inflamed the membership. This record of the meeting

shows that Ferrie was indulging in these activities as an Eastern Air Linest:

Captain, not as a private individual, "(Co. Ex. 70) bar: 300/ cold eat

The third exhibit was a letter from Colonel Christiansen of the sace

U. S. Air Force detailing some öf the difficulties Ferrie got into in the

C.A.P. during the period he was a legitimate member. (Co. Ex. 8.)

## Page 345

The remainder of the Company's case consisted

of a series of exhibits.

Exhibits 44 through 54 were records of the Civil Air Patrol regarding Ferrie.

They showed that from 1955 to 1959 Ferrie was out of the Civil Air Patrol.

Apparently he was

put out in 1955 against his wishes, and it took him

approximately one year, starting in 1958, to obtain permission to return.

(Co. Ex. 44 and 47.)

He was in the Civil Air Patrol from approximately

September 1959 until June of 1960, when he was again forced out because of

his misbehavior.

Company Exhibit 48 shows that he used his claim to have a Ph.De in

gaining readmission to the Civil Air Patrol. Company Exhibits 51-54 show

that it was generally believed in New Orleans that Ferrie had an authorized

squadron in 1961, and these misrepresentations had reached the point that

the Civil Air Patrol was considering staining newspaper coverage of their

denials of any connection with Ferrie,

Exhibits 72 and 73 were rebuttal exhibits to Ferrie's testimony regarding

Italian universities. They show the actual methods of accredidation, the

requirements for attendance of foreign students, the degrees awarded, and

that Phoenix University is not a recognized Italian university. These

exhibits should be compared with Ferrie's testimony on this subject. The

result is that Ferrie's testimony regarding the Italian system of higher

learning (molded by him to fit his clained alma mater) is completely refuted

by the impartial documentary exhibits introduced by the Company.

Other Company exhibits were Ferrie's application for employment

(Co. Ex. 9) and the physical record he filled out when applying for employment

(Co. Ex. 10) Most

of the Company's testimony (showing that many facts were

concealed by Ferrie in making

out these forms) was excluded. However, Ferrie

testified about these

matters, and his testimony alone convicts him of

_9-

DocId:32263970

Page 345

## Page 346

omitting many derogatory items. His explanation for not listing his total

educational and employment record is certainly amazing, but hardly persuasive.

The health records introduced by Ferrie himself show mental and physical

problems which should have been revealed to the Company; especially the record

of the Cleveland Clinic, which was introduced after a demand for its

production by the Company. (ALPA Ex. L.) Mr. Gill explained this medical

report as being due to Ferrie's "tender age" at the time. (I. 487.) At

the time, Ferrie's "tender age" was 26?

REVIEW OF TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF GRIEVANT

It would be a kindness to Ferrie if the Board simply ignores all the

testimony introduced on his behalf. Unfortunately for Ferrie, the Board

must consider the entire record. It is submitted that the grievant's side

of the case, standing alone, is suificient to justify the Board in upholding

the discharge.

Ferrie, on the stand, testified that everyone knew his squadron was not

part of the Civil Air Patrol, and that early in 1961 he had obtained a state

charter for a non-profit corporation. (I. 515-516.)

An unsworn, unsigned "deposition" in absentia of Martens was offered

as an exhibit at this time by ferrie to support his testimony. (ALPA Ex. 240)

According to Mr. Gill, this "deposition" was based on a letter written by

Mr. Martens. Mysteriously, Martens had not had an opportunity to sign it.

The "deposition" stated that a charter for a non-profit corporation was

obtained in early 1961 and was kept at Ferrie's house. The "deposition" went

on to state that this was the document Mr. Espenan and the sergeant of the

Civil Air Patrol examined.

DocId: 32263970

## Page 347

Unfortunately, this explanation was doomed to fall apart practically

before it was offered for, to assist the Board, the Company at this point

produced a copy of the only

state charter for

a non-profit

corporation

obtained by Ferrie., This charter was applied for in 1962 — not 1961.

The date is, of course, long after Ferrie's arrest, and even longer after

Mr. Espenan had checked the forged C.A.P. Charter. Moveover, the 1962

document was signed by Ferrie, which establishes beyond question his knowledge

that no previous charter existed. Of course, this 1962 charter also exploded

the unsworn, unsigned "deposition" in absentia of Martens. Indeed, when it

was pointed out that the "deposition" contained parenthetical portions

indicating that Martens was being handed various documents for inspection

while his "deposition" was in progress, Mr. Gill found it necessary to

explain further that the "deposition" was not alone based upon a letter from

Martens after all, but was also based upon a personal interview in his office -

sort of a mixture of the two.

Ferzie's story changed rapidly. He next claimed that, despite

being the leader of the squadron, he did not check details such as a charter.

That was the responsibility of the young boys in the squadron. He ignored

completely the fact that when he signed the 1962 charter he had to know

there was no previous charter in that name, and that when he introduced the

- Martens "deposition," he knew the facts stated therein were untrue.

Ferrie proceeded with testimony to the effect that the landry accusation

originally related to April 26, 1961.

He testified

about visiting one

Prinz, an Eastern crew scheduler, and obtaining absolute proof that he was

not in New Orleans on April 26.

The information supposedly obtained fron

Prinz was to the effect that Ferrie was

on a flight as shown by flight records.

(T. 596, 597, 601, 602) Ferrie then implied that the District Attorney was

tipped off to this proof and the date on the indictment was changed to

April 28, 1961.

-11 -

HH 54756

DocId: 32263970

Page 347

---

## Page 348

On cross-examination he first refused to answer any questions about

the proof obtained from Prinz. (I. 618-620.) He then became vague and

could not remember what the proof was or whether the proof regarding

April 26 was even obtained from Prinz. (T. 621, 626, 628, 629.) This

initial refusal to testify and the

subsequent vagueness is understandable

in view

of

the

proof offered by the Company in the form of pay records

showing he was

on vacation the last half of April, 1961. (Co. Ex. 71.)

Ferrie's other testinony was as wild and unconvincing as the first two

instances noted. First, he had a good, solid Ph.D. Then, after cross-

examination, on redirect by his attorney, he took the position that, regardless

of its validity, he felt he had benefited by obtaining it. (I. 706.) Of

course, the Board should not forget his testimony that he obtained this Ph.D.

to impress Harvard professors with his ability in the area of air safety.

Also noteworthy was his testimony that he listed himself in the telephone

book as "Dr." for the same purpose. Ferrie left to the Board's imagination

how the Harvard professors were going to be impressed by his listing in the

New Orleans telephone book.

It would serve no useful purpose, and space scarcely permits a discussion

of all the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Ferrie's testimony. One other

aspect of his testimony is so important that it must be touched upon. Ferrie

had some eleven criminal charges brought against him. On direct examination

he did not attempt any detailed explanation of why this should happen to him

other than implications that it was done by Mrs. Landry. (He had previously

explained in a letter to Captain Griener that it had all happened because he

was hot on the trail of Communists, some of whom worked for Eastern.)

On cross-examination he was offered the

chance to explain. A long

statement was made that, based on investigations by private detectives, it

could be shown that his

troubles with the law were

due to Communists and

-12 -

HH 54756 DooId:32263970

Page 348

## Page 349

Mrs. Landry. (I. 676-684.) However, when details were requested, it became

apparent that there was no evidence to support the explanation.. A District

Attorney was supposed to be the key figure; however, Ferrie testified this

District Attorney refused to have anything to do with the charges and

the

majority of the charges were actually brought

in an entirely different parish.

(I. 679, 682, 683.) No connection was shown between this District Attorney

and Mrs. Landry and the individuals who signed statements.

The net result of Ferrie's testimony on this subject was that he had no

explanation at all. Thus, Sergeant Fournier's testimony, such as he was

allowed to give, involving his normal, impartial police investigation stands

completely unrefuted.

The other witnesses called by Ferrie contributed more to the Company's

case than to Ferrie's case. Irion's testimony on cross-examination was about

the most damaging testimony to Ferrie presented during the hearings. He

stated that, during 1955 through 1960, Ferrie participated in C.A.P. meetings

and wore a Captain's uniform. (I. 765, 766.) Of course, the previously-

introduced C.A.P. documents proved conclusively that Ferrie was not an

official member of the C.A.P. during most of this period. (Co. Ex. 44 and 47.)

Irion also testified that it was unlawful to wear this uniform unless you were

an official member of the C.A.P. (I. 766.) His prejudice was shown by his

testimony that his opinion of Ferrie would not be changed even it it were

proven to him that Ferrie was not a member of the C.A.P. and was not

authorized to wear a uniform during most of the 1955-1960 period. (I. 768.)

Despite approximately a hali-hour of leading questions and prompting by

grievant's attorney on redirect,

Irion stuck to his story about Ferrie!s

wearing the C.A.P. uniform during periods when he, by his own admission,

was not

a member of the C.A.P. (I. 783-789.)

DocId: 32263970

His other testimony directly supported the position of the Company, and

was directly contrary to Ferrie's testimony®

He testified that Ferrie had

medical instruments in his home prior to his mother's coming to live with

him (Ferrie had testified

that they were only for his mother); that Ferrie

had three college degrees; that Ferrie was supposedly studying to be a medical

doctor; that Ferrie hypnotized some of the boys; and that Ferrie had a chalice

at his home. (I. 775, 778, 779, 780, 781)

Tewallen! testimony on behalf of Ferrie was totally unpersuasive.

Apparently, the main purpose of calling Lewallen was to support Ferrie's

account of how he filled out his inaccurate employment application form in

Cleveland just before being hired by Eastern. Since Lewallen was in the

Air Force at the time (many miles away in the

Carolinas), he explained his

presence in Cleveland by testimony that his superior had given him three or

four days off in the middle of the week. (T. 816, 817.) According to

Lewallen, he was not on leave or on a pass; he just was given some time off,

and just happened to be in Cleveland and looking over Ferrie's shoulder at

the time the form was filled in and signed as true.

He remembered the exact

details vividly.

Lewallen also confirmed Irion's testimony about Ferrie's participating

in the Civil Air Patrol during 1955-1960, although, under extensive prompting,

he later changed his testimony (I. 807-808) and attempted to

come in line

with the story Ferrie had previously given.

When Vr. Bannister took the stand, the Board was treated to the rare

experience of having

one attorney for the grievant elicit testimony while the

other

attorney for the grievant objected to the testimony and had it stricken.

About the only conclusion that could be drawn from Mr. Bannister's testimony

was that he had interviewed Ferrie's friends and his friends had spoken well

of him. From all indications, he interviewed only people whose names Ferrie

had supplied. (T. 856-857)

- 14 -

HH 54756

DocId: 32263970

Page 350

---

## Page 351

Mr. Bannister testified about his investigation

of Ferrie's speech

before the veterans' organization in the role of an Eastern Captain. Ferrie

must have spoken before that organization twice and had both speeches stopped,

either that or Mc. Bannister's investigation was woefully inadequate, for he

testified as to Ferrie's attacking the then-President Eisenhower.

(I. 842, 858.) The Company's evidence all related to a speech attacking

President Kennedy.

DISCUSSION

It would seem obvious that the evidence introduced on behalf of the

Company or the evidence introduced on behalf of the grievant, either or both,

establishes beyond any doubt that the Company's discharge of Ferrie was

justified. The only real defense set forth on behalf of the grievant was

that he is smart enough to stay out of jail; so he is certainly good enough

to be an Eastern captain. Truly, this is an amazing defense. One might

expect to hear it offered in defense of a janitor, but it grates on the

sensibilities to hear it offered on behalf of an Eastern captain.

An Eastern captain holds a highly-paid, highly-respected, highly-

responsible position. He is responsible for the lives of thousands of

passengers and millions on millions of dollars

of equipment during the

course of a year. If Eastern is to secure passenger revenue with which

to pay its thousands of employees, its pilot group must retain the respect

and trust of the traveling public.

The general public is in no position to judge the flying ability of

a pilot; it makes its judgments on the appearance and general reputation

of an airline's pilot personnel. One does not lightly put one's life in

the hands of another, and certainly not in the hands of a man like Ferrie.

- 15 -

## Page 352

The Air Line Pilots Association has long been in accord with these

principles. It has worked for years to create a professional status for

the airline pilot. Each base has its Professional Standards Committee,

which is interested in far more than just a pilot's flying ability.

Neither the Company nor the ALPA would ever be satisfied to have a

standard set at the level necessary for the Board to find in favor of

Ferrie. Contrary to Ferrie's contention, one has not proven that his

behavior meets the standards for an airline captain by merely proving one

has not been sentenced to jail.

During the course of the hearing, there were many discussions on the

effect of a case being Nolle Prosequied. Ferrie would have the Board believe

that in some way this completely clears his record; that it is, in effect,

a finding of not guilty. Actually, it anounts to nothing more than a decision

by the District Attorney not to proceed at that time.

This is spelled out

in Title 15 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, Section 15:328, which reads:

"A nolle prosequi simply discharges a particular indictment

or part thereof,

and is no bar to a subsequent prosecution for

the offense as to which the nolle prosequi was entered."

Thus, if the statute of limitations (a procedural rule having nothing

to do with whether or not a person is guilty of

a charge) has not run, ten

of the original cases could be refiled in louisiana in the future. Certainly,

in such circumstances, the entry of a nolle prosequi is no bar to this

Board's looking into the actions of Ferrie.

Ferrie blandly took the position that the not guilty verdict in the

criminal case relating to James Landry prohibited this Board from considering

any of his activities in connection with landry.

This is not even the rule

in connection with courts of law - let alone action by an administrative

board under the Railway Labor Act.

As Professor Prosser in Ihe Law of Torts, 2nd Ed., 1955, p. 7, points

out:

"The same act may be both a crime against the state and a

tort against an individual.

In such a

case, since the interests

invaded are not the same, and the objects to be accomplished by

the two suits are different, there may be both a civil tort

action and a criminal prosecution for the same offense.

may be conducted successively, or at the same time, and a decision

for or against the defendant in one is not conclusive as

Perhaps the most common example of this is in automobile accident cases.

Individual A may be criminally charged with speeding which caused an accident

which injured B. If A is found not guilty of speeding in the criminal case,

the jury in a later civil action for damages may still find that A was

speeding and award damages to B. Indeed, it would be reversible error to

permit the jury in the civil action to be told that A had been found not

guilty of speeding in the criminal case, as they must be left free to decide

the issue for themselves.

This same theory carries over to the instant case. In the criminal case

involving Ferrie, the interest of the state was involved. The issue was

whether or not Ferrie had violated a state statute on the date set forth in

the charges. In this case the interest of Eastern is involved. This Board

is concerned with the question of whether or not Ferrie's conduct was such

that Eastern had the right to discharge him.

The decision by Judge Jason Berkman, sitting as neutral with the

Mechanical System Board of Adjustment in the Clements

case, is direct

authority for the

proposition that Eastern may discharge an employee for

the same behavior upon which the employee has successfully defended himself

on a criminal

charge. (Co. Ex. 70.) There is no distinction between the

Clements case

and the Ferrie case on this question.

It has been

settled law for some thirteen years that only a System

Board of Adjustment may decide an issue involving reinstatement and back pay.

The leading cases establishing that principle, and holding that only Adjustment

Boards under the Railway Labor Act have jurisdiction of such disputes, are

SZocum V. Delaware, Lo & Wo Role, 339 U. S. 239 (1950) and Railway Conductors

V. Southern Railway, 339 U. S. 255 (1950). Ihose Supreme Court decisions

extended the doctrine announced in Railway Conductors v. Pitner, 326 U. S. 561

(1946) to the effect that the administrative agency created under the Railway

Labor Act to decide such matters of contract interpretation and application

should be given primary

jurisdiction of such matters.

In the Slocum case, which involved

interpretation of collective agreements

with respect to job assignments and back pay, the Court concluded: "We hold

that the jurisdiction of the Board to adjust grievances and disputes of this

type is exclusive, "

The doctrine of the Slocum case has been followed in many cases, including

cases involving airline adjustment boards. See, for example, Woolley vo

Eastern Air Lines, 250 F. 2d 87 (5th Cir. 1957); Hettenbaugh v. Airline Pilote

Association, 189 F. 2d 319 (5th Cir. 1951); Crusen v. United Air Lines,

239 F. 2d 863 (10th Cir, 1956); Colbert v. Railroad Trainmen, 206 F. 2d 9

(9th Cir. 1953); Railroad Telegraphers v. New Orleans, I. & Mo Ryo, 156 F.

2d 1 (8th Cir, 1946); Spires v. Southern Ry., 204 F. 2& 453 (4th Cir. 1953);

Starke V. New York, C. & St. In R. Ro, 180 F 2d 569 (7th Cir, 1950).

Thus, no court, whether state or federal, criminal or civil, has the right

to determine the issue presented to this System Board as to whether or not

-"Ferrie is entitled to reinstatement and back pay. This System Board should

and must make its own independent decision on the record before it.

One of the Company grounds

for the discharge was that

Ferrie refused

to cooperate when

the Company was conducting its investigation in January

of 1963 to determine what action, if any, the Company should take, The

transcript of that hearing (Co. Ex. 68), wherein Ferrie refused to answer

even simple preliminary questions, is clear proof of the charge. No defense

whatsoever was offered by the grievant on this point, justifying the Company

action on this ground alone.

Ferrie took the position that the Company had no right to require him to

cooperate in that investigation.

In making this contention he relies on

Section 29-A-(4) of the Agreement. According to Ferrie, the Company must

first take some action and then, at the first step hearing, he could be

required, for the first time, to offer some explanation or be required to

cooperate with the Company's investigation.

A brief example in another contest should be sufficient to show the

absurdity of this contention. An aircraft may be severely damaged in a

landing and at least three possibilities exist (there are, of course, others)

as to the Captain's responsibility: (1) The Captain was a hero who saved

the lives of the passengers. (2) The Captain was caught in unusual

circumstances and neither contributed to the accident nor could he prevent it.

(3) The Captain was careless and caused the accident. According to Ferrie's

contention, in order to get the Captain's side of the story in order to

determine whether he was a hero, or a victim of circumstances or careless,

the Company must first discharge him and then discuss the matter with him

at the first step hearing.

Of course, Ferrie's interpretation is absurd.

The Company has an

absolute right to investigate and question an employee about things that

might affect his employee status. The employee must cooperate or lose his

employment. As every individual realizes, when you take a job you must give

- 19 -

HH 54756

DocId: 32263970

Page 355

---

## Page 356

up a portion of your right of privacy or face the consequence of being

discharged.

This is the effect of the decision of Judge Kehoe in the

O'Neill case. (Co. Ex. 69.)

Ferrie, in his defense, relies on the Callaway decision of this System

Board of Adjustment. Ferrie interprets that decision as holding that,

regardless of his activities off the job, he cannot be discharged unless he

commits some wrongful act on the job.

There are many distinctions between the Ferrie case and the Callaway case.

The Callaway case involved only a single incident between two employees, known

to only one or two individuals who were not Eastern employees.

The Ferrie case involves practically a man's entire life history and

actions known to virtually a multitude of potential Eastern customers.

Certainly all the people in the New Crleans area with knowledge of Ferrie's

activities must have a distorted imprassion of Eastern's pilot personnel.

Can one conceive of the Espenans, the Taegars, the Landrys, or anyone

knowing even a portion of

the story patronizing Eastern, if they felt they

might have Ferrie as their captain on the flight?

Ferrie's relationship with his fellow employees must also be considered.

Could the pilot group at New Orleans feel any pride at being an Eastern pilot

if the standards for that position are so low as to include Ferrie? What

would be the reaction of newly hired copilots or flight attendants who would

have to work with and associate with Ferrie on flights? Would they have the

respect for him that must be given to the captain if flights are to operate

efficiently and safely? Indeed, would families in the New Orleans area permit

their daughters

to become Eastern flight attendants, knowing

that they might

well have to work with Ferrie?

The imagination boggles at the thought of the

letter

a new flight

attendant might write home. "Dear Mom: I have just had

my first flight and have met my first Eastern captain. His name is Captain

Ferrie, and he has had a most interesting background and past ..."

- 20 -

HH 54756 DocId:32263970

Page 356

---

## Page 357

Of course,

the most interesting letter would be the one "Dear Mom" would

fire off

to Mr. MacIntyre, explaining just why she had ordered her daughter

home.

Merely to pose the above questions is to supply the answers as to the

reasons why Ferrie's conduct requires the termination of his services with

Eastern.

The above discussion relates primarily to Grievance 48-63, the discharge

grievance. Grievance 15-63 was filed on January 17, 1963 and it alleged that

Eastern had violated Ferrie's rights by not restoring him to flight status as

of January 9, 1963. It should be noted that this grievance was filed on the

very date that Ferrie was originally scheduled to appear in Miami

to supply

information

to the Company regarding the charges of unlawful acts and other

improprieties. It is submitted that the primary and only purpose in filing

this grievance was to attempt to supply some sort of legitimate basis for

Ferrie's refusal to cooperate with the Company.

In any event, the Company had told Ferrie, by letter of September 6, 1961,

that it intended to wait until after the criminal charges were acted upon in

a final manner before deciding what action it should take. (Co. Ex. 59.)

Thus, he had written notice in 1961 that his suspension would continue after

the criminal charges were acted upon and until the final company action

should

be decided upon. His time limit started running in 1961, if he thought this

procedure was unfair.

When the Company received notice on January 10, 1963 that all the

criminal charges were at least temporarily out of court, it acted that same

day to set in motion the machinery for reaching a final decision.

(Co. Exo 65:) All delays thereafter ivere solely due to Ferrie.

Grievance 29-63 was filed by Ferrie on February 18, 1963, alleging four

grounds of complaint. The first was a refusal to "air original Grievance in

- 21 -

HH 54756

DocId: 32263970

Page 357

---

## Page 358

accordance with Section 30." This apparently relates to the postponement of

the first step hearing in Grievance 15-63. However, this postponement was

agreed to by counsel for Eastern and Ferrie. (Co. Ex. 66.) The second ground

was refusal to provide "pilot with written specifications of reasons why he

is being held out of service." Ferrie had actually been told in writing twice

why he was suspended. (Co. Ex. 56, 57, 59.)

The third ground was an attempt to "compel Grievant to give testimony

prior to any scheduled Hearing." This apparently refers to the Company attempt

to have Ferrie come to Miami to offer any explanation he should choose to give

concerning the charges and allegations which had been made against him in

New Orleans. This ground, as already shown in this brief, is also without

merit.

The fourth ground was "othemise preventing him from exercising any of

his contractual rights, or complying with a Company request for an 'informal

hearing. ''' This charge was so vague the Company has no idea what it refers to.

In any event, both Grievance 15-63 and 29-63 could only call for a

monetary award, During the hearing, Mr. Gill, on behalf of Ferrie, waived all

nonetary damages and thus, in effect, waived Grievances 15-63 and 29-63.

(I. 210.)

CONCLUSION

On the evidence introduced at the hearings, the Board should and must

find that Grievances 15-63, 29-63 and 48-63 must be denied.

Respectfully submitted,

William G. Bell, JI.

a male in New Orleans regarding the handling of guns, use of tennia

shoes and rope and the apparent takeoff of an airplane aftar the

moon went donn.. Ferrie was transferred here temporarily fron New

Orleans and is staying at the Travelers Hotel, across the street

from the old bAl terminal.

After a 26 hour survedllance and background investigation, langford

acts of wrongdoing The Custons Agent Investigators learned later

In the investigation that Ferrle, who is a scout leader, had been

Erjing to pronote transportation to south america with the Alr

shoes and rope was in reference to a proposed hike at the termination

of their proposed flight.

you broke your word, your trust lst and shot me out of the saddle-

You obviously thought more of the possible money you'd

1 Guatemalan Information says that the proposal of citizenship was

rejected by Carlos

for polltical reasons.

Date unknown.

2

Information from here indicates that Noll was hard up for money

(a) he charges the October 6 trio

b) for the Octobar 20 trip he: takes the ticket money from

Helms

"ropst, et al and pockets it and then charges

c) he is borrowing money, going intö debt etc AFTER Oct 31

In the period October 2e-31, Noll could NOT have talked or communic

with Carlos,

or given him a birth certificate because Carlos was

in hiding

9 2127214

There could

certificate to easies Do coer 20-20,

or presentation of this

because Carl Noll

is in

uatemala

5

The ONLY remaining period in which there could have been any

contact between Noll and Carlos is the period October 13-20

wheniNoll is in the States

6

Now

Rolling says the Birth Record was shown him October Xe 13

on the airplane retunning to the States.

7. Therefore any conversation between Carlos and Noll,

showing of any certificae had to be in the period October 13-20

8. BUT from the foreoing (# and #2 above) it is obvious that

no deal is consummated because Noll received and had no money.

THEREFORE the circumstances prove the if a conspiracy did exist

Carlos must have taken an effective action to stop it

NOTE: Information suggests that someone BESIDES Noll and Carlos

knew about this rejection in the period October 13-20.

NOW. Joe Marcello knows by 11:00 A.M. New Orleans time that

there is a stay of deportation granted in Washington. If there

was a conspiracy it certianly was abandoned at that

time. There is

NO OVERT ACt to complete the coppiracy.

There is NO presenting

by the parties concerned of this certificate to the Italian

Consull.

I've become sore concerned, not having heard irom you or any

answer to my last letter of about threa pecks ago. Is every-

thing 0.K?

Am in Elberton at the above address. Have located a nice little

I thint the location is going to be perfect.

Harl the telephone installed today, number is (Area 404) 283-5022.

My mother mother will be living with me... and I contemplate be-

ing in this house at least until spring. I hope, by then, that

things are arranged - spiritually and finencially -- so that me

can make a down payment on the large property and move there.

Do send me a note... let me know that you are O.ko, or thatever

the score might be.

Father,

Needloss to say, I am more concerned and norried.

It has been

so long since word has coue from you; are you in the depths,

are you sick....or what 1s the problen ?

11lness, trgubles iith

o set my

mind at ease.

As you can see from the address, I hate left Atlenta, and au

in Elberton for a short period before going on to Andersar,

S.C.

In Anderson I will be Personnel Director for the local

hospital ( not Church affiliated, thank God ), but until I en

able to locate just the right place, mill live in Elberton. I

mant to take this move slon and easy... since me can not afford

to continue moving around and must carefully select our Canter

and once selected.... build and remain.

I feel Anderson affords many excellent opportunities for our

work. First of all, it is a medium size tom.... and in Just a

fen minutes one can be In the seculded country... also in just

45 minutes to Greenville... two hours to Atlanta, etc. Too, and

consistent with our rocation, it is in the heart of the textile

rorld offering all sorts of

jobs.......ordinary jobs among

ordinary neople.

I hope that it will be in this

area where ne

can finally establish our "nonastery" -- either in tom or on

the outskirts -- there a consunity life can be enjoyed, and

yot, nhere all whose rocation calls for it, can dally go into

secular nork.

But at this very present moment, the main thing is to get started

on the new job so there mill be a steady income..

•. and to build

from there.

I have had several letters fron John Nott. He, like myself, 1s

concerned that he has not heard from you. You made a most

majestic inpression on him ...

Dear Sir:

With reference to our telephone conversation, I am sending you a copy

of some pages from a booklet sent to me in 1950 by Carmel Henry

Carfora of the North American Old Roman Catholic Church.

This

lists the succession of bishops since the early seventeenth century by

which Carfora claimed valid orders, information about Berghes, and

the rites and ceremonies of his Church.

This seems to indicate that

the ritual by. which he was ordained was in Latin, although this is not

definitely stated.

You will note the statement the

"conforms

strictly to the prescriptions of the Pontificale, Missale, and Ritual

Romanum. "

The Yearbook of American Churches lists as the present Metropolitan

Primate of the body the Most Rev. Cyrus Starkey, 32 East 3rd Street,

Moorestown, New Jersey, and the Chancellor as

the Most Rev. John

E. Schweikert, 3153 West 6lst Street, Chicago,

Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Encyclopedia

Britannica, and Catholic Encyclopedia add nothing of significance,

but

my set of the last named is the 1911 edition and there may be a later.

This whole Old Catholic movement in this country is interesting,

especially the activity of Villatte, but I do not think it has any significance.

Villatte scattered his orders all over the place and I visited some of

his Negro bishops in Harlem several years ago.

Please call on me if I can serve you further.

Fategnally yours,

timeters

Attidue of Mike Crouchet toward & ptain Ferrie during 1961, can

be best described as Captain FErrie being in Mike's way. Here

is the reason. First Mike was not part of the indépendent

squadron Captain Ferrie had. He resented this. Second, Captain

Ferrie had

a bad experience with Mike when he was trying to

tutor Mike in mathematics and English.

Mrs. Landryh called Mike and asked him to talk with her about

"throw a scare into Captain Ferrie"

sadd she was going to call the police and have them

scare him.

She wanted Mike's help. Mike was not too keen on this idea.

Mrs. Landry said there would be no real involvement.

She & just

wanted a little hepp from Mike and to have

Mike talk to the

police. Mike tentatively agreed.

then, on a Monday, Mrs. Landry. calle

Mike and said some police

would come and see Mike where he worked at Puglia's food stoore.

She said she had provided them with some information. She said

all Mike would have to do is agree that the information was

correct.

Mike had some doubts about this and called his father.

His father said to leave it strictly alone. However, a little

later the police walked into the store to

talk. Mike

the police he wanted to talk bo

his father first. authen told

police said they would come by his house at 8:00 A.M. the

That night Mike talked to his father. His father said he

wanted to talk to the policemen himself.

At 7:00 A.M. the next morning the policeman, Fournier and

Jonau came

to the door. Mike answered the door. He told

the police his father wanted to

talk to them. They said

never mind they would talk to the father later. Then Mike was

carted off to the East Bank jail. There they let him sit for a lo

time worrying. Then they called him in to an office.

They had

a typewritten paper and started talking from that. Mike said

to anything they wanted provided they were not

going to hold him or areest him or make any trable for him.

They said ok. just sign

the paper and you can go. Mike signed

and left. He was told that would be the end to the whole matter.

It No Nepister Landy

In January 1962 Mike suddenly realized that there was no end

to the

so he sent Landry and Crouchet home. A few days later he

picked them up again.

the boys what dates they

would have to testify to and let them go.

Then came the first: trial. Ferrie was found Not Guilty, Mrs.

Landry immediately called a meeting of Landry

and Mike

that everybody wojld have to act fast now. It looked to

her as though Ferrie was about to bereinstated. In that case he

would get his back pay and then be able to sue

everybody and take

away their cars, houses and everything. So she said everyboyd would

have to agree to stick together and prevent him from getting his

job back.

So everyboyd agreed that we would have to protect

themselves.

Mike then left for service still worrying abouta a lawsuit.

A Mr. Scheuering came to see him while in camp in Arkansas.

He asked Mike if he would withdraw the charges. Mike pad said

he could not. He felt if he did withdraw them that Furnier

and finally

Then he was transferred to Georgia. While there a Mr. Brownlee

came to see him. Again Mike declined to do anything fearing the

police, Mrs. Landry

and Captain Ferrie. After Brownlee left

he telephoned his father who telephoned Thalheim.

Since this

conversation was unsatisfactory the father advised that Mike

could do wlatever he plas

Then Mike told his story to an officer

who said that the cops

could not get him for perjury since he

had signed no affidavit. He doub ed Captain Ferrie would sue.

He felt the best thing was to come forward and tell the story.

On returning to New Orleans in September 1962 Mrs. Landry

advised him to stick to his guns otherwise everybody would

be sued and lose their homes. Mike thought differenyl and went

to the District Attorney and

told his

story. On the strength

of that the charges were dismissed.

Then Mike tried to tell the straight story to Eastern Air Lines

in the persons of George Grienr,. Bill Bell and Don Landry.

They did not listen and would not listen.

Later he was approached by someone reprenting themselves

as agents of Eastern Air Lines offering help in getting a job

and other é benefits if he would stick to his original

story

and try to hang captain Ferrie. He was told it would go hard

with him if he @ continue

to exoneerate Captain F rrie:

He was also told that he was liable to a lawsuit if he told the

truth and as a result Captain Ferrie were exonerated.

Dear Bishop Hyde,

It was nice to talk to you again by

telephone. However, I was again distressed to

learn of

your health condition. I do wish that you would take care

of yourself. Of course, the strain of what our mutual

acquaintance is doing is aggravating enough in iteelf

without the added burden of 111 health. I shall continue

to remebber you in all my prayers that you speedily

recover.

As I indicated to you, several telephone

calls have been received in New

Orleans. Primarily; in

so faras I can learn, these calls were directed to

Mr. Banister or to Mr. Gill. There may have been calls

to others. I do not know. Would you know anything on this

As I told you Mr. Banister telephoned

Commission for Chicago. Mr. Peterson had received a visit

our friend and a

Fr. Mario Vites, Vieties,

or veritas.

This priest was supposed to be rector

of st. Hilary's in

philadelphia. However, the most thorough search failed

to reveal any such name or any such church.

The.

story relaying their experiences was

this. They had apparently gone to either the States Attorney

or the Attorney General for Illinois trying to have Arch-

bishop Marchenna, Bishop Fairfield (never heard of him)

and a Bishop Brown (never heard of him either) all declared

phonies and frauds. However,

they were advised, so lt is

that their only recourse was in civil court by

Quo warranto is a procedure

Seems as though we have heard

Then

the usual homosexual inferences were made,

to make

sure

that the pattern ran true to form. Why, oh why,

is that

they only thing these people can think

of? Of

course it

is the worst kind of smear and It is identical with that

used by the Communists?

I wonder if

the reason for using

that type of smear does not have a psychological explanation?

raised hob with the District Attorney. But, the damaged they

Intended to do had been done. This is

an important point because

Spoke with Bishop Hyde at approx. 8:30 P.M. our time.

(1) Read article over phone to me from

Washington EVening Star

about his church work and some sort of mission to military.

Basilians not mentioned.

(2) Denies any adverse publicity or that police were on nim.

Claims excellent relations with juvenile courts in

straightening out marriages etc.

Says Martin called him and had a Fr. Mario (no last name

mentioned) on the extension. A voice verified it was Fr. Mario.

Martin blamed Hyde for kicking: him out of the Church in

Washington.

Martin blamed Hyde because some police

come to his motel room at Kankakee and searched his baggages

Blamed Hyde for having him run out of Kankakee by both

the bishops and the police. Told Hyde he could get

no where in Chicago and blamed that on him too.

(4). A fewdays later phoned from Moorestown N.J. where he

said he was at home of Archbishop Starkey who heads

the North American Old Roman CAtholic Church - an apparntly

legitimate body and they are in vear book of American Churches.

Said he did not want to come to Washington because he was

afraid Hyde would call cops on him. Then tried to show

how he was a friend of Hyde. Said he torpedoed a meeting

at Kanakakee to protect Hyde since the bunch in Kankakee

were all phonies and frauds. Said it would be best for Hyde

to help him out with Starkey. Martin and this Fr. Mari

referred to Marchena as

"Mister"

saying he was anigger

fradd. Marchena is supposed to be Spanish.

(5) Hydd received an unisgned post card from Chicago threatening

Hyde. He said i

this

card that Hyde should leave him

would follow. Hyde says he went to Post Office people about

(6) Martin is publishing that Hyde is no good because he

associated

with Ferrie. Martin claimed that Bell told him ferrie took

plane from Miami and went to Washington where he

is now.

Martin demanded to tak to Ferrie on phone.

(7) In his contact with people at Kankakee they told a similar

story. Hyde.

says

and denied that anyone from Eastern

anywhere else was there. Did say that Kankakee police

were there at Marchena's request to run Martin out of town.

"Dear Father,

At Long last the 'wandering' seems to be over --July, August,

September and Cotoker!

After much looking around; much unsettled

mirid, I have taken a house in Atlanta and hope that from here our

work can once more be put on a firm and active foundation.

The house is nice.

On a street of 'middle class' houses. and not

too far fron

domtorn Atlanta.

There are three bedrooms, living

room, dining room, etc.

large-fenced back jard!

the room- just off the living room and connected by french doors

will make

a wonderful "house chapel'

apparently those certain fen who seek to destroy me do not knor I

an here.

Bishop Brow wrote that he did have a long, nutty letter

from Fairbanks.

We nor wonder hom Fairbanks knew I had been to

Kankakee.

But, all of that is over an done with.

by Fairbanks. or anyone else vill be met with in the most firm,

manner!

An old school mate of mine is an attorney here and he has

offered to take care of any such.

Have you read the book "Bishop's at Large"? Interesting. Especially

the section of Alexander Turner.

he who acted so high

and mighty

with us - who said me are not

"orthodox in the true sense." He hon

learn that he was a Liberal Catholic priest and in the bool: is mentiond

as a strange person.

I do hope you will plan on coming to Atlanta.

Gwise I do not think

there will be any trouble at all! Atlanta nor has one million paonle

....and serving them are: one Angic-Catholic parish,

17 RO parishes,

one Greek Orthodox, one Syrian Orthodox, one lelkite-fatholic and one

Maronite Catholic.

There is, indeed, room for us?

I don't havela pphnne jet --- perhaps by next meek!

Do Trite,

In Christ
