SUBJECT: NOSENKO FOIA Requests

Attached is a list of NOSENKO cases that are listed in

the GIMS TERM printout, according to the status of each

case.

I discovered a total of ten cases.

As we agreed this afternoon, I am sending to CI Staff a

memo requesting their assistance in processing these requests.

Russ Holmes told me today that he would visit CI/OPS and brief

them on the details.

NOSENKO CASES

OPEN CASES

1. F75-6669/WEISBERG

This request number covers several requests concerning

the JFK assassination. One query involves the Warren Commis-

sion's interest in NOSENKO. Though F75-6669 is still an oper

appeal

request,

WEISBERG will not be furnished with additional

Agency

documents until he pays the Agency the money he owes--

over $1000.

2. F77-0417/SULLINS

This is the first request which asked for all information

on NOSENKO. As the Oswald 201 file contained some documents

relating to NOSENKO, the processing of this request was halted

while the JFK/Oswald review was taking place. Some documents

from that review could now be released to SULLINS, but his

request must still be referred to CI Staff, as they hold a

large number of documents pertaining to NOSENKO and his handling

by CI Staff in the 1960s.

3. F78-1270/ HAYNES 03

Dof IPD has been holding this request in

(mistaken) belief that DDO has been actively working on

processing NOSENKO files.

4. F80-0605/CRAMER

This request asks for information on both NOSENKO and

GOLITSIN. It was referred to DDO in July 1980, but no action

has been taken on it.

CLOSED CASES

1. F78-1254/DORFF

specific questions

relating

to NOSENKO; answers to these questions

2. F79-0510/MARTIN

Requested copies of documents named in James J. Angle-

ton's suit against the Agency,

concerning the Agency's han-

dling

of NOSENKO. Some documents were released, in sanitized

form. CI Staff was involved in this case.
