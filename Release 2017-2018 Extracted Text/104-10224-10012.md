MEMORARDOM FOR:

THROUCH

SUB.JEC

: Head of la Career service

dollfication of lion eligibility for Designation as a

Participant In the ClA Ketirement and Disability System

As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment

History and current

career fleld of all employees in the Agency to identity

those who are cllglble

for destonation as a partielpant in the new ClA

Retirement and Disability System.

In this process, the Initial revlow of

each case ly made by the individual's career sorvice. If the lead of his

Career Service nominater him

for partlcipation in the System, Chis nomina-

ton is revlowed by the SlA Rottrement Board Wiich recommends final action

to me.

lovever, If the lead of the Career Service advises that the employee

does not muet the basle requirements of UR 20-50 for partielpation, I have

secepted

this finding without further review by the ClA Retirement Board.

This practice has been

adopted. in the incorest of expositing this screening

process eo that those employees who are ellgible eo parcielpate in the Sys-

ten may be designated

participanes as soon as

possible.

In your case, the lead of your Career Service has advised me

. that

you do not meet the requirenones of li 20-50 for deafgnation

pant and l have accordingly made the formal decermineton regufred by the

regulation that you are not ollable for designation. From a review of your

record le appears that the deedston of your career service was based upon

the fact that you have 19 years of more of Agency service, but have not as

yet performed 60 months of qualllying service as required by regulation. My

determination that you are not ellable at this time for designeton in no

way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,

reconsideration of your eligibillty

to parkleipate In

the CiA Syatem If you should meet the requirements for dostgnation in the

Should you desire further information concerning

the requlrements

for designation as a participant in the ClA Retiremont

System, I suggest that

you read paragraph e of lk 20-50 and paragrapli s of the limployee Bulletin

dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Publle Law 88-043, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Cortato Employeos."

4. I't 1s always possible that the records upon which the determination

made In your case may have been Incomplete or innecurate regarding your actual

employment history with the Agency.

If, after studying

above, you bave

questions regarding the

determination that you are not clagi

ble to partfelpate in the ClA Retirement System, please feel free to contact

officials of your Career Service.

They are familiar with the details of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

In addition, you may wish to dis-

cuss your case with the ClA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, MagazIne

Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions

you have regarding your ellatbility, you may request that your case he formally

considered by the CIA Rotirement Board. However, this request must be made with-

In 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

Mr. Wigren. Is doing a quite satisfactory job of running the ReA External Rescarch

Branch.

When the Group was reorganized he was almost fully conmitted to Duty No. 3

above.

While maintaining that function at a comendable level of performance, he

has accepted the assignment of running a new branch which is an amalgamation of

components of several previous R&A branches.

Comprising, as it does.

the disparate

clements of defector, contract, and staff officers,

Mr. Wigren has done a very

good job of assigning work and

getting

it done by

this branch.

He gets along well

with the personnel

and seens well-sulted

to the kind of bread-and-butter research

and analysis which the branch carries out.

He is very serious and purposeful in his

approach and can be relfed

on to carry out assigments effectively and on time.

long experience in Cl matters and his knowledge of past activities and events in the

Staff are a valuable adjunct to the branch chief function which he now fulfills:

He is one of very few officers of the former Staff who have, been selected to par-

ticipate in the reorganization and reorientation of the CI

effort.

He has shown

by his performance and attitude a quite acceptable capability to adjust to tha

present Staff requirements in temns of methodology and intellectual approach.

He is

conscientious and enthustastic, and is still feeling his way to some extent

organizationally and functionally in his new position.

Me reflects genuine consideration for the costs of performing his functions.

I have found Mr. Wigren to be a .

wary dependable and resourceful individual in undertaking the extensive research

commitments that the staff has undertaken in reeting very heavy obligations of

sensitive liaison

exchanges over the past year.

Wigren is above all a gentle-

man in his attitude toward and treatment of others.

I would say in the long run

ris, works

to his disadvantage because his contribution and his modesty

be overridden by the pretentions and bluster of others.

Mr. Wigren has what has

now: become a most precious

a grasp on many of the aspects of the collegial memory.

In the past six months the compartmonted nature of Nir. Wigren's ivork

has brought him more directly into the DC/CIOPS cognizance rather than the

Chief of the R&A component as has previoualy been the case.

I think Mr. Wigren's strengths and weaknesses have bean winnowed

thoroughly in previous reporting. He is a rocognized expert in his topic and as

such he represents a considerable capital investment by the Agency in that kind

#of expertise. He can write and he can speak with unusual fluency on his specialty

and in consequence is a key man in the ongoing rosearch and study of sensitive

Soviet intelligence and security organizationd and operations, particularly pone-

Since

SR/CI has changed, and

1s

now dirceted almost wholly to the creation and cxploltation of opera

tions.

The organization thus needs

more

urgently than ever the

digested operational experience which it is Mi. Wigren's job to

produce.

This

has made it necessary to apply strict priorities

based on operational need and relevancy,

which has been difficult

for Mr. Wigren, who has no direct opcrational experience. He

has not been able to get the most out of his people, nor give them

the sort of close and consistent guidance which some of them regutre

in the face

of changing or sudden requirements.

He has a tendency

to be over-concerned with organizational and burcaucratic exercise

to the expense of substantive production.

Nonetheless,

his

real'

qualities came to the fore recently when he produced well and used

his staff effectively on an important and complicated project.

Ho is a distinct asset in his responsible and demanding job.

Mr. Wigren performs his duties

Mr. Moren 10 extremely proficient in handling his section from both tie

In addition, he 10 an expert on soviet,

Intelliuence In his own right and lectures on the toric to officials of this

and other governments. He la particularly capatle at training now rescarches.

In reviewing his file today, I note that the Rarlowing Official for his

Pitness report of a yoar ago noted hio opinion that my ratings of Mr. Wigrer at

that time were too high.

That opinion was not discused with me or with

Mr. Wirer.

Perhaps the ratings were indeed too hien, but I must say that

considering the Fitness' Report form and criteria in use at that time and his

performance in relation

to that of other officers ir. this branch and outalde it,

I would give him the sam ratings today for that perioi.

The ratingu in this current report dill appear clichtly lower than those

of the last report. This lo not entirely due to tre dialerent report form.

Mr. Weren's problems increased in both intensity ard complexity during this

period, and I do not feel that he met the increased burden with as much o? ar

increase in performance as was necessary.

This shoulé not at all Jetract. fror

my rating of his overall performance, which 10 still exceptional and only

Balently less, than outstarding.

Amplify or exploin, il appropriate, salings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D lo provido the best Dosis for determining

future personnel actions.

Mr. Wigren has excellent

substantive background on the Soviet Union and,

except for a two year period on a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire

9 years in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another.

His performance for the past year in a job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's

can only be described as superior.

He has not only assumed responsibilities

greater than those of the previous incumbents; he has carried these out with

a minimum of support and in a calm, mature manner which has earned

respect on all sides.

Although his analysts have often been relatively

inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and

subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contri-

bution during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of

research in response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish-

ment of improved records and procedures to carry out this program.

Although Mr. Wigren would prefer eventual assignment to the field as an

operational officer, it seems to me his greatest potential lies in the kind of

research and support of operations he is presently performing. I would therefore

recommend that future training be oriented along these lines rather than strictly

operational lines, and that planning for his eventual field assignment should

emphasize his knowledge of Sovict Intelligence and his ability to deal with

other specialists in a "liaison" relation.

The factors which have turned this annual fitness

him - both of whioh actiona naturally refloot on his past performance.
