LA COSA NOSTRA

A newspaper article appearing in the

June 26, 1968, issue of the "New York Times," captioned,

"Cosa Nostra Men Cleared in Sicily," set forth information

in part to the effect that among others, one Francesco

scimone, Boston, Massachusetts, was cleared in court at

Palermo, Sicily, on June 25, 1968, of allegations of

reportedly running

narcotics and currency rackets for

the Italian "Mafia" and the American Cosa Nostra's crime

syndicates.

It is to be noted that indices of the Boston

Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation reflect

that in 1965 the above-mentioned Francesco Scimone, a

piano player andManager of the Coral Gables Club,

Weymouth, Massachusetts, was residing with the owner,

Gary Sloisi, at 70 Colburn Street, Hull, Massachusetts.

Investigation determined Scimone apparently was

wanted by the Italian police for allegedly associating

with Italian hoodlums in Italy. It had been determined

Scimone, on several occasions, while visiting Italy,

reportedly had been observed in the presence of Lucky Luciano.

Scimone was employed at one time as an orchestra

leader by both the Grace Lines, New York, New York, and had

occasion to visit Italy many times. Also, Scimone, in the late

1950's and early 1960's, operated two night clubs in the area

of Taoraina, Sicily, Italy, which were unsuccessful ventures

and were finally taken over by his brother, Agisto.

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (14 USC 2107 More)

DATE: 11-14-2017

LA COSA NOSTRA:

The Central Bureau, Criminal

- Division, Italian

National Police, Rome, Italy, advised in 1967 that the

Judicial Tribunal of Rome had inquired if Scimone was ever

considered a suspect in the attempted murder of Larry Gallo,

a New York hoodlum, or if he had otherwise come to the attention

of the New York Police authorities.

Investigation conducted by the New York Office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1967 determined

that Francesco Scimone, known to the New York City Police

and involved in the attempted Larry Gallo murder, is not

identical with the above-mentioned Scimone, the band leader

and Manager of the Coral Gables Club, Weymouth, Massachusetts.

Scimone; in a previous interview, advised he had

started civil action against 23 newspapers

in Italy for

"defamation of character," which action is being handled by

his attorney in Italy and he also had legal representation

in the United States relative to this matter.

It is requested that Legat, Rome furnish any

and all pertinent information regarding Francesco Scimone

and, in particular, if known, his present whereabouts in

the United States.
