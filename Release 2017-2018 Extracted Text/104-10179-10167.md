MEMORANDUM FOR : Chief, Special Affaire Stall

ATTENTION

: Mr. A. Rodrigues

SUBJECT

: Radio Switch Equipment for Demolition

Firing Purposes

03 1. Aller our conversation on this subject on 30 December,

the question was discussed with Mr

VTSD/AOB, and

• TSD/QRF. The following information if forwarded

for your consideration as a result of our discussions.

20,

Mr

7°

Audio Operations Brasch, recommenda two

companies ás sources of equipment of this nature. These companies

have experience, under classified contracts with TSD, in producing

reliable equipment for apecial purposes of this sort.

They also,

of course turn out commercial equipment of good quality for normal

communications acedo. These companies are:

&.

129,08

The TSD VHF radio swilth equipment for demolitica needa wa

leveloped for us byl

ransistorined sets have

been produced so moot the special needa (not for demolition purposes)

of other SAS projects.

3. In the opinion of both persons consulted, the expensés noted

in our firas discusaion should have produced a reasonable amount of

workable equipment if the source was both capable and reliable.

TSD recommenda the use of frequencies in the VHF/WHF spectrum fos

equipment of this sort and crystal tuning control for reasons of reliabilty

selectivity and rejection of spurious signalo.

short range communications, ete., is available from many

manufacturers. Our Quick Reaction Facility can produce a

small number of radio switches based on these devices with a

considerably leater degree of security from false signal triggering

with a lead time of 6 to 8 Weeks. Simple mechanical protection

against accidental triggering can be gained by inclusion of countin!

switches, for example, which reqisite a preset number of firing

Impulses intentionally transmitted to produce the final closure of

& relay and firing of a charge.

5. Reliability of operation in terme of response to a

tranemitted signal of a given power is quite difficult to predict when

conditione of antenna length, orientation and exposure cannot be

foreseen. Location of the receiver in a target building will also have

a strong bearing on 'range' from the transmitter. Building construction,

intervening obstacles and interference from other nearby radio fre.

quency sources will affect performance of the set.

6. If you wich to discuss the protiems in greater depth,

we recommend a conference with audio 'echnicians or engineers.

It may serve to clarily the appropriate haracteristica which special or m

modified commercial equipment shoule possess to mept the needs of your

operation Pablems of camouflaging the explosive or incendiary material

to serve operational requirements would be minor compared to the

necessary consideration of effecte on the receiver switch concealed

within which could have important effects on performance.
