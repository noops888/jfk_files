With LEE HARVEY OSWALD

On November 30, 1963, CG 6491-C advised SA ROBERT J.

TOMPKINS, Ir, that during December of 1960, he was engaged in

investigating

the activities of BEN JAFFE (who is presently the

subject of an Anti-Racketeering case under the Criminal Intel-

ligence Program in, Chicago; however, he resides in Las Vegas,

Nevada, and is the owner of the Tropicana Hotel). He advised

Rev BILL BEEN of St. Louis, Missouri, concerning BEN JAFFE

while in Del Rio, Texas in December, 1960.

He advised that he

read in the Chicago "Tribune" newspaper dated November 27, 1963

that the same Rev. BEENY of St. Louis, Missouri, reportedly a

candidate for governor of Missouri, had offered a home and job

to Mrs. LEE OSWALD.

He advised that he conversed with BILL BEENY regarding

BEN

JAFFE hasmuch as BEENY was leasing radio time on Station XERF,

Which is located in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico directly across the river

from Del Rio,

Texas and is allegedly owned by BEN JAFFE.

He advised that the nominees of JAFFE regarding the

Owner-

ship of this radio station

were ARTURO CONZALEZ and his partner

(ENU)

BOSQUEZ, well-known residents of Del Rio, Texas.

He' advised that he

knows of no un American activities or sympathizers of BEENY; however,

BEENY was closely associated with GONZALEZ and he, CG 6491-C, has

suspected GONZALEZ to be a Communist and closely associated with

Cuban activities.

" He advised that GONZALEZ IS married to a Cuban

and has made numerous trips to Cuba before and after the Castro

revolution.

CG 6491-C further advised that WILLIAM BURNES Of

International

Advertising Agency, San Antonio,

he,

"BURNES,

Texas,

is also familiar with BEENY as

was

engaged in securing radio time from station XERF on

behalf of BEENY.

CG 6491-C is characterized as a Dun and Bradstreet inves-

tigator as well as operating as a private investigator and is con-

sidered extremely reliable.
