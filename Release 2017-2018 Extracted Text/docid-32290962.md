Ilona Marita Z/renz, [with an expiration date of 6/23/82.

a preliminary inquiry was initiated

on 2/24/82, Ilona Marita Lorenz, 1085 Terrace Drive,

*Fagle Lake, Florida, was interviewed by SA James Patrick Laflin.

SEen ictators organized in true at a contactstn

Lorenz alleged to have born illegitimate children to:

Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of Cuba

General Perez Jimenez, Former Dictator of Venezuela

Ed Levy, New York Organized Crime Figure

Lorenz also alleged to have been an FBI informant for

various periods of time, dating back to 1960, when she was a member

of the 26th of July Movement.

Lorenz noted that most recently,

she had been providing information to SA Larry Wack of the New

York Office.

Lorenz had in her possession a considerable amount

of legal documents

and personal memorabilia to lend credence to

her statements, e.g. a Viking Press Publishing House contract

providing Lorenz with a $325,000 advance for her expose on Fidel

Castro, and a letter from Ballantine Books requesting the

exclusive rights to the autobiography of Dr. Fidel Castro Ruz.

Lorenz also verified travel to Cuba from 9/27-28/81..

Referenced Tampa telephone call to SA Larry Wack, NYO,

was made in order to verify Lorenz' bona fides. SA Wack indicated

that Lorenz had cooperated with the FBI in the

past, but she was

unstable.

SA Wack noted that Lorenz did associate with organized

crime figures, and

that her "affair" with Fidel Castro had been

highly publicized in the past.

SA Wack stated that Lorenz may

be providing information of some significance, but that Lorenz

penchant for exaggeration.

SA Wack recommended providing

Lorenz' complete novelette to New York for analysis and review:

SA Wack indicated that Lorenz' daughter, Monica, currently resides

in New York, and would be available to verify which aspects of

Lorenz' story were accurate and of a serious nature.

On 2/24/82, Ilona Marita Lorenz provided the following

information:

Her parents

were Commander Heinrich Friedrich (German) and Alice June Loflend

her father, who was at that time a Captain of the Berlin Bremen

Oceanliner.

Lorenz was schooled in languages and secretarial work

by private tutors aboard her father's ship.

to be disbursed at intervals.

For signing the contract, Lorenz

was immediately given $84,000.

T. H. Guinzburg, Viking Press, advised Lorenz to move

away from New York in order to avoid any further publicity.

During January, 1979, Lorenz moved to Darien, Connecticut, where,

based on the merits of her book contract, she received a loan of

$100,000 from the Peoples Bank in order to purchase a home at

86 Maywood Road, Darien.

On 4/16/79, Levy visited Lorenz to warn her the mafia

believed she had purchased the Darien home with mafia money stolen

by Levy.

Levy proceeded to make numerous long distance telephone

calls on her telephone, including one to Switzerland.

Lorenz

believes Levy did this

intentionally in order to implicate her

in his mafia swindle.

Levy told Lorenz that he was paying the Carlo Gambino

family in Brooklyn $10,000 per month in order to stay alive.

Levy asked Lorenz for part of the advance money from the sale of

her

book.

Lorenz wrote out a $10,000 check to Levy to cover

Levy's May, 1979, protection money.

Lorenz noted that Levy had already been convicted of one

count of mail fraud in New York, but had allegedly received a

reduced sentence for cooperating with the Federal investigators.

Levy was to report to Eglin Air Force Base Minimal Security Prison

the

following month to serve a six month sentence. Levy is

currently residing in Ft. Lauderdale, and will be off of parole

in March, 1982.

A week after Levy's visit to Darien, Connecticut, Lorenz'

house was intentionally flooded and her daughter wounded by a

sniper near their home.

A second shooting took place during

October, 1979.

All of these: incidents were reported to the Darien

Police.

Lorenz decided to abandon

the house and move the family

back to 512 East 88th Street, Apartment ID, New York.

During this

period, Lorenz had maintained the above apartment because of her

frequent trips back to New York City. Lorenz had been cooperating

with the NYCPD by providing research concerning a law suit by

Sturgis against the NYCPD. Sturgis was

suing the NYCPD for

$15 million for false

arrest.

Sturgis had been arrested for

threatening Lorenz prior to her testifying before the Sub-committee

on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
