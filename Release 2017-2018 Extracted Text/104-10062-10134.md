1. Hal Hendri: called my home on 10 May, saying that he wes

in Washingion and wished to see me.

Arrangemou: 6 were laler made lo

mect hin in doratowa Washington at a street correi at 8:00 am or

11 May. I picked him up as scheduled, and after driving around awhile

we had breakfast at the Marriot Mich in Rosslyn, after which i drove

him to the airport so he could catch the 10:30 a.m. plane to New York.

2. Isendrix had a number of points to convey, but nons of them.

were of such importance foi him lo have made a trip to Washingtón

just to see mie.

Thereforo, his coplunation sooms plausible that he wan

in Washingion basically to see Jerry Homifin of the 2ima/Liic burcau

to discuss a lead on who might have leated it documents to Jack Andercon

Hendrix explained that he was recontly told by a "Caribbean ruffen"

named Fau Goodfriend that the person who furnished the I'fi documents

to Jaci: Andercon was Irving Davidion, an old friend of Anderson sha some

years ago had once set anide a dcok in his office for Anderson lo use on

occasion, Goodfriond said that the picture of Dite Beard with & nunber

of her Vanhingion contacts published carly in the IlI scandal days had

included Davidson somewacre in the group, Davidson is deseribed as s

lobbrict for Die or more Latin Americon Covernments as well as for.

Israel. lannilin is considered a very knowledgcable and trusied friend

by Hendriz who wanted Hannifin's opinion whother Daridson might in

Inci ho a nource of indoreon's, Hamifin'o initial impression wes

that this wan a somote possibility, but he said he would chock around ard

the question of 11X. Hendiis said he come arcy from the mecting with;

Hanvitin probly well convinced that the load to Davidson as the source on

3. Hendrix commented to mu that the genoral locling in Mi. X.

in that there may be two

pencirations in the Wechington office, tro in

the N. J. office, and one in toir Clovelend office. Fe did not claborate.

k. Hendrix made the following comments about lne IT'T /Chile

documents:

A. He was aware that Raymond Brittenham, whom he

dorcribed as a senior Vicc Prosident and a bit of a fuddy duddy

who enjoys Farold Geneon's confidence, had first scen Jehr: McCone

and then como to Washingion recocily to talk with Agency representat

.. ...

about the ITT/Chile documents, 'Ons proposal Let Brittenhan lar

thought of discusing with the Agoney was thee several sensitive

documento be luencá over to the Agency for enfekeeping. Ee did

not seem to know whether this had actually been discussed by

Brittentem with the Agency. Ucndric ccia that I'rittenaam had

diccuseod with the Agency what lix might gay in the Serate

Locrings, whet the Agency might say, ile. @ did noi acknowiedge

having known tiat Drillerkom met with agcacy ssproconudires,

saying that this was presumably & 7ih floor matter.

He migat not

have bolioved ino, but i thought il bettor not lo confirin tes fact

to ling that & contact had in lack taken place cince he apparently

did not talk to brittenant himsell about thi5. 1

B. Fnu Schoicr, the lawyer of the firm in Washiagton

retained by IT as counsol for the expected Senale hearings on

Chilean activities of It'T, has told III officials that he thinks

the timing and intensily of the Senate sub-commitics interest in

the Chilean activities of ifT will depend on the goneral political

situation in the U.S., particularly in Vict Nana.

Schafer has boch

in touch with Pat ifolt, the eub-committee aide.

C. None of the IT T documonts oi: Chitc here been turnea

oves jet to the Senate sub-committee, The documente are still

being worked on by it't. Whon prescod as to the quantity involvod,

Jonizis noid the lotal is about 500 documents.

D. The three documents liondris mentioned to me at or

last mecting as boing incriminating from the point of vior of

documenting ITT funds of political activities in Chile have not

been dentroyed. ITT's chief lawyer in N.X. has sold Hendri:

that while away on a trip recently, at least four young lawyers

in his offico Icad these documento. He tried to transfer onc

of the lawyers out of his office, and the men thrcatened lo blow

the whistle on IIT over there documonts it transicsied. Onc

of tho other four lawyers feels equally strongly about ibesc

documents. As a resuli, the documento cannot be destroyed.

It io not clear, however, whether ITT plans to turn thess throc

documents over to the Senate. Evidentally ITT had first hoped

to lurn these documents over to the Aguncy for safelicosing in

preference to turning thom over to the Senate.

E. It has been dctermined by IIT lawyers that biocking

out propor names in docurnents before they tuin the documenis

over to the Senate sub-conmittec is perminsable. The IT'T

lawyers are now going over ali 500 documenta to do this, concentrat

On the names of Chilcans.

Is they finally turn over the three

sensitive documents to the committee, names of persons, barls,

and Anding mechanisms will be deleted, but the basic purpose of

ITT funding Alessandri canno: be hidden.

Fi. In discussing these three documents, Hendrix said

Are a raw a . 00

that the man in N.X. to whom It I was to bave paid the money for

Alessandri was (inu) Orchard; a Chilcan employed by UN Secretaria

(rather than a membor of the Chilean Mission to the UNI. The comp:

through which the payments were to be made was the Lone Slar

Shipping Company, (This agrees with information in the files).

I acked whether the Swiss Bank account number for other trans

actions was also listed thcre, and Hendrix looked puszled and said

that no Swiss Bank account was involved. When I pressed and

said my understendiug wer that carlice he had told me money for

the Edwards group went through a Swies account, he merely.

said there were no iclerences to thot in these three documenir.

He then said one of the three cocuments wre unfortunately a

reseage from Gerrity authorizing the: the Alessandri movement bo

civen "half the sum recommended by liendris."

5. Hendrix spoke by telephone to Berroller on 8 or 10 May at

which time Berielles reporied on a meeting that day with EÚBRiC-2

in Bucnos nires.

This was the firot time that they had mei since thcir

carly April meeting in N. Y. Berrellez told FUBRIC? that ho had not

been able to make the deposit on the secoud $100, 000 for reasons Hendrix

had explined earlier to ino, (EUbRIG-? was concerned by this and asked

that IT's do everything possible to resume these payments since he had .

money troubles. (Berrelloz romersed, however, dei EGRRIG-? seemed

in very good spiris poisonally, and quito optimistic about the chances

of the opposition in Chile). Hendrix plans to reopen te question of resuming

paymonts to the Edwards

people in Chile when he gets back to N.X. and

Bees Gerrity.

6. The U.S, manager of the ITT telephone manufacturing plant

in Chile slipped up to the States a fow days ago and ioported that he

thought the government would be moving in on the lt't property very

He had already been authorized by the company lo send his

and Jose Toj+, but Hendrix cominented that even Bornes was noir under

suspicion by the Government of Chile.

7. Hondrix heard yesterday from Bob Deach (phonetic) of the

Scripps Howard office in Washington that Ambassador Edward Korry had

left his position at OPIC and is now the president of a book soller's

association according to a press item which appeared within the last

two wecks. Hendrix was unaware of this and asked whether I knew

anything about it which I said I did not.

8. No had a rather interesling explanation of the by-play in

Chile on turning the ITT nationalisation question over lo the Congrers to

decide.

Bcareller reports that there has boen a delay in Allende's

proponal that Congress handle the ITT nationalization because of

disagrooment on how to procced, The fear of some hard-liners was

that the government was not being tough chough on IT?. Allende's intent

apparcully is to make a proposal that the Congress would be forced to

rejoct Miereby giving the Prosidoni e chance io call à plebiscite on ihe

issue which, being about lIt, he could not possibly lose. An interesting

thour!:.

?. The daughteï of Hendrix is engaged to Lewis ('TO")

Constontine, who is applying for a job with the agency. lic las passed

certain crams and was to have an interview in Weshington on ll way

followed by a physical exem shortly afterwards. A hitch has dovelopaà

in that he was origirelly cossidered for some sort of a job in the photo-

graphic ficld, but he has been told the job has now been filled by sorneone

who returned to tho job so that instead he is being offered a 2-3 yeas

contraci, probably lo go lo Jaos, He is not sure uf the carace opportunily

a contraci status would give him, and it tom boimeon this situation aud

some offer now bring made by INS. He has long vanied a job with the

Agency. (Hendrix claimed that Constantine is not aware that his fiancoe

Hendriz made a big point of thic.) i said it

would be porsible to check what the situation was and to find out what the

agency's intentions wore toward this porson, but tiat i coald not adoci

in zny way the decision of hiring, or unêce what conditions. Hendrin

was cardial at all tinos not to ant for spocial treatment, but rallier ho

esperosed a sligh decree of concern as to the apparent change in job

• offers. I replied that as for as I vaa awers, any person who was hirod

on a contrici basie who proved himseli to be of exceptionally lich

-

capability could ond up as a career employee with us, but it word repers

on employroct ceilings, etc, at the time such a switch was actively

considered.

to ceemed satistied with this answer. I acid Inould checi

and let his know if there were any unsual circumstances in this case.

My improssion is that Hendrix is not overly fond of this follow, but

respecis him and would noi try to, interfere on his bohole either way..
