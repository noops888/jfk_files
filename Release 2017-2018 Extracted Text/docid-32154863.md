On 12/13/63, LF 568-S* advised that on sane date [S

DoC., contacted BENNY ELAN (Phonetic) of thellistadrut,

Israeli labor'organization; in New York Cityjand discussed

with him Wistadrut sponsored trip to Israel in 1955. MORAIT

stated He had talked to JAKE CLEMMON (Phonetic), not further

Identified, about an unnamed person (context clearly indicated

reference to JACK RUBY) who may have made this trip to Israel

and attached himself to HAROLD GIBBONS. CLEMMON indicated

he had recently contacted Mr. WILLIAMS, National Director,

AFL-CIO, Louisiana, about this possibility.

During another discussion on 12/13/63 with an uniden-

tified person MORATT disclosed GRECG BARDAKI (honetic), not

further identified, had indicated the man In question who

made the trip to Israel

wont by the name of NATE or NAI STEINES

(Phonetic), a public relations man

from Los Angeles. The

unidentified person commented that if there was any possibility

STEIN was identical with "the guy" in Texas (context again

indicates reference to RUBY), BARDAKI probably would have

heard fron the FBI because WILLIANS had told the FBI about

above possibility (RUBY having taken a trip to Israel in 1955).

The informant further related [BlAN later disclosed

toMORATT he had talked to BARDAKI, who knows NATE STEIN:

BARDAKI Stated STEIN is not identical with "that mag""

' (RUBY)

whom BARDAKI had seen on TV. BARDAKI stated STEIN is a close

friend of JAlES HOFFA, Teanster official and leader. BARDAKI

added, in later explaining this matter to MORATT, that STEIN (S

was on trial about six months ago and HOFFA came to his

defense.

It was agreed that there was no basis whatsoever

for runor that this person who took the trip to Israel in

1955 is identical with RUBY.

MORANT also contacted AL ZACK (Phonetic) not further

identified,

to assure him that there

was no basis for the

above runor.

ZACK, apparently referring to FBI interview of

WILLIANS, remarked that "the man" told the FBI about two.

weeks ago, adding "If nobody has heard from it in two weeks

it is obviously not so."
