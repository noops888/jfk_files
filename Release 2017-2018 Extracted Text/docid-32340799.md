PROVENZANO stated that if CASTELLITO was

successfully done away with, the individuals involved

would share in a quarter of a million dollars which would

be obtained from labor contracts.

In addition, he pronised

BRIGUGLIO a business agent's job in Local 560.

Nothing was done in the matter for several months,

according to the informant; and PROVENZANO called another

meeting in his office at which he told those individuals:

that his trial in the DORN matter was coming up and the

contract should be handled before the trial started.

According to the informant, the first attempt

to kili CASTELLITO at. his home did not succeed because

CASTELLITO's wife and children were in the house at that

time.

The informant stated that a short time later,

CASTELLITO was lured to his sommer home in Upstate NewaYork

where he was finally choked

to death by BRIGUGLIO and

CINNO.

On June 10, 1965, NK T-I further advised that

the driver of the murder car when WALTER.

GLOCKNER was shot to death in Hoboken, New Jersey, on May 24,

1963.

as a witness against him in the DORN case.

Informant stated that before GLOCKNER was killed

PROVENZANO had ordered a "hit" on GEORGE PHILLIPS and also

On RAY CARNEY, but later called off the hits.

It is noted that GLOCKNER, before his death was &

member of the "Green Tiket" which faction in Local 560 1s

However, SALVATORE PROVENZANO is apparently not a member of

the Cosa Nostra while SALVATORE BRIGUGLIO is.

On 12/9/64, informant stated that GENE CATENA

has issued instructions to all members of his family who

had anything to do with IBT matters to cooperate fully

with ANTHONY PROVENZANO.

Informant further advised that

PROVENZANO was very upset with JANES R. HOFFA, the International

President of IBT, because HOFFA did not give him any support

during the trial

and attended no teamster's functions in

New Jersey since PROVENZANO's conviction.

on 1/27/65, informant stated that GENE CATENA

instructed PROVENZANO to send out an order directing all

IBT Locals in New Jersey to leave all union organizing in

Port Newark to the International Longshoremen's Association

(ILA). In addition, PROVENZANO assured CATENA that the ILA

is welcome to organize any company in the Port Newark area

that is currently represented by the IBT.

On 2/8/65, informant

advised that GERARDO CATENA

met with PROVENZANO

a few days before that date.

PROVENZANO

had apparently issued two conflicting IBT charters, one of

which was to ROSARIO MOGAVERO, a close friend of CATENA.

At this meeting CATENA made it plain to PROVENZANO that

MOGAVERO was not to be harmed financially in any way.
