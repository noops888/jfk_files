street Post Office substations to be alert for specific

type envelopes postmared in How loris City or Fashington,

D. C.; those enveiopes in turn coule be brought to his

SULLIVAN cormented that approximtely a total

of 30 mail handlore are utilined in porting the mall at the

Roosevelt Pack Aunax for tho, Sunstations.

These same

handlers work 24 hours a day, eight hour shifts, and are

assigned permanently to sort the nail for the rospective

substations

SULLIVAN advised that he would be most willing to

cooperate with the bureau in any manner possible.

Ke mentioned.

that in a project of this type FBI interest would never

become known to the respectivo mail handlers as it could be

casily passed off to them as a project being handled by the

Postal inspectors: Detroit.

/Preliminary investigations, similaa to the soca»

Program, would be initiated on individuals who are the

recipients of "suspect" letters.

The Detrolt Division desires to initiate such y

program on a trial basis, in the event Dureau approves.

It is felt FBI interest would be known only to T. ESTT

SULLIVAl and posslbly toone or ino oi his subordinates.

in

this regard it should be noted that a project of this tyre

could not be handled by Bureau personnel only, because vi.

security linitations and lack of mangover.

The Bureau's and

couments and observations

are solicited with respect to Detroit's proposal notor abore.

It is felt, however, in the event the Bureau concurres

This Facility would have to be covered since some

of the pouched mail is not handled again at Detroit Alf,

It was worth's opinion that approvinately fifty

Post Office Personnel would be involved in the overall air

mail operations at this Facility.

In this regard, it should

be noted that the air nail section is immediately surrounded

by some

pecessarily create a "securisy problem".

In the event the Bureau subsequently approves a

This is the main AlF, Detroit, and would have to be

covered on a twenty-four-hour basis.

In addition to the

It is the policy of this All to send "bundles" (made up

either according to city nod/or, country) on the first availahle

These "bundles" may or my not be reworked at the

This All' is located in one of the Willow Run Als

Field buildings which is approximately seventy-five feet by

125 feet. This building has no

partitions other than a small

elass encased office for the superintendent in onet corner of

the building.

Necessarily, it any scanning process was ini

Crated, all Post Office Personnel at this Facility would have

WETzEl estimated that this Facility would handle

approximately sixty post Office Personnel.

The confidence of WILLIAM C. HAINEMAN, Supervior,

would have to be developed.: (Detroit indices contain no

infornation pertinent to security identitiable with WILLIAM

C. MANNEMAN. )

In view of the fact that security appears to

present a problem both at the RPA and Willow Run AXF, it is

folt that any future monitoring operation should be arrarged

st the headquarters levei.

It is not felt that either

intendent would

approve such an operation on his own because

of the fact that "Inowledge" of the operations would necessarily

have to be knowa to other numerous Post Office Personnel,

(It hes been SA ROTHVUSS! observation through "Kobcase" inves

tigation,

that generally superintendents of various Post office

stations will cooperate fully with the Bureau; however, such

cooperation would not be known to other post Office Personnel

other than the superintendent and his imediate assistant).

I's addition, if the nonitoring program should be.

initiated, it would be necessary to obtain the cooperation and

confidence of the Postnaster, E.. L. BAKER.

Detroit indices contain no infornation pertinent to

Security identifiable with E. L. BAKER other: than an article
