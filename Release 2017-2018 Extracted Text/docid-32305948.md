driven away, but he remained at the airport with the plane.

He added, MEDICO, the

man whom he believes was BUFALINO,

and the

unknown man returned to the airport and they flew

back to Avoca the same day.

explained the reason he thinks one of the

on this flight was BUFALINO is that BUFALINO was

definitely involved in the September 13, 1957 incident

and he is positive he recognized him as having been on the

June 24, 1957 flight.

He also recalled that PAGNOTTI told him

the sick man from Detroit was a "big shot" but he did not

recall the name, and when the name ANGELO POLIZZI was mentioned,

he was not sure

this was the name

he heard.

With regard to the September 13, 1957 incident,

PAGNOTTI called him in the late afternoon of this

day and told him "they". had asked him if his plane could be

used for a flight to Detroit. PAGNOTTI did not further

identify "they."

found numerous thunderstorms existed or were forming

between Avoca and Detroit.

He said RUSSEL BUFALINO was

already at the airport waiting for him, and he was accompanied

by several other men, names not known

since all but one

remained in their car.

I was not anxious to make this flight due

to the weather, and informed BUFALINO he would not make the

flight. BUFALINO responded he had to be in Detroit by

8:30 p.m. that night and remarked he had a ticket on the

Allegheny Airline, but the flight had been cancéled because

of engine trouble in the plane.

suggested they go

to Binghamton and take a commercial flight from there.

BUFALINO accepted this suggestion under the impression

was going to fly them there. However,

asked him how

long it would take to drive to Binghamton and when he found

out they could make it in 50 minutes, he suggested they drive

since it would take him at least 50 minutes to get the plane

ready to fly and since there were storms there also, he
