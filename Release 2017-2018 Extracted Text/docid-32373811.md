He also obtained information from

Identities 1y2,

and 3,

and from a number of occasional informants

whom he knew as business acquaintances.

3.

Biographical and operational data on AMFAUNA-37 were

forwarded in UFGA 11657 and UFGA 11758 of 9 October 1963. AMFAUNA-13

explained that AMFAUNA-37 had been unable to accept an SW system

because of responsibility to his mother who is paralyzed and has to.

receive injections every two hours around the clock. Nevertheless,

AMFAUNA-13 has found AMFAUNA-37 useful and has the utmost confidence

in him. Arong AMFAUNA-37's informants are a medical corpsman at the

Sap Antonio de Los Banos Airforce Base, and a doctor who works in

the Havana Naval Hospital. AMFÄUNA-37 also takes professional

trips to the Isle of Pines. He was left in contact with AMFAUNA-27.

4.

unidentified attorney who is a long-time member of the Cuban Communist

Party, and his firm's salesmen who travel throughout the Cuban

Identity 4 is one of the latter; he spends about twenty

DISPATCH SYMBOL AND NUMBER

UFGA-11846

Early in 1962 AMFAUNA-13 asked AMFAUNA-36 to recommend an

English language teacher.

She introduced AMFAUNA-13 to Identities

2 and 3, two American ladies who used to be Dominican nuns and are now

lay persons,

who give private English lessons in their home to advanced

language students.

AMFAUNA-13 began studying with Identity 2.

Before long he

noticed that other students appeared to be giving intelligence infor-

mation to the ladies.

Eventually he told Identities 2 and 3 that he had

a channel for getting such information to PBPRIME if they cared to use

They did;

and AMFAUNA-13 was now receiving intelligence reports

from them Which he passed to AMFAUNA-1.

Reconstructing what happened subsequently, AMFAUNA-13 reasons

that Identity 3 must have had some clandestine relationship with AMBIT-2

Süspects of being a PBPRIME intelligence agent; in any case,

Identity 3 told AMBTI-2 that she was passing her reports out through

The first that AMFAUNA-13 knew of this was in about October

1962 when AMFAUNA-36 told him that AMBIT-2 had warned her to beware of

the man in the apartment below hers (AMFAUNA-13) who he said was "working

for ODENVY."

AMFAUNA-36 said she had told AMBIT-2 that he had gotten his

facts mixed up, and that the man who had been working for ODENVY was a

doctor who lived around the corner and who had already been sentenced for

counterrevolutionary activities.

AMFAUNA-13 then consulted with AFAUNA-l who told him that this

was a dangerous situation and that he had better stop receiving reports

from Identity 2 and Identity 3.

AMFAUNA-13 therefore told them that his

contact had left Cuba and that

he had no other way of getting their

Identity 3 told him that this was all right because she

had another putlet.

9. In about July 1963, AMFAUNA-13 was told by a certain "Aurelio",

a stevedore in the Havana docks whom AMFAUNA-13 had originally met when

he was damage control inspector at the docks, that a ship had arrived

at the Muelle Hacendado in about May 1963 carrying an undetermined

number of Chinese in civilian clothes.

About two weeks later, while taking his English lesson from

Identity 2, AMFAUNA-13 heard Identity-3's pupil tell her that about 500

Chinese had arrived by ship in Havana, and that some of them were

replacing Russians at the San Antonio

de los Banos air base.

Identity 3

picked up the telephone and relayed this information to an unknown per-

son. El English double-talk.

AMFAUNA-13 consulted with AMFAUNA-I who told him that he did

not put much stock in this report,

but that if it were true it was

important and that they should try to verify it.

This accounts for the

report on this subject in AMWEE-l's photo message no.

109 of 4 September.

AMEAUNA-1 had not been trying to get an intelligence report out, but had

merely been passing an operational lead to AMWEE-2.

12.

Traces are requested on Identities 2, 3, and 4.

traces are negative.
