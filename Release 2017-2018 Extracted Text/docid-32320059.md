Title: INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES TO ROOM 11134

Synopsis: The walls in and between room 11134 and room 11144

need to be demolished to make one large open work space.

Details: The Space Management Unit (SMU) designated rooms 11144

and

11134 to be occupied by the HERU. Room 11144 became

available in July 1997, while room 11134 remained occupied by

CJIS until October 1, 1997.

Now that room 11134 is vacant, it is requested that all

internal walls within room 11134, as well as the walls separating

room 11134 from room 11144 be taken down to make one large open

work space to accommodate the HERU.
