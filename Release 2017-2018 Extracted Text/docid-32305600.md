SD 92-184

DALITZ and COHEN met SD 1064-C-TE and ROSELLI

at Hyatt House and they all then went to the Brown

Derby Restaurant nearby.

Informant advised that ROSELLI thereafter informed

DALITZ he wanted money he felt was due him.

During the

discussion, ROSELLI claimed that he had a

major part in

sale of Desert Inn to HOWARD HUGHES bY DALITZ and claimed

that through his efforts DALITZ remained on, in a managerial

capacity, in the Desert Inn and Stärdust Hotels, Las Vegas,

after the sale to HUGHES.

ROSELLI claimed that during the

presale negotiations he was present with GEORGE GORDAN

and MORRIS KLEINMAN and that he (ROSELLI) was supposed to

get $60,000 per month from the time of the sale until time

DALITZ left the hotels.

He indicated that he received none

of this' money.

He also indicated that his $60,000 a month

due him was not for him alone but that he also had

to distribute some of it to "his people," nodding toward the

informant. ROSELLI indicated that as a

result of his

efforts, HUGHES was

able to purchase the Desert Inn and later

the Stardust and that DALIT? thereafter was in a position to

continue skimming money.

ROSELLI explained that he was now short

of money as the result of continued legal pressure and

convictions.

Informant advised that DALITZ denied having any

knowledge or remembering

any details to such an agreement

with ROSELLI. DALITZ told ROSELLI that if he was trying

to shake him down he was not going to stand for it. DALITZ

claimed that he has always been "100% straight" and at this

late date

he was not going to stand for a shake down.

DALITZ further told ROSELLI that he always

considered ROSELLI to be a millionaire and did not know

that he was in need of money at this time. He told

ROSELLI that if money meant keeping him out of jail it

was a different story and he would assist him but again

stressed the fact

• that he was not going to be the victim

of a shake down.

ROSELLI continued to claim that DALITZ and his

group owed him $60,000 a month from the time HUGHES

purchased the hotel until DALITZ's group left the

management.

DALITZ ended the discussion by saying that he

would go to Miami and discuss it with KLEINMAN, GEORGY
