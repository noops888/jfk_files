10 REF AGAIN RAISES QUESTION OF AMWEST 1 STATION DOES

NOT THINK HE LIKELY BE OF VALUE AS SOURCE, BECAUSE LACK OF ACCESS,

HIS PERSONALITY, OPPORTUNISM, ETC., BUT HE MUST FEEL MORE

THREATENED NOW THAN AT ANY TIME IN RECENT PAST AND PRESUMABLY

WILL SE THAT MUCH MORE APPROACHABLE.

20 IF AMWEST 1 DOES NOT DEFECT OF OWN ACCORD, AND DOUBT ME

WILL DO SO AS LONG AS HE NOT ORDERED HOME, IS HOS INTERESTED IN

DEFECTION OR RECRUITMENT APPROACH? DOUBT HE WOULD BE OF ANY VALUE

OTHER THAN AS DENIAL TO PBRUMEN FOREIGN OFFICE, BUT THIS ALONE MIGHT

SERVE HOS PURPOSES. THERE IS SOME CHANCE HE HAS OTHER BLOC

CONTACTS INCLUDING SOVIETS WHICH WOULD BE OF INTEREST.
