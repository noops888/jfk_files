DO SCHICK 1S CERTAIN IN HIS OWN MIND THAT LUIS SOMOZA HAS NO INTENT

TO STAY ON AS CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. HE EXPLAINED THIS. AS GOOD POLITICS, SAYING

SOMOZA'S PRESENCE WOULD KEEP THE MILITARY IN CHECK AND ALLOW TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING

REFORMS. HE HOPED THAT ON THE EXPIRITION OF MIS, SCHICK'S, TERM OF OFFICE, NICARAGUA

THE ANTI-CASTRO CAUSE GLANDESTINELY, BUT SCHICK ADDED THAT SUCH HELP IS CONDITIONED

UPON THE IMPLIED APPROVAL OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. IF SUCH APPROVAL 1S GIVEN

ARTIME CAN COUNT ON NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT.

SUBSEQUENTLY, AS AN ADDITIONAL CONDITION, SCHICK SAID THAT IF PRESIDENT

KENNEDY APPROVES, AN AVERICAN REPRESENTATIVE MUST BE SENT TO CENTRAL AVERICA TO

Current Rumors in PBRUMEN Exile Commnity

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

да...

MERGEAN

1. As usual the first month of 1969 featured a large number of rumors

making the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile commnity.

While we normally tend

to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they

relate to GPVALIANT.

The first of these rumors deals wich a new sroup which has pre-

sumably been formed for the purpose of trying to deal through GPVALIANT.

Among those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos,

Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari.

This group reportedly meets every Thurs-

day at different houses:

The last meeting in January was held at the home

of Lincoln Rodon.

At this merring Prio presumably stated that Butard was

« better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando.

The general

consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business

partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT.

The rumor mill has it that the group intends to pretend that it favors

political and democratic: solutions to the PBRUMEN problem but that they

really seek armed intervention.

In this same connection Father O'Farril

has recently told AMPALM-A that AMBIDDY-l is once more connected with HOFIRM

and that ANCORE-2 has joined him.. The rumor mill says further that AMBIDDY-I

and AMCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit

encouragement of the above group.

According to AMPALM-A O'Farril himself

does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-l and ANCORE-2 wanting to estab-

lish training camps.

O'Farril feels that the solution AMBIDDY-l is looking

for is through agreements between INFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.

NIBALDA has picied up infornation quite similar to that learned

through AMPALM-A. He also has reported the existence of this group and

said that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy arms

and equipment to overtirow AMTHUG- 1.

According tr WIBALDA important me-

bers of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor, and Ortodoxos are in-

volved even though these organizations themselves are not participating

as groups in the or De.

5. The bove information is being forrarded strictly as unfounded

le are passing it along only because it represents

another indication of what the exiles are expecting from GALiAsT.

find the rumor concerning AYBIDDY-I particularly interesting and suspect

that it may be an outgrouth of the recent report we. have received from

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: O Termination of Manuel Artime Buara

le On the nicht of 13 January 1967 the writer

met with Artime in a

room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida.

The purpose

of the meeting was to formally terminate Artime's association

with the Agency.

This involved the obtaining of termination

Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover

the final periodical payment through 31 Docember 1966 and

obtaining outstanding receipts.

2.

The meeting was cordial and all paper work involved

in the proceedings was accomplished without incident.

was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had

done (or tried to do)

for the Agoncy in the past and an un-

doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that he was ready

and willing for any task he might be called upon to do in

the future.

3.

Artime made only one request rather passionate

one.for financial asaistance for the imediate family members

of two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR)

members who were executed fy the reault of operational missions

to Cuba and the wife of anucher who is serving a 30-year

mentence. (It will be recalled that Artime has been furnishing

receipts for the $3,000 he has been receiving in recent months

claiming that the money goes to the families of MRR members

who have lost their lives or been imprisoned while on MRR

miasions.)

We are examining these three cases and if worthy

will arrange for financial benefits under the "survivors and

martyrs" section of the AMBUD activity.
