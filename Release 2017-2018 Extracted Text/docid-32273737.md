Dear Mr. Schwars:

I have your letters of July 14 and 15 to Dr. Rhoads, who is away this

week and next, and I want to acknowledge b√∂th of them for him.

Since the first letter arrived, Dx. Dandel J. Roed, Asaistant Archiviat

quest it contained and received frou hin instructions for the Kennedy,

Johnson and Elsenhower libraries. Unfortunately there were some

Initial misunderstandings between your staff and Mr. Wilderotter which

I hope have now been worked out to your satisfaction. If there 1s

anything further I, Dr. Rhoads, or Di. Reed can do to assist your

investigation, ploase let us know.

Sincerely,

James E? O' kill

Dear Dr. Rhoads:

As the Select Committee proceeds with its investigation of

paramilitary operations--in particular in Laos--it finds that it

needs to review minutes (or memoranda of conversation) from meetings

of National Security Council bodies conducted during the Eisenhower,

Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, as well as notes, memos, studies.)

and other materials on this subject lodged in the Presidential

libraries.

Members of the Committee staff have been in touch with Dr. Reed

of your staff, who indicated that NSC material should fall within

the "section 11" category for White House documents--that is, docu-

ments to which the Archives can grant access on its own authority.

Dr. Reed did indicate that you would, of course, consult with the

White House; that should be no problem given the understanding the

Committee has with the White House about access to documents neces-

sary to our inquiry.. Our contact point at the White House is

Mr. James Wilderotter (406-7094), who should be able to provide the

necessary clearance.

Members of the Committee staff have been or will be contacting

the three libraries notifying them of our need to review these mater-

ials. We understand that an oral assurance from you that the clear-

ance has been obtained will suffice.

nat a sural as

At this time, we are interested in reviewing documents pertaining

to paramilitary operations in general and to Laos in particular for

the period mid-1950's through the 1960's.

Members of the Committee staff who will be reviewing these docu-

ments are (with the security clearances each possesses) :

William Trueheart (TS/SI/K/B)

Dorothy C. Dillon (TS/SI/K/B)

Due to requirements of preparing background materials as quickly

as possible, it would be helpful if the staff members could review

the NSC materials later this week.

We would appreciate your assisting

in such

expedition.

Sincerely yours,

Frederick A.0. Schwarz, Jr.
