On July 23, 1959, MARQUEZ telephonically contacted

the Miami Office and among other things, furnished the

following information to SA THOMAS H. ERRION:

MARQUEZ left Miami for Cuba on June 21, 1959, and

returned to Miami on about July 16 or 17, 1959.

While

in

Cuba he visited frequently with JUAN ORTA. ORTA told

MARQUEZ he would be contacted by someone in Miami and that

they wanted MARQUEZ to furnish them with information concerning

ex-Cuban Senator ROLANDO MASFERRER and former Cuban

Revolutionary Intelligence Officer JULIO LAURENT. U

MARQUEZ met One (FNU) O'HARA and stated O 'HARA's

first name may be "CABRIEL." O'HARA was working at the

Hotel Colina in Havana and appeared to be a person of

consequence in the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP),

the Cuban Communist Party. O'HARA told MARQUEZ that

JOSEPH CARBONELl was one of their boyss:

was working for

the Communists and not to worry about him. MArQuez said

this remark was made after he had said that CARBONELL

apparently was trying to join ROLANDO MASFERRER's party. U

It should be noted that information furnished

by MARQUEZ on July 23, 1959, was in a general manner and

priOr to obtaining specific

information of a more detailed

nature, MARQUEZ stated that he had to terminate the call

because of someone whom he did not wish to know that he was

making any call.

He stated that he would recontact SA ERRION

when he felt that it was safe to do so. He had previously

requested that contact be made by him and attempts to

contact him be at an absolute minimun. To date, he has not

recontacted SA ERRION and attempts to contact him have been

negative. The last attempt was made on August 26, 1959.U

On July 1, 1959, RICHARD B. JAFFE, Miami,

Florida, informed SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR., that he did not

know how JOSE CARBONELL happened to become involved in the

seizure of the airplane and three individuals along with a

quantity of arms made at the North Perry Airport by Broward

County Deputies on June 30, 1959. JAFFE said that he

personally knew nothing concerning CARBONELL, but that a

friend of ROLANDO MASFERRER's brought CARBONElI, tO MASFERRER

recently. t

On July 3, 1959, MARIANO FAGET, 75 S. W. 32nd

Court Road, Miami,

former Chief of the Bureau for the

Repression of Communist Activities (BRAC) , Informed

SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR. that CARBONELL was leaving that day

for Cuba. FAGET expressed the belief that CARBONELL

may have been an informant planted by CASTIQ's Government

against MASFERRER.

On September 4, and 9, 1959, RICHARD B. JAFFE,

PSI Under Development, Miami, confidentially voluntarily

inforned that it is a reasonable assumption on the basis

of information obtained from MASFERRER that shortly after the

middle of September, 1959, there would be wide spread

terrorist activities against the CASTRO Government in

Pinar del Rio Province..

JOE CARBONELL of Miami had been

receiving instructions

from MASFERRER relative to this

activity in Final del Rio province and Bad maid

one or more

trips to Cuba in cornection with this matter.

On Auzust 20, 1959, JOSE CARBONELI telephonically

contacted SA LEMAN L. STAFFORD, IR. and stated he desired

to see him away from the premises of the Miami Office.

He

was interviewed that date by SAS STAFFORD and ROBERT E.

SUNKEL at which time he furnished the following information

confidentially:

He related that while he had previously

sympathized with the Communist Party, he now realized how

wrong he had been in his sympathies.

He stated he now felt

that he wanted to do something as a service to the United

States Government in helping to combat Communism in Cuba

and that it was his feeling that the Cuban Government of

FIDEL CASTRO was filled with persons of Communist leanings

and sympathies, although he could furnish little specific

information regarding the allegation. Yu
