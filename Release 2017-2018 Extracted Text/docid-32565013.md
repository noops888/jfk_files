BUFALINO, aka

ReBuairtel 8/25/64 requesting Phila. to advise

the Bureau by return communication precautions taken to

insure that PH 701-C* Is not compromised.

As the Bureau 1s aware, PH 701-C* was Installed

utilizing an altered telephone instrument.

â€¢ This instrument

affords the best security available in this type of in-

stallation.

BUFALINO as is known from previous information

furnished by PH 623-C* is suspicious of any telephone

instrument.

For example, he has advised PH 665-0-TF. to

be extremely cautious in using the telephone and not

necessarily the telephone involved with PH 701-0*.

He

does, however, even after cautioning

freely with this informant.

PH 665-C-TE, talk

BUFALINO made the comment that he thought his

telephone was tapped during a telephone conversation.

It

appears, therefore,

that BUFALINO is not suspicious of

coverage being afforded by PH 701-c* but is suspicious.

of telephones being "tapped."

Resident Agents

in Wilkes-Barre have previously

been advised and were again reminded on 8/26/64 to be

alert for any information

that might develop which would

indicate that this source had been compromised.

Employees

handling the Central Plant in regard to PH 701-C* were

again on 8/26/64 reminded to be alert for this type of

information.
