MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact Report, 8 May 1967

PARTICIPANTS: Edward G. TICHBORN

PLACE

1. Preliminary meeting was in the hotel room but the bulk of the dis-

cussion took place during lunch and afterwards. The gist of the discussion

with TICHBORN was as follows:

a.'

TICHBORN explained how he had been surprised at the sudden

loss of interest by Antonio Menendez in the project and particularly in

introducing TICHBORN to other contacts. TICHBORN says that the

reason for this is Menendez' sudden recognition of the danger to his

political future in even indirectly being connected with what could become

a controversial book.

TICHBORN attempted to develop various hypotheses

for the revelation of this fear at this time rather than earlier in the

negotiations. There was, however, no really clear explanation of why

Menendez had so suddenly drawn into his shell.

b. TICHBORN was asked whether he felt that in some ways we

were not "taken" by Menendez. He responded with considerable heat by

saying that it was a calculated gamble that "just didn't pay off".

He

became very defensive when the discussion turned to the original evaluation

of Antonio Menendez. He says that he is convinced that Menendez has

the information as well as the cortacts and in short was the right man but

one who turned out to be unwilling to run the risks involved for the "small

amount of money" he would be paid. TICHBORN attempted to make a

strong case for his belief that Menendez was the right man and emphasized

(somewhat apart from the point) that some day he will have an important

post in a future PRI government.

TICHBORN says the whole problem

was discussed with

who agreed that the project could not be

productive now due to the sudden reluctance of Antonio Menendez and

Jose Luis Siqueiros to introduce TICHBORN to their contacts.

also felt, according to TICHBORN, that it would be risky.for

TICHBORN to contact Gonzalez Casanova, Cholula and Urquidi.

While

details of the discussions between

_and TICHBORN were not!

given, it seems that the decision not to proceed was reached without any

major hassle between TICHBORN and 1

(Comment: TICHBORN

appear's to be not at all unhappy about terminating what could have i!

become a long and unproductive research effort built on a shaky story

of TICHBORN writing a book on the PRI. )

c.

Antonio Menendez wrote up in English some of his comments.

based on his approach to the research problem. This 13 page double

spaced report is attached.

d.

Chaconas asked TICHBORN how well he knew Carlos Fuentes

(for possible BGBERET targeting). TICHBORN replied that he knew

him very well and that he felt he could approach him directly if he had a

reason for being in Paris (vacation, for example) or wherever Fuentes

is now living.

TICHBORN said that he believed Fuentes would accept an

assignment to write articles on North Vietnam based on a future visit

to that area but he also indicated that he believed we could not control

the tone of the articles which would be likely to be pro-North Vietnam. •

2. TICHBORN was asked

to review the list of trips TICHBORN

had made outside the country and to confirm the dales and advances involved.

asked TICHBORN to get a list from his cover company of his domestic

trips so that when the cover company submits a claim, WH will have a record

of what trips were authorized for operational purposes involving TICHBORN.

TICHBORN, on the same subject, said that he feels as does his cover company

boss that some other arrangement should be made for some of his travel for

WH. TICHBORN says he feels that the amount of travel he is involved in may

appear unusual to the cover company accountant. _

agreed that this was

not a good situation over the long run and that he would talk

about making different arrangements for the future.

3.

TICHBORN was requested to rebate the $171. 18 owed from the advance

given him in Mexico for his trip there on 17 March.

He offered to write out

a check but

suggested that he send the check throughthe proper channels

to the post office box number given him. He also promised to send the

accounting for the latest trip to Mexico City in as soon as possible. TICHBORN

was reminded of the need to send in his April and May loan payments which he

agreed to do right away.

Copy of letter from Edward G. TICHBORN

"On or about September 10, 1966 I had a meeting with three ni

four gentlemen in Washington (as I recall, they were

and someone else) and I informed

these gentlemen that my moving expenses had been considerably

more than I had estimated. However, I told these gentlemen that

rather than ask for an additional amount, I wished to serve a

moratorium of loan payments for six months. One of these

men (with a nod from other) said "okay--don't worry about it--

just don't ask for an additional allotment. We'll take care of it."

"At this point we moved on to another topic, and I assumed I would

be allowed to skip payments for six (6) months.

SUBJECT

: Contact Report, 8 December 1205-1600 hours

PARTICIPANTS: Edward & TICHBORNL

PLACE

1. TICHBORN arrived at the meeting site in the lobby five minutes

late.

We went up to the hotel room where the following business items

were discussed.

a. He was told of his overpay of $872. 37 which he said he would

return at once by check to

b. TICHBORN was reminded of the requirement that he pay his

premiums of S. 63 for his health insurance. He was told he owed,

for the period of October through January, and it was suggested that

he pay by check directly to the above box.

He was told that there' was'

no expiration notice sent out on the premiums being due; hence, it was

up to him to keep the matter current.

He was told that Finance was interested in obtaining his

monthly payments of $125 in repayment of his loan of $3, 000.

Apparently he had last paid in July.

He requested an extention or'i"

moratorium through January 1967 due to his heavy expenses involved

in moving.

TICHBORN was shown copies of the "White" FBIS publication.

After he has looked at these,

he will notify

as to whether he

wants copies in the future mailed to the post office box which he has

now obtained.

e.

TICHBORN was told that the $575 which he had lost on a

TDY trip about a year and a half ago has now been officially written off.

had received an envelope from TICHBORN which carried

his pseudo on the outside as sender but had a phony address).

2. TICHBORN submitted his proposal on the PRI study which he

estimated would cost $3, 800. Since it did not have a research plan or

outline,

requested him to send one as soon as possible.

TICHBORN

believes Menendez is indispensable and that his services are worth i l!

the $2, 000 he has projected. TICHBORN feels that his plan is not as"

complete as it might be but would be of a very useful size and scope

and could be completed in six months.

briefed TICHBORN on

the peculiarities of our operational interest in research as contrasted to.

the traditional academic approach. TICHBORN seemed to understand.

these distinctions very clearly.

3. TICHBORN had a preliminary report entitled 'Press Reaction to

Balaguer". He said that last week he had finally found a newstand on

146th-Street where he could buy daily issues (only about a day late) of p

El Caribe, Listan Diario and Ahora.

briefed TICHBORN on our (WH), reluctance to send him on

missions to other areas.

He indicated that he had not heard of the

Spanish trip

He quickly said that he thought such a trip was

justifiable from the standpoint of Spanish relations with Latin America,

etc. etc.

5. He agreed that he would be of very limited use for in other

areas and said that he had so informed

proposed earlier.

FROM :

IN RE: Projected triP throuch Latin America

Bearing in mind that our executive committee

may. (at

some future but presently undetermined date) desire

to undertake in-depth surveys of economic conditions. In

certain Latin American countries, we consider it highly de-

sirable to establish prior contacts witn the banking and

business communities of several selected areas which are

most likely to offer

sound investment opportunities:

our past experience indicates that it 1s much easter to

assess spontaneous financlal ventures if one is already

acquainted with the business ambiance of a particularicountry.

Thus, having previously touched base with local bankers anà

industrialists

would have the advantage of thier "

personal advice in matters relating to any specific sub.

sequent projects.

The countries that would seem to offer the most pro

Ising opportunitles for l

Jare PERU, CHILE, ARGENTINA.

URUGUAY, BRAZIL and VENEZUELA. Fortunately, we have already

established certain minimal tles with most of these countries.

but it would be best for

himself to become personally

2) Lodging, food and minimal entertainment'

expenses - about $35 dally per person il

Total for each person would be about $630.

3) Miscellaneous expenses (oab fares to and fron

the majority of the discussion i

The trip to Central America and CIA/DO

relations with

The following points of Interest were gleaned in

this period.

Jis a highly-trained promoter who is coldly reserved

and capable. He seems to be generally pleased with TICHSORi and

his capabilities for serving the firm as legal advisor, contact man,

and unofficial economic consultant on economic matters.

b. TICHBORN likes his cover company,

Itself.

and the work

If let alone, would use 100% of TICHBORN's time.

When he brought this up, L

Jused it as a starting place for briefing

on the general nature of TICHBORN's functions of the past.

was told that he would need TICHBORN for "research activities"

in addition to any use involving special trips to Latin America.

He

was told we would need 50% or more of TICHBORN's time to carry

out these activities.

It was pointed out to him that because of the

nature of TICHBORN's services, we would have to insist that he be

available for immedlate use and hence could not be on any long-range

_projects which would be difficult to drop.

accepted

these limitations without visable annoyances or objections.

Tichborn says his office cover is good and there are no

indications that be is not accepted for what he purports to be.

within the office.

2. After leaving

subjects were discussed:

we went to dinner where the following

pointed out clearly that he was 'the boss" and responsible

for TICHBORN's operational utilization.

TICHBORN was told that

Jis responsible for the

commerclal setup. There appeared to

be no doubt in his mind as to who calls the shots.

b. TICHBORN was told of our need for an experienced Latin

American speciallst who could handle political action research on key

issues in certain countries. He was also told of our interest in possible

CA covert action advisory tasks.

Our need for someone able to make!!

meaningíul interpretive analyses was explairied in some detail and

examples of probable areas and issues were presented. TICHBORN

said he had no special experlence in content analysis or survey analysis

techniques.

However, he was apparently very much interested In the

Idea. He said that he would get the book suggested on content analysis.

He will check into the availability of the Dominican Republic papers

mentioned and let_

know by 5 November If they can be had in New

York City. He was requested to approach the problem along the general

following lines: Analyze the Bosch anti-government statements for

indications of whom he is trying to reach, how, and for what reason

(since June 15). Similarly analyze the Balaguer statements and determine:

1) Influences the news media is having on his public image.

2) Where and how could he strengthen this image.

3) What lasues should be raised or surpressed.

It was suggested that the try to get issues of El Carlbe and Listin Dlarlo.

3.

initial Impressions of TICHBORN were as follows: He la very

intelligent and in addition is "sharp". He has a professionally smooth and

friendly manner.

Re is a natural politican. He is an "operator" and will

collaborate very closely and enthusiastically so long as there is real benefit

in it for him.

He is probably sensitive to his Mercai-American ancestory as

indicated by his obvlous annoyances (albeit presented jokingly) at the fact that!

be has not been invited out to lunch by any members of

company

in the six weeks be has worked there.

He is probably not a detalled man

and is impressed by social position and wealth and consequently likes to!

function on a high level. Although there is no real reason to belleve that

TICHBORN may see another career ahead, L

•feels there is a possibility

that L

will try to hire him for his company or he may make contacts:

in New York City which could lead to his getting a non-ClA job.

Although TICHBORN painted a rather bleak pieture of the possible

resulte of the eloction,

his comments concerning the situation

Project LICOLIC has been renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 in

the amount

$19,000 as requested.

This approval was effective

As you are aware there has been a good deal of discussion

here concerning

TICHBORN's operational activities and how he might

best contribute to the overall objectives of the Station.

would be considered hencerorth as a full time Station asset and

attention would be given to gaining maximun value from his continued

be noted that this

the condition that ".. prior to the end of the current fiscal

year (1966), adequate cover is found to afford TICHBORN not only

the needed mobility and safeguards for his work in behalf of the

Station, but also for his possible third country political

action assignments.

In addition, the following recommendation

was made in the event Project LIREAM should not be renewed & which

reached to approve Protect LIRAM also

If this turns out

to be the case we would recommend that TIChBORN be reassigned to

another area (suggest ZRKETAL) under the. type of cover (e.&. JATUBA)

which would offer hin the needed mobility and protection for area-

wide political action

assignnents.

the latter point sbould be kept in

•".

Needless to say, although

mind as a last alternative in

any decision regarding TICHBORN's continued relationship with this

Agency,

the Branch believes that the LIRFAN publication hag

proved

and has a good chance to gain acceptance and expand its

Inflvence throughout the hemisphere.

This being the case, and

as Station plang for expanding TICHBORN'g activity within

Mexico

take form, we hope his contribution to KUBARK objectivea in Mexico

and throughout Latin America will become more substantial and

recognized.

As a matter of infornation, Headquarters would appreciate

TICHBORN preparing a summary of his present cover situation, par

ticularly his

appreciation of his present residence and work

status in Mexico, and his estinate of what the future holds for

him in this regard.

Further, we would appreciate any indication

the Station may have concerning TICHBORN's personal plans in regard

to bis continued residence in Mexico and his future rei:tionship

with KUBARK.
