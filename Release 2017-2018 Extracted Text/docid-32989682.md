Re Bureau letter, 8/25/67.

The following information in regard to the

Nation of Islam is set forth for considerationk the

Bureau:

T, Fedatin

•It is noted that the Nation of Islam (NOI)

requests $12.00 weekly dues from each member in the

NYC area. Each member is also requested to purchase

150 copies of "Muhammed Speaks" newspaper per week

from the local Mosque at a price of $24.00. If the

member is able to sell all 150 copies at 20 cents each,

he is able to net $6.00 for himself.

Thus, esch

participating Nol member must turn in approximately

$90.00 in paper money plus $40.00 per monüh in dues

to Mosque #7, NYC.

This represents a total of $144.00

from each member. With approximately 500 people in

NOI contributing dues and paper money each week, the

NYC Mosque is able to take in approximately $72,000.00

each month.

Add to this the regular collections which are

taken up each Sunday, Wednesday and Friday nights, plus

the Savicrs: Day collection for which each member

expected to contribute $100.00. In addition, the

restuarants, bazaars and bakeries all contribute money

to the Mosque.

Admittedly, a good portion of this money

eventually finds its way

to ELIJAH MUHAMMAD in Chicago;

however, it is felt that the leaders of the NYC Mosque

take care of themselves before any funds are sent to

MUHAMMAD .

Three

of the leading officers of the NYC

Mosque who are

FARRAKHAN is reported::

to have expressed hostility towards the fBI.

he attended Winston-Salem Teachers College and earned his

MACEO OWENS, born 12/21/31, Cleveland, Ohio,

has

the full-time position as Secretary of the NOI Mosque

#7. He resides at 2354 95th Street, East Elmhurst,

Queens, New York. He married RENTHA BROOKS in 1954 and

served in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1954. Prior to

coming into the NOI, he was a musician in a small dance

band.

On 5/20/58, he refused to be interviewed by

the FBI.

As: Secretary of the NOI,

his main duty is

the administration of financial matters.

From July 1,

1965, through December 30, 1966, MACEO OWENS cashed

checks which were made out to Cash at the Manfacturers.

Hanover Trust Company, 67 West 125th Street, NY, NY, in

the amount of $511,835.00. OWENS drives a 1967 Imperial

automobile and he has been assigned FBI Number 121369D.

JOSEPH GRAVITT aka Captain Joseph X. Gravitt

resides at 2342 102nd Street, Corona, Queens,

New York,

and

is employed as Fruit of Islam (FOI) Captain in

Mosque #7.

He is also in charge of the FOI of the

entire Eastern Seacoast area.

GRAVITT was born 5/6/2'7,

in Detroit, Michigan,

and served in the U.S. Army in

1946 and 1947. He had been second in command to MALCOLM X

at Mosque #7 and was formerly in charge of all NOI restaurants

in the NYC area.

In August, 1967,

GRAVITT refused to cooperate

with Bureau agents.

He drives a 1907, four-door Buick

sedan.

GRAVITT, who was formerly employed as a cook,

has been assigned FBI Number 818163B.

He has been

known to point to the American flag and state

"This

is your enemy".

tigo. co..

It is obvious that FARRAKHAN, OWENS and GRAVITT

are living well on the NOI dues and other funds supplied

to them by the NOI members in NYC. It is felt that an

effort should be made to enlighten the NOI membership

as to how well their leaders live on the hard-earned

cash of the followers.

If it can be pointed out to the

membership that they are being swindled by these men, it

woald undoubtedly cause the NOI leaders a great deal of

concern and might even shake the foundation of the organiza-

tion.

It could cause the leaders to feel less secure wher

the membership has some knowledge of the economic benefit:

the leaders receive in the form of automobiles, homes, and

other benefits.

•g'?

To date, the NYO has been unable to make a

penetration into the top leadership of the NOI in NY,

as far as informant development is concerned. Some

penetration of the top leadership might occur when

their economic security is jeopardized; when funds

and

salaries are diminished and the NOI itself is threatened.

Efforts must be made to shake the confidence of the

membership in their leaders.

The information that ample NOI funds are

available to the leaders of the NoI must be made known

to individual NOI members.

In order to make this information known to

the members, the NYO has prepared the following:

A large comic-book type publication made up

to ridicule, the leaders. This book depicts FARRAKHAN,

OWENS and GRAVITT, who is commonly known as Captain

JOSEPH, living the good life, having good homes, big

cars and wearing fine suits.

It is felt that this type

publication would be an effective method of securing

initial interest and would appeal to a wide, a generally

uneducated

audience.

• 1?01:11

The publication would be mailed in unmarked

envelopes, purchased locally and would be sent to 36

members

of the NOI who are on the Security Index of

the NYO. It would also be mailed to a selective number

of 237 other individuals in the NYC area whose names

have appeared on membership records of the NOI. These

latter individuals reportedly joined the organization In

1963 and 1964 and in all probability many of them are

still members or have close friends in the organization.

When the membership receives

the publication,

it can reasonably be assumed that it will cause some of

them to start thinking and begin

asking questions concerning

the leadership. They may become disenchanted in the

organization,

cause others to be disillusioned and perhaps

future membership might also be reduced.

It is also to be noted that FARPAKHAN, OWENS and

When this publication is disseminated to

the membership, it could cour? these above three

individuals to feel that the literature was made up

by

other NOI leaders in the NY area who desire

to get rid of these three individuals and takeover the

NOI in NY for themselves.

that the dissemination of this publication will result

in internal strife, distrust and disorder within the NOI

itself.

Therefore, Bureau authority is requested to

place the above described counter-intelligence device

into effect.

If. approved, the Bureau is requested to

have made up at the Bureau 273 conic-book type publications

which can be anonymously mailed to the membership.

The

actual size of these publications is being left to the

discretion of the Bureau.

The NYO will insure that steps will be taken so

that this mailing cannot be traced as originating from

the FBI.

The Bureau will be advised of any tangible results

which might occur from this action and recommendations

will also be forwarded for appropriate follow-up counter

intelligence action.

Re.:

COUNTERINTELIIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS

New York has prepared a cartoon-type leaflet in

rough-draft form pointing out how NOI leaders live well off the

membership's money. New York recommends this leaflet be

prepared in final

form by the Exhibits section, 273 copies

be made and mailed anonymously to 36 members of the NOI who

are on the Security Index and to 237 members who joined the

NOI as shown on a 1964 membership list.

The mailing would be

made in commercially purchased envelopes to protect the

Bureau.

Attached for the Exhibits Section is a work order

and a sample pamphlet furnished by New York. Minor changes

have been made in the pamphlet to conform to NOI terminology.

The pamphlet will be reduced in size to facilitate mailing.

ACTION:

That this memorandum be routed to the Exhibits

Section for preparation of 273 copies of the pamphlet and

thereafter New York be authorized to mail them anonymously

to NOI members in New York.

being submitted for an office with the number or black

nationalist proups that your office has.

New York should

innediately review iis Counterintelligence Program for the

purpose of developing inaginative counterinteiligence

suggestions.

New York has numerous black nationalist

grOLDs

that should be the target of concentrated counterintelligence

action.

The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the

Black Panther organization, the Revolutionary Action Movement

and the American Mau Mau,

are but four examples of extrenist

groups that should receive counterintelligence attention

a continuing basis. The leaders of these groups, including

dames Forman, Charles 37X Morris and Herman Ferguson should

all be considered for counterintelligence action whother they

are under surveillance or not.

Obviously, any counterintelli

gence action recommended should be such that it cannot be

traced to this Bureau.

Thus a special status or a person

awaiting couxt action is not usually relevant to this program.

The Bureau is following this matter closely to insure

that New York fullills iis responsibilities in this area.

it

is important to use every possible technique to disrupt and

neutralize the extremist black nationalists.

In April the NYO mailed 273 copies of a comic

book publication to members of the NOI in the New York area.

This publication suggested to the membership that the

leaders of the NOI in the New York area were stealing

dues and paper money contributed by the membership. It

was hoped that the dissemination of this publication would

result in internal strife, aistrust and aisorder within

the NOI Itself.

At a NOI meeting held on 5/3/68, Minister HENRY X

said that there was talk going around that high officials

like Minister FARRAKHAN and Captain JOSEPH were not turning

in all the money and this information was passed on to the

main office in Chicago.

At a NOI meeting held on 6/9/68, secretary AUBREY

read a letter from Chicago advising all members to get a

receipt for money they turn in. If they did not get a receipt

from Chicago it indicates that someone did not turn in the

• money.

The fact was made clear that the person who did not

turn in the money will be dealt with by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

Later it was revealed at an NOI affair that the

• Supreme Captain from Chicago was coming to New York to

investigate the possibility that some high officials of the

New York NOI were not turning in all the money to ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

(LA COSA NOSTRA)

Re Detroit airtel dated 3/25/68, captioned

"CIP" and Bureau letter to Detroit, dated 4/3/68,

captioned as above.

The Detroit Office has carefully scrutinized

the information contained in referenced Bureau letter

indicating that all Negro numbers men in Detroit are

being forced to contribute money to the black power

movement in Detroit.

Referenced letter further indicates that

• the nationalistic spirit among the Negro numbers

house operators has risen and many have become

followers of Reverend ALBERT B: CLEAGE, JR., the

best known black militant in Detroit.

However, to date Detroit has been unable

to devise any feasible counterintelligence technique

which would be susceptible of widening the breach

between the La Cosa Nostra and the Negro numbers

operators.

Detroit suggests that an anonymous letter

containing a black hand and inscribed thereon the

"Watch Out!!" be mailed to Reverend CLEAGE.

It is felt that if CLEAGE receives such a letter he

will assume that the Italian hoodlum element was

responsible for this letter, report this to the Negro

numbers operators, and thereby cause them to further

resent the Italian

hoodlum element.

It is also possible that CLEAGE

may become extremely frightened upon receipt

of this letter and sever his contact with the Negro

numbers men in Detroit and might even restrict

his black nationalist activity or leave Detroit.

It is felt that such a letter could be

mailed to CLEAGE without the Bureau being

the proposed counterintelligence action will not

be taken without prior Bureau authority.

There are currently two Black Nationalist groups

in the Houston Division, i.e., Houston SNCC and Houston NOI

Mosque No. 45..

There are approximately 15 current active

SNCC members and the NOI membership at Houston is estimated

at approximately 60 persons.

The SNCC group presents the

greatest potential for violence, as their members and their

leaders lean towards violence in. achieving Negro goals by

any means.

The NOI, while active, does not appear to be

violence-prone; however, the minister tenches

• that if mem-

bers are provoked by the

white man, the white man should be

killed.

Those individuals on the Houston Rabble Rouser

Index include LEE OTIS JOHNSON (SNCC), E. D. KIRKPATRICK

(SCLC), STANLEY WAYNE WRIGHT (proposed) (SNCC), JOHNNIE

WESLEY MORRIS (SNCC), RAYMOND WATLINGION (proposed) (NOI).

STANLEY WAYNE WRIGHT - Treasurer of Houston SNCC,

is currently a good target for counterintelligence action as

money is of utmost importance to the SNCC group.

WRIGHT iS

reported to be the one SNCC member who could successfully

embara on a guerrilla warfare program.

JOHNNIE WESLEY MORRIS is one of the original

organizers of SNCC and is a believer in the general ideolo-

gies advocated by STOKELY CARMICHAEL and RAPP BROWN. He has

participated in various demonstrations in Houston.

RAYMOND WATLINGTON, the Houston NoL Minister, is a

teacher of "hate the white man"

and advocates killing the

white man if he provokes the Muslim members.

Money is

WATLINGTON's primary objective and counterintelligence along

these lines could possibly be effected.

3.

Houston Division considers Houston SNCC and Houston

NOI as possible targets for counterintelligence action.

leaders of these groups are also considered targets and the

primary avenue which offers the most potential is attacking

the financial structure of the groups.

4.

As the Bureau is aware, Houston has

recently ob-

tained copies of all the SNCC records in Houston and these

recoras contain information concerning financial contributors.

The identities of these contributors present an excellent

avenue for counterintelligence.

Specific proposals will be

made by separate communication.

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

• ReBuTelCall to me 3/12/68, and BuRad 3/21/68.

I have considered this matter, discussed it with

appropriate agent and supervisory personnel of the Mobile

Office and the following is proposed as a counterintelligence

move on KING's Washington Spring Project.

KING has quite a following In and around the Selma,

Ala. area and has appeared recently in Selma on one occasion

at the church of Reverend I. I. ANDERSON, who, at the time of

KING's appearance, was running for mayor of Selma.

ANDERSON

was tentatively endorsed by KING and was subsequently defeated

in his race for mayor of Selma.

Reverend FREDERICK DOUGLAS REESE, whO 1s head of

the Dallas County Voters League and is quite influential among

the Negro community in the selma area, did not endorse ANDERSON

for mayor and informed sources indicate he more or.less..con-

tributed to the defeat of ANDERSON:

REESE has been known to

make derogatory remarks concerning KING and was allegedly

miffed that KING did not advise him, REES, Of his, KING's,

contemplated visit to Selma.

In view of the above, lt is felt that if some

method can be devised whereby REESE can be advised of certain

Items relative to the Washington Spring Project, he would take

action to discourage individuals from participating therein.

It is not belleved that REESE could be contacted

by a Bureau Agent, although he has on occasion furnished us

information which has proven to be reliable.

--

It 1s, therefore, proposed that an anonymous letter

"be directed to REESE at his

home address, 1566 Range, Selma,

Alabama

36701, wherein it is called to the attention of REESE

that KING is merely using the Negroes of the Selma area for

his own personal aggrandizement; that he is not genuinely

Interested in their welfare, but only in their donations; that

In all probability the individuals going to Washington for

the Spring Project will be left stranded without suitable

housing of food. The letter should also play up the possibili

ty oi violence,

particularly the fact that although CARMICHAEL

and BROWN of SNCC have a so-called gentlemens' agreement with

KING not to take over this action, there exists a strong

possibility that such will occur.

There is also the possibili-

ty of RAM and NOI taking over the project since it lacks

organization and direction.

at rection.

The letter should also point out

that KING was in Alabama on about 3/21/68, and did not make

his schedule in the Selma and adjoining counties area, which

was another indication that KING was talking out of both sides

of his mouth.

It Is felt that this letter should be mailed from

either Washington or Baltimore since, if the letter 1s mailed

from anywhere in the south, REESE may feel it is the work of

the Klan or some other racist group.

It is felt that Baltimore

would probably be the best since a letter from Washington would

: indicate the possibility of the government doing this.

Simultaneous with mailing the letter from Baltimore,

It Is proposed that a copy of the letter to REESE, together

with a cover letters.

be mailed to ROSWELI FALKENBERRY, Editor

• and Publisher, Selma Times-Journal, Selma, Alabama.

letter should

indicate that attached was a

REESE and that he, FALKENBERRY, might want to contact REESE

relative to REESE's receipt of the letter and what it said.

The thought behind this is to give FALKENBERRY a

chance to interview REESE concerning reçeipt of the letter

and thereby create a news story which could legitimately be

published and read by the Negro community in the selma area.

It is known that the Selma Times-Journal has a large circula-

tion among the Negro community in Dallas and adjoining counties

and has taken a rather liberal attitude In connection with

civil rights movements.

By handling as above, we would eliminate the

possibility of these rumors being attributed to the FBI.

1s almost impossible to disillusion him.

It is also felt that some method of getting an

article in the

"Southern Courier" along the lines of the above

would have

a discouraging effect on the Negro community in

and arouna Montgomery, Ala., since the Courier is very widely

read.

Consideration is being given to the method of accom-

set forth above and advise.

DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO

Martin Luther King, during the sanitation workers'

strike in Memphis, Tennessee, has urged Negroes to boycott

downtown white merchants to achieve Negro demands. On 3-29-68

King led a march for the sanitation workers.

Like Judas leading

lambs to slaughter King led the marchers to violence, and when

the violence broke out, King disappeared.

The fine Hotel lorraine in Memphis is owned and

patronized exclusively by Negroes but King didn't go there

•from his hasty exit.

Instead King decided the plush Holiday

Inn notel, white owned, operated and almost exclusively white

patronized, was the place to "cool it."

There will be no

boycott of white merchants for king, only for his followers.

Kenneth John Hatson is the editor of a violent

It is recommended Watson's black

nationalist background be exposed through cooperative news

sources on a confidential basis by the Crime Records Division.

•Watson was formerly active in Detroit, Michigan,

in the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a black nationalist

Chinese communist criented group.

In 1967, Watson was a key

figure in the establishment of a black revolutionary newspaper

entitled, 'Inner City Voice," and has been editor of this

newspaper since its inception. Editions of this paper have

contained highly inflammatory and obscene articles and articles

Instructing in guerrilla warfare and how to make a bomb, prin- /

cipally for the purpose of sabotage.

It was recently learned that Watson has been

named editor of the Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan,

daily newspaper, "The South End," and he has indicated he intends

to use this media as a vehicle to further the black man's

revolution. This newspaper is supported by the University and

has a $100,000 budget.

After his election as èditor, he

appointed Harry, Wesley Clark, a Negro, as coeditor without the

approval of the Student Faculty Council or the Staff.

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE:

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

Watson has been experiencing difficulty in

getting the "Inner City Voice" published and, in fact, was

unable to put out the May issue due to the refusal of union

members and reputable printers to print such "trash." The

difficulties along this line were caused at least in part by

a program of our Detroit Office of bringing to the printer's

attention the true facts concerning the "Inner City Voice."

Exposure of Watson's background could influence

public. and University officials to have him removed from his

editorial position or at least limit his effectiveness through

close supervision by these officials. Since legitimate daily

newspapers are not being published in Detroit at the present

time, the exposure should be through the use of a national

magazine, if possible and feasible.

ACTION:

Attached for approval is a blind memorandum

•containing pertinent background data concerning Watson. If

approved, this nemorandum should be forwarded to the Crime

Records Division for appropriate referral to a cooperative

news media source.

KENWITH JOIN WATSON

Watson was formerly active in Detroii, lichigan, in

the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAil), a black nationalist

Chinese communist oriented group. He, along with General

Gordon Baker, Jr., acinowledged leader of the Rall, was

instruental in the fornation of the fox and Wolf Club, a

rifle club controlled by nenbers of that group. In 1967,

Watson was a key figure in the establishuent of a Datroit

newspaper entitled 'inner City Voice." Watson has been its

editor since its inception and editions of the paper have

contained highly inflamatory and obscene articles, as vall.

as articles instructing in guerrilla varfare and how to make

a bomb, principally for the purpose of sabotage. lie has

recently been unable to obtain printers to print the "inner

City Voice," due to the fact that the union members object

to printing such material.

Watson was recently elected editor of "The Souch

End," the Wayne State University daily neuspaper.

Hatson

Indicated in the June 4, 1968, edition of "The South End"

on page four, that the editors intend "to double up on the

• pressures to

bring down the old, crumbling, oppressive

• American --." He expressed the hope "you choose the side

of the revolution, because, in the words of Rap Brow, 've

will win without a doubi.""

'"The South End" operates on a $100,00Q budget from

Wayne State University: Watson has also indicated that he

wants to set up a corporation to print the University news-

paper, as well as other student and comunity publications.

Attached are copies of four issues of the "Inner

City Voice" which vividly shows its revolutionary nature and

copies of three issues of "The South End" showing Watson's

election and his editorial policy.

Operations Under Consideration

It was learned on 8/23/68, that the University

of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.,

financing the attendance

of ten members of the Black Action Society, a campus approved

student organization, to attend the Third National Conference

on Black Power to be

held at Philadelphia, Pa., 8/29 - 9/1/68.

This appears to be an excellent counterintelligence target

in view of the fact the University of Pittsburgh is a state

related school using state funds and other canus approved

organizations are not known to have received similar financial

assistance.

The propriety of using state funds for such a

purpose appears questionable.

It is realized that a

counterintelligence operation involving this matter will not

be in sufficient time to prevent or affect attendance of

these individuals at the Black Power Conference; however,

it is considered possible for a counterintelligence operation

being effective in preventing use of school funds in the

future. for a similar project.

EDWARD DONALD ELLIS, Head of the United Black

Front in Pittsburgh, Adult Advisor to the Organizers and

an agitator Index subject, is publicly known as a Black

Nationalist. ELLIS has a white wife, although he is

separated from her, and it is being considered that an

avowed Black Nationalist with a white wife could be a

logical target in a counterintelligence operation, probably

by use of a "letter to the editor" to a local newspaper.

Tangible Results

In connection with previous Bureau aproval

to conduct a counterintelligence operation, to attempt to

prevent Unity, Inc., from receiving a $150,000 grant from the

Mellon Fouration, a source at the Mellon Foundation las

utilized. Unity, Inc., did not receive a grant from the

Mellon Foundation although Canon JUNIUS CARTER, one of the

founders of Unity, Inc., received a Mellon Foundation Grant

of $33,000 and it is considered

money

l possible that some of this

was utilized by Unity, Inc.

It can be stated with

certainty that Unity,. Inc.,

did not receive a grant

from

the Mellon Foundation because of this counterintelligence

operation.-

Unity, Inc., is now defunct and has been

replaced by an organization known as

Forever Action Together

(FAT) .

The same individuals are involved with FAT as were

involved with Unity, Inc.

To date FAT has not requested a

it will do so.

that FAT is the successor to Unity, Inc., and that the same

Prior Bureau authority was granted to

utilize a Racial Liaison Source in a

counterintelligence

operation designed to curtail use of Presbyterian Church

furs in irresponsible racial projects which are actually

worsening racial conditions and possibly contriuting

to

the threat of racial violence.

This effort has been

moderately successful in that it is known three individual

Presbyterian churches have refused to further financially

support Pittsburgh Presbytery until some reason is applied

to the use of church funds in racial matters.

the

number of churches influenced to date is small, it is

considered the ultimate effect of this effort will be

very beneficial.

Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

WILLIAM ASHBY HADEN, President of the United

Movement for Progress,

Agitator Index subject, and an

inspoken advocate of militant violence in the

past, was

almost singlehandedly responsible for the removal of a

Planned Parenthood Association (PPA) Office in the Homewood-

Brushton Section of Pittsburgh, a predominately Negro area.

HADEN accused the PPA of black genocide, referred to PPA

efforts as "death in a douche bag" and reportedly threatened

riots and bombings if

anyone tried to operate a birth control

project in the area.

A group of about seventy Homewood-Brushton

women banded together and publicly opposed LADEN and his

position on the PPA and stated that HADEN did not speak

for the women of the area.

Under the female onslaught,

HADEN backed down and the PPA returned to Homewood-Brushton.

WILLIAN ASHBY FADEN, President o1

the United

Movement for Progress, Agitntor Inder subjeci, and an

unspoken advocate oi militant violence in the

past, was

almost singlehandodly responsible for the removal of a

Planned Parenthood Association (PPA) Office in the Homewood -

Brushion Section of Pittsburgh, a predominately Negro area.

HADeN accused the PPA of black genocide, referred to PPA

efforts as "death in a douche bag" and reportedly threatened

riots and bombings if

anyone tried to operate a birth contro!

project in the area.

A group of about seventy Homewood-Brushton

Women banded together and publicly opposed LADEN and his

position on the PPA and stated that INDEN did not speak

fos the women of the area.

Under the female onslaught,

HADEN backed down and the PPA returned to Homewood-Brushton.

PURPOSE:

To advise of counterintelligence results that

kept black nationalist extremist group from receiving

19150,000 grante

BACKGROUND:

Unity Incorporated operated a black power center

in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which included a proposed

target range in the basement. The leader of the group

was in possession of several pistols. The group applied for

a $150,000 grant from the Mellon Foundation in Pittsburgh.

The Pittsburgh Office has an established source

at the Mellon Foundation and recommended advising him of

the true nature of Unity Incorporated. This was approved.

RESULTS:

Pittsburgh advised that as a result of this

counterintelligence operation Unity Incorporated did not

get the $150,000 grant from the Mellon Foundation.

In

addition, Unity Incorporated is now defunct.

Re Miami letter, 10/3/68 and Bulet, 11/8/68.

Referenced Miami letter sets forth a suggestion

for the Counterintelligence Program and enclosed two copies

of a letter Miami proposed to send ELIJAH MUHAMMAD regarding

extra-marital activities of the Minister of Mosque 29.

The Bureau advised by referenced Bureau letter

that a similar program had just been approved for another

office and

sugscotcd Miami's request be resubmitted in 60.

days if conditions warrant.

The Minister of Mosque 29 continues to have

difficulty with some members of that Mosque, particularly

the former Captain, SAMUEL SAXON, who had been expelled from

the NOI and who is now currently acting as Minister of a

NOI group at It. Lauderdale, Florida.

Information has been received from informants that

both the Minister and SAXON blame each other for attempting

to undermine their authority within the tol and it is evident

that both wish to see the other expelled from the NoI.

This, together with previous rumored extra-marital

activity on the part of the Minister would certainly have

the effect of

weakening the Minister's position within the

organization.

There is no reason to believe that the submission

of this letter at this time would cause any embarrassment

It is not yet known what future plans are held

It is also not known spec-

Mosque #29.

It was known that there had been complaints

about Minister EARL by members of Mosque #29. It appears,

however, that the counterintelligence letter submitted by

the Miami Office may very well have some effect in the

removal of EARL as minister of the Miamì

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

For the information of the Bureau, reliable informants

of the San Diego Division have reported that the Black Panthers

who were arrested recently in the Los Angeles Division while

members have absolutely no idea what prompted their arrest.

The general consensus of opinion is that the arrest resulted

from a routine shakedown.

In view of the fact that WALTER WALLACE, current

leader of the BPP in San Diego, subject of San Diego file

100-14236, was also in Los Angeles at the time of the arrest

but was not himself arrested, the following Bureau permission

is requested:

It is requested that an anonymous telephone call be

placed to DAVID COMBS, current number two man of the BPP in

San Diego, advising him that the arrest took place as a result

of information furnished to the Los Angeles Police Department

by WALTER WALLACE.

It will also be indicated to COMBS

that

the reason for WALLACE's action is due to the fact that

WALLACE is becoming fearful that COMBS is acquiring too much

power within the party and is attempting to take over WALLACE'S

position of leadership.

For the additional intormation of the Bureau,

when COMbs returned to san Diego trom his continement in

Los angeles, Friday, 2/7/69, he lound laLlaR WaLLaCe sleeping with

his, COMBS,

girlfriend.

This has caused some consternation

on the part of several

BPP members and the above requested

action would undoubtedly further the split between WALLACE,

COMBS, and the party.

Informants also report that BETTY HORNE, San Diego

157-672, spent the night with WALTER WALLACE a short time ago.

It has now been reported that BETTY HORNE is presently

ill as a result of a

miscarriage.

It is felt that the time is

very opportune to send the anonymous letter to TOMMY HORNE

as requested in San Dingo letter to the Director 1/31/69.

It is therefore requested that Bureau consideration of this

request be afforded expeditious attention.

prepared for mailing. Reactions from-the San Diego area

are just beginning to come in and will appear in Section III

this

letter.

Repercussions are still being noted concerning:

WALLACE's confrontation by SYLVESTER BELL and JOHN HARVEY.

Attempis are still being made by the California State Attorney

Géneral's office to have

WALLACE's parole revoked and this situation

1s being very closely followed.

TANGIBLE RESULTS

On 3/5/69, DAVID COMBS, San Diego 157-558, was

returned

"to Chino. Prison to begin serving a one to five year

sentence.

The Los Angeles Police Department was advised of

the sentence and immediately placed a hold against COMBS

stemming out of his 1/24/69 arrest in that city.

This hold

will preclude COMBS being sent to an honor farm or released

•on parole prior to the completion of his entire sentence.

A felony warrant charging TOMMY HORNE, San Diego

157-690, with being a convicted felon in possession. of a

firearm,

was obtained at Los Angeles by thesan Diego office

Öf the State Attorney General on 3/7/69. This warrant was

obtained as a direct result of HORNE having been arrested in

Los Angeles on 1/24/69 on information furnished through

the Counterintelligence Program concerning the fact that the -

Black Panthers were travelling to los Angeles and were armed.

On 3/10/69, HORNE was arrested by the warrant

obtained by the State Attorney General's office with the

assistance of the San Diego Police Department. In addition to

the arrest of HorNe, an individual who has thus far been

unidentified and who was in the house at the time, was

arrested for possession of marijuana.

In addition, and of prime importance, is the fact

that at the time of the arrest a briefcase vas confiscated

and determined to contain what appear to be the entire

San Diego Branch of the BPP records.

These records were

apparently the property of WALTER WALLACE who has been staying

at the lIORNE residence.. The records were immediately made

55290 DooId:32989682 Page 109

## Page 110

SD 100-14192

available to the San Diego Office.

A cursory review of the

records reflect that notes of WALLACE and many other officers

-0f the. BPP are contained therein.

These include private

-notes of WALLACE, conversations WALLACE has had with other.

members ot the party including KENNY DENiON, weekly reports

submitted by BPP officers, lists of BPP officers in san Diego

and

numerous other cities,

and letters exchanged between various

BPP

offices.

As a

result,

the local

. San Diego authorities

are presently seeking felony warrants for the arrest of

WALTER WALLACE and KENNY. DENMON.

At the present time the records are being very

carefully reviewed and will be reported in the first BPP

-letterhead memorandum after completion of the review.

At the same time the felony warrant was

obtained concerning

- TOMMY HORNE, a misdemeanor warrant was obtained for LARRY BAKER

in connection with and as the result of his purchase of the hand.

BAKER has

currently dropped out of sight but when he is located he will

immediately be arrested by the San Diego Police Department.

- In the eyent San Diego Office receives any information

concerning the current whereabouts of BAKER, this

information will be immediately made available

to the San Diego

Police Department.

On •1/25/69, Bureau approved anonymous telephone

call was placed to SYLVESTER BELL, BPP Lieutenant of Security,

accusing WALTER WALLACE of being a "police agent." On 3/5/69,

-BELL, along with JOHN HARVEY, approached WALTER WALLACE in

the presence of several other BPP members and told WALLACE,

"We know that either you, Larry Baker,

or Zeke Tate is a

police agent and

I can prove it." WALLACE at this time was

disturbed to the point of visible shaking and replied,

"Well then it's Baker."

" Since that time BAKER has not been seen in the

SanDiego area.

Informants have been canvassed and believe

BAKER is in hiding since having been accused of being a police

agent and believe he has gone to either the Los Angeles or

San Francisco areas.

On 3/3/69, the first cartoon, that of RON KARENGA,

was mailed to five BPP members, one FOBP member, and, two

underground newspapers, all in the San Diego area.

Re San Diego letter to the Bureau 2/27/69.

For the information of the Bureau, at the time the

five members of the Black Panther Party (BPP) were arrested in

Los Angeles, California, on information furnished under the

Counterintelligence Program, TOMMY HORNE was among those

taken into custody.

At the time of the arrest 17 rounds

of ammunition were found in HORNE's pocket.

Located behind

the front seat of the vehicle was a blue steel automatic

Beretta Pietro made in Italy.

Investigation has revealed that the weapon was

purchased by LARRY BAKER, the current Treasurer of the BPP

• in San Diego, in the company of WALTER WALLACE on 1/2/69.

As a result.

the California State Attorney General's

Office, San Diego, California, is currently attempting to obtair

a felony warrant charging HORNE, who is a convicted felon, of

possession of the weapon and a misdemeanor warrant charging

BAKER with the purchase of the weapon.

On 3/5/69, JOHN HARVEY and SYLVESTER, BELL, Who 15

Lieutenant of. Security of the BPP in san Diego, approached

WALTER WALLACE in the presence of several other BPP member's

and told WALLACE, "We know that either you, Larry Baker,

or Zeke Tate is a police agent." WALLACE was disturbed to

the point of visible shaking and replied, "Well then its Baker."

It is pointed out to the Bureau that a Bureau-approved

anonymous telephone call was placed to SYLVESTER BELL

indicating that WALTER WALLACE was a police agent.

It is

felt that the confrontation of WALLACE by BELl and HARVEY

is prinarily the result of this anonymous telephone call.

As a resuli of the anticipated arrest of BAKER on

the above warrant which he California State Atiorney General's

Office is attempting to obtain, WALLACE will appear as being

a suspected informant more strongly than ever.

Bureau authority is therefore requested to place

an anonymous telephone call. to ZEKE TATE advising TATE that

WALLACE has named him as a police agent in order to protect

his own hide.

It is also requested that authority be granted to

place another anonymous telephone call to SYLVESTER BELL

on the day that BAKER is arrested asking BELL if he had had

a chance to check the information previously furnished him

concerning WALLACE. In the same call a warning will be issued

In view of the pending arrest of BAKER and the

BACKGROUND

• Referenced LHM provides personal background of

subject, Reverend AUGUSTUS TAYLOR, JR.,

and'also disclosed

subject said he was a Black Panther and had visited HUEY

NEWTON. Since submission of that LAM, TAYLOR has written

an article for the National Catholic Reporter concerning

his visit with NEWTON. This article was subsequently re-

printed on Page 12 of the Black Panther newspaper in the

Monday, 2/17/69, edition. This article is laudatory

concerning NEWTON and makes him appear as a martyred idealist.

On 1/14/69, TAYLOR also wrote a personal letter to NEWTON

in which he expressed his admiration and

hope that they

could become closer associated.

As of the beginning of february, 1969, TAYLOR

has a television show on WSTV-IV in steubenville, Ohio,

area.

This program is broadcast on Sundays from

12:30

to

1:00 P.M. This show provides the subject with a forum for

his Black Nationalist ideas and his new left type philosophy.

The one television show observed by SA ARTHUR J. HOLDER was

primarily concerned with an attack upon the United States

defense policy, especially the possession of atomic, biological

and chemical warfare agents when a large segment of the

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the following anonymous

letter be mailed to the Manager of VSTV-TV from Steubenville,

Ohio. The letter reads as follows:

"Dear Sir:

"As long time residents of the upper Ohio Valley,

we have been

very interested in WSTV-TV as it has

such

a pervasive influence in our area. Your

station has in large part been a positive factor

in the progress of the area and your programming

has always consisted of a responsibility balance

between the national .and local events. WSTV has

always, we feel, fairly reflected the public interest.

"Frankly, the compelling reason for this

letter is

Father Taylor's program,

"The Greatest

of These."

We feel that by supporting Father

Taylor and giving him a forum for his views,

WSTV is encouraging civil disorder, violence,

and is directly leading to the undermining of the

citizens'

confidence in government, both local

and international.

"To support our charge, you need only review

some of his programs and note the importance of

many of his seemingly innoculous statements and

reflect upon them.

"We think that it behooves you, as a public

broadcasting facility, to take cognizance of Father

Taylor's activities and pronouncements

To help you

in this matter, the following information is being

brought to your

attention:

HН 55290 Do0Id:32989682 Page 160

## Page 161

CI 100-16921

"On February 17, 1969, the "Black Panther,"

the official newspaper of the Black Panther

Party (BPP), carried an article by Father Taylor

which was a cleverly disguised piece of propaganda

concerning huey Newton, who is, as you know, a

founder of the Bee. Newton was convicted by a

California court of killing a police officer. We

do not feel that a man who eulogizes Newton

should have a forum on television for the further

dissension of his views.

"The BPP calls for its members to arm

themselves, use their guns and start a revolution.

They openly claim that they will use guerrilla

tactics and overthrow the American Government.

To check on this, you need only to subscribe to

or read one issue of their newspaper.

"Can you be sure that ROBE, an organization

that Taylor belongs to locally,

chapter of the BPP? He has openly criticized

By criticizing these groups and causing people

man's interests at heart. This, you know, is false.

Will he not some day turn on you also? Is he not

now calling upon his followers to arm themselves and

create a disturbance in our schools and at our

athletic contests?

"We think it would be most illuminating for

you to determine why the trustees, and black, ot

me Phyllis Wheatley Association,

no longer allow

Taylor to use their premises for his meetings with

high school students.

We feel you should determine

who the black militant hate mongers are whom he

introduces into the community. Why has Taylor so

antagonized many of his colleagues in

• the civil

rights field?

"Thank you for your consideration in this matter."

• The

Cincinnati Division, at Steubenville, Ohio,

recognizes that it will be more effective if this informa-

tion could be given

to a personal contact at the television

station.

This is not being considered as the risk of

exposure is too great for the following reason:

There is a great deal of prostitution and gambling

in the Steubenville area and two announcers, who work for

the television station, are involved in these matters. It

..is felt that the anonymous letter technique is the more

prudent approach at this time, and

therefore it is recommended.

OBJECTIVE

It is felt that by bringing this information to

the attention of the television station, they will have to

consider its implications.

They have numerous alternatives, but it is hoped

that they will consider terminating subject's (TAYLOR'S)

contract at a suitable time after a preliminary inquiry

reveals the facts in the letter to be true.

If they do

not make an inquiry and do not consider terminating TAYLOR'S

services, it is felt that they at least will show the

letter to TAYLOR and it is felt that this will cause him

to tone down many of his statements.

FOLLOW UP

Depending upon any tangible results obtained from.

this letter, the Cincinnati Division could send the same

letter to various advertisers with a different forward,

and requesting them to withdraw their advertising from

WSTV-TV. In connection with this follow up, the Cincinnati

Division would utilize as enclosures anti-sematic statements

made by Black Nationalists.

It is recommended that the Bureau approve the

above measure to be instituted by the Cincinnati Division

at the earliest possible date.

BACKGROUND

Referenced In provides personal background of

subject, Reverend AUGUSTUS TAXLOR, OR., and also disclosed

subject

said he was a Black Panther and had visited HUEY

NEWTON.

Since submission of that LiN, TAYLOR has written

an article for the National Catholic Reporter concerning

his visit with NEWTON. This article was subsequently re

printed on Page 12 of. the Black Panther newspaper in the

Monday, 2/17/69, edition.

This article is laudatory

concerning NaVION and makes him appear as a martyred idealist!

On 1/14/69, TAYLOR also wrote a personal letter to NEWTON

in which he expressed his admiration and hope that they

could become closer associated.

As of the beginning of rebruary, 1969, TAYLOR

has a television show on WSTV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio,

area.

1:00

This program is broadcast on Sundays from 12:30 to

P.M.

This show provides the subject with a forum for

his Black Nationalist ideas an his new left type philosophy.

The one television show observed by SA ARTHUR J. HOLDER waS

primarily concerned with an attack upon the United States

defense policy, especially the possession of atomic, biological

and chemical warfare agents when a laige segment of the

population lives in poverty.

RECONENDATION

It is recommended that the following anonymous

letter be mailed to the Manager of MSTV-lY from Steubenville, .

Ohio.

The letter reads as follows:

"Dear Sir:

"As long time residents of the upper Ohio Valley,

we have been very interested in VSTV-IV as it has

such a pervasive influence in our area.

Your

station has in large pari been a positive factor

in the progress of the area and your programming

has always consisted of

a responsibility balance

between the national.and local events. WSTV has

always, we feel, fairly reflected the public interest.

"Frankly, the compelling reason for this

letter is Father Taylor's program, "The Gicatest

of These."

We feel

that by supporting Father

Taylor and giving him a forum for his views,

WSTV is encouraging civil disorder, violence,

and is directly leading to the undermining of the

citizens'

conjidence in government, both local

and international.

"To support our chaige, you need only review

some of his programs and note the importance of

many of his seemingly innoculous statements and

reflect upon them.

"He think that it behooves you, as a public

broadcasting facility, to take cognizande of Father

Taylor's activities and pronouncements.

To help you

In this matter, the following information is being

broughi to your attention:

CT 100-16921

"On February 17, 1959, the "Black Panther,"

the official newspaper of the Black Panther

Party (BPP), carried an article by lather Taylor

which was a

cleverly disguised piece of propaganda

concerning

Huey Newton, who is, as you know, a

founder of the BPP. Newton was convicted by a

California court of killing a police officer. He

do not feel that a man who eulogizes Newton

should have a forum on television for the further

- dissension of his views.

"The BPP calls for its members to arm

themselves, use their guns and start a revolution.

They openly claim that

they will use guerrilla

tactics and overthrow the American Government.

To check on this, you need only to subscribe to

or read one issue of their newspaper.

"Can you be sure that ROBE, an organization

that Taylor belongs to locally,

is not really a

chapter of the BPP? He has openly criticized

the Conmunity Action Council, COIBAT and the NAACP.

By criticizing these groups and causing people

to question

their actions and integrity, he poses

as the only individual who truly has the black

man's interests

at heart. This, you know, is false.

Will he not some day turn on you also? Is he not

now calling upon his followers to arm themselves and

create a disturbance in our schools and at our

athletic contests?

"We think it would be most illuminating for

you to determine why the trustees, all black, of

the Phyllis Wheatley Association, no longer allow

Taylor to use their premises for his meetings with

high school students.

We feel you should determine

who the black militant hate mongers are whom ne

introduces into the community.

Why has Taylor so

antagonized many of his colleagues in the civil

rights field?

"Thank you for your consideration in this matter."

The Cincinnati Division, at Steubenville, Ohio,

recognizes that it will be more effective if this informa-

tion could be given to a personal contact at the television

station. This is not being considered as the risk of

exposure is too great for the following reason:

There is a great deal of prostitution and gambling

in the Steubenville area and two announcers, who work for

the television station, are involved in these matters.

It

is felt that the anonymous letter technique is the more

prudent approach at this time, and therefore it is recommended.

OBJECTIVE

It is felt that by bringing this information to

the attention of the television station, they will have to

consider its implications.

They have numerous alternatives, but it is hoped

that they will consider terminating subject's (TAYLOR'S)

contract at a suitable time after a preliminary inquiry

reveals the facts

in the letter to be true.

If they do

nat make an inquiry and do not consider terminating TAYLOR'S

services, it is felt that they at least will show the

letter to TAYLOR and

it is felt that this will cause him

to tone down many of his statements.

FOLLOW UP

Depending upon any tangible results obtained from

this letter, the Cincinnati Division could send the same

letter to various advertisers with a different forward,

and requesting them to withdraw. their advertising from

WSTV-TV. In connection with

this follow up, the Cincinati

Division would utilize as enclosures anti-sematic statements

made by Black Nationalists.

It is recommended that the Bureau approve the

above measure to be instituted by the Cincinnati Division

at the earliest possible date.

I. BACKGROUND

DONALD WILSON JACKSON, aka Muhammed Kenyatta,

1s a Negro male, age 24, who is an independent black

extremist of the Jackson Division, who is sympathic with

'the aims and purposes of the Student Non-Violent Co-Ordinating

Committee (SNCC), the Black Panther Party (BPP) and related

extremist groups. He is presently unemployed and resides

in a private residence near the Tougaloo College campus.

Until recently, he was a Tougaloo College student, however,

he was dismissed from school for failure to pay his bills.

He is on the Jackson Division Agitator Index and is originally

from the Chester, Pennsylvania, vicinity.

• IT. RECENT ACTIVITIES

In early 1969, a warrant was issued for JACKSON

based on his attempted theft of a television set from

the Tougaloo College campus; during this attempt he was

shot at, but not hit, by students; he paid a fine and was

released regarding this matter

JN 100-980

A Black Spring Weekend was held from 4/10-13/69,

at Tougaloo College and was attended by WILLIE RICKS,

BPP Southern representative, CHICO NEBLETT, East Coast

Field Marshal of the BPP and JAMES FORMAN,

former International

Director of SNCC; activities at this weekend included, among

other things, forums on the BPP and on the Republic of

.. New

Africe

(RNA). During this weekend associates of DON

JACKSON assaulted three white professors, struck one Negro

student in the face with a pistol and conducted firearms

firing in woods in near area of the campus.

They also

generally intimidated all white students and professors

on the campus.

As a result of these activities of JACKSON and his

associates, 20 Negro Tougaloo College students met in the

college chapel and formed a Defense Committee, as of 6:00 p.ms

4/11/69. Three pistols were handed out to members of the

Defense Committee in the event JACKSON and his associates

should try to take more serious action and provoke additional

incidents on the campus.

Following the incidents previously related President

GEORGE OWENS, Negro male of Tougaloo College, placed a notice

on the school bulletin boards urging all students to remain

calm despite several incidents caused by outside agitators.

President OWENS personally contacted Jackson SNCC representative

HOWARD SPENCER, who is a Tougaloo College graduate, and

told SPENCER to tell some of JACKSON's associates who were

not students and causing trouble to "cool it."

advised during the Black Spring

Weekend that JACKSON held one marihuana party at his residence

attended by many militants and extremists and also was

distributing packets of marihuana to various weekend attendees.

During the weekend JACKSON and his associates were

frequently at odds with RNA representatives at the school.

They boycotted the RNA forum and as a protest measure fired

guns in a wooded area in an extreme area of the campus.

## Page 176

100-880

ON 100-980

The faculty and a great majority of the students

at the school were very distressed and upset with the foolish

and extremist activities of JACKSON and his associates, as

was evidenced by the forming of the Defense Committee.

Additionally, they felt that the programs of the BPP and

its representatives and associates was a program of nihilism.

III. PROPOSED COUNTERINTELLIGENCE MEASURE

It is proposed that the following letter be

typewritten on commercial paper and forwarded to DONALD

JACKSON at his Hillerest Street residence at Tougaloo,

Mississippi, bearing Tougaloo, Mississippi, postmark:

.?::

'Tougaloo College

"The deplorable activities and conduct

of you and your Black Panther brothers at the

recently completed Black Spring Weekend have

shocked the Tougaloo College conmunity into

realizing the basic errors in the intimidation

methods and nihilistic doctrines which you promote.

: Your inmature actions of discharging firearms

near the campus on Saturday afternoon, April 11,

• further alienated you and you 'outsiders' from the

spirit and tone in which all desired the BSW to

take.

Your recent involvement in various

criminal activities in and near Tougaloo College

as well as your irresponsibility in paying your

school bills while at Tougaloo College further

exemplify the inappropriateness of you, of all

people,

in any manner acting as a representative

of blacks in Mississippi or anywhere for that

matter. Your conduct and demeanor is representa-

tive of traits and habits we in our quest are

trying to rise above.

## Page 177

JN 100-980

"Accordingly, it has been determined

by solidity representative elements of the

Tougaloo College Student Body that you are

directed to remain away from this campus until

such time as your conduct and general demeanor

reach the desired level. This directive also

applies to your bringing any of your unruly

and undisciplined associates to. the campus.

"Should you feel that this is a

hollow directive and not heed our diplomatic

and well thought out warning we shall consider

contacting local authorities regarding some

of your activities or take other measures

available to us which would have a more direct

effect and which would not be as cordial as this

note.

"Tougaloo College Defense Committee"

IV. OBJECTIVE

It is hoped that this letter, if approved and

forwarded to JACKSON, will give him the impression that

he has been discredited at the Tougaloo. College campus

and is no longer welcomed there. It could discourage

him from inviting out of state extremists to visit him

and while here to speak at Tougaloo College. It may

possibly also cause him to decide to leave Mississippi

and return to his original home in Pennsylvania.

None of the above information in above

proposed letter will compromise any Jackson Division

informants.

that the Bureau is not disclosed as

the source.

Advise of any results received as a result

NOTE:

• Detroit has proposed the mailing of a disruptive

The letter will be signed, "A

to suspect a female leader of the BPP as the authoress of this

letter.

The letter questions the death of a BPP member who

is believed to have committed suicide some time ago. This

communication raises the possibility that national BPP leaders

were the cause of this so-called suicide.

We are authorizing

this communication.

There is no chance that the Bureau would

be divulged as the source and there is no chance that an

Detroit proposes utilizing the following counter-

intelligence technique as a disruptive measure within the

Detroit Black Panther Party (BPP). The counterintelligence

technique would be in the form of

an anonymous letter sent

to a representative number of Detroit BPP leaders and members.

This letter will be signed "A Concerned Sister" with the

expectation that it will cause suspicion oi JacklE stIcur, a

Detroit BPP leader, as the author of the letter. The letter

will read as follows:

"Dear Brothers and Sisters:

Who's next? You, me, who knows.

DO yOu

really believe Brother Baynham blew his brains

out.

Do you believe he shot the top of his head

off and then took the time to hide the gun in a

sate hiding place so that the pigs couldn't

find it.

The pigs call it

'suicide' and none

of the local brothers or sisters challenge this.

Who's kidding who.

Why was Brother Baynham's

rich black blood splattered all over a dirty room

in a lousy racist city.

Was this 'suicide'

and

the

"mercy killing' of one of out, other brothers in

New Haven arranged by Chief Executioneer, Hilliara.

This is especially evident in the fact that the Detroit

Detroit, feels that this situation can be

exploited by distribution of copies of the enclosed pamphlet

This pamphlet could obviously originate in

NOTE:

The notorious black extrenist group known as the

Black Panther Party has in the past utilized a Catholic

church in San Diego, California, with the assistance

of its pastor, the Reverend Frank Curran, who is at the

very least naive. Several counterintelligence proposals

have been aimed against Father Curran in an effort to

neutralize his activities. He is still assisting the BPP

and has utilized his church as a sanctuary for BPP members.

He has also alleged that the SDPD is racist and is creating

terrorism in the SD area.

He stated that he nad been

approached by one CHARLENE LANE from the BPP on 10/27/69.

She

requested space at St. Anthony's in order that the BPP could serve

free breakfast to the local children.

She said the food would be

solicited from local merchants, the BPP would serve. it and the BPP

would clean the premises after

would be recruited into the BPP, parents would be discontented with

a discontinuation of free breakfast and local merchants would be

chagrined at possibly being forcibly persuaded to give free food

Father STELTZ appeared apprehensive at the possible

repercussions of such a program and stated that he knew of no way

: to call it off at this late dete

He was advised that another Pastor, in a similar

situation, called a meeting of his Parish Council (PC) submitted

the BPP program to them and by unanimous vote the PC votea against

Father STELTZ thanked the agents for their consideration

high

school teacher, on 12/18/69 was in contact with SẢM NAPỈER,

Circulation Manager of the BPP newspaper in San Francisco.

The purpose of this

contact was to advise NAPIER the Rochester,

N.r., School System would soon be sending a check in the amount

Buffalo is submitting the following counterintelligence

proposal which, if authorized,

could possibly result in the

canceling of the subscriptions to the BPP newspaper or in

banning future subscriptions to the newspaper at taxpayers'

expense.

Further, it would focus attention on ALAN J. BARASCH,

a Black: History teacher at tast High school, rochester, so as

to deter him from imolementing black extremist literature anc

philosophy into the Black History curriculum of the Rochester,

N.X., Public School System.

The proposal would be in the form

an anonymous letter from a black educated and concerned

parent.

The letter would be mailed to appropriate responsible

I am

a salesman of used farm equipment and

machinery and I have always been noted for my honesty.

About one week ago Hunt, who said he was in

charge of the "SNICK" Club in Georgia (Carmichael's old

group), was introduced to me by a friend. Hunt said he

wanted

to buy junk farm equipment and that he would pay

the price of new equipment

for the junk.

I told Hunt that it sounded like he was crazy

and was throwing his money away. Hunt said he wasn't

crazy and that if I would just

get him titles for the junk

equipment he would give the titles to the Inter-Religious

Foundation for Community Organizing, 475 Riverside Drive,

New York City, and tell them that they represented new

eguipment.

Then your group would pay Hunt as though he

had brought brand new stuff.

Hunt said we could go 50-50 on the difference

farm land in the Knoxville, Tennessee area.

AS I

said before I was contacted by a Mr. Hunt who

- haắ this "deal" for me which went as follows:

Mr. Hunt asked me to quote him a price on a 200 acre

parcel of land in the vicinity of Morristown, Tennessee. This

land was to be used for tobacco and general farming purposes.

When I told Mr. Hunt that there was no such land available which

I could get for him he told me not to worry as he would pay

me top dollar for whatever I could sell him because his friends

did not intend to work the land anyway.

I:told Mr. Hunt I still didn't understand what his

leal was and he said to me "you think like a real nigger. You

don't know a good thing when you see it. "

de then told me that if I could get him the piece of

land for $5,000 he would tell

"the Church" it cost $50.000 ani

that he and I could split the $45,000 difference in a way that

would make us a good bit of money. Mr. Hunt told me there were

other people involved with him but he did not tell me who they

were.

I must confess that I did show an interest

in what he

had told me but I said to him I didn't understand why a Church

would want to buy land in Tennessee. He told me that he was

president of an organization that was sponsored by a group called

the Inter-Religious Foundation for Community Organizing, 475

Riverside Drive, New York City, which was really not a church,

but a bunch of Honkie and Uncle Tom Churchmen who were real

liberal with money and never asked questions.

regarding Black Panther Party and he published series of

articles concerning Black Panther Party

which is credited

with the disbandment of Black Panther Party chapter in

Mississippi.

Jackson proposed Ward be furnished information

concerning

violent nature of RNA so he could consider

publishing articles concerning it.

Jackson believes such

articles will hinder RNA recruiting activities and possibly

preclude re-establishment of RNA activities in that state.

Ward has previously been utilized in connection with

the counterintelligence program and there is no chance

of embarrassment to the Bureau in this matter.

1) BACKGROUND

The Republic of New Africa (RNA) is a black

extremist group originally established at Detroit, Michigan,

In recent months, there has been a split in leadership of

this group between two brothers, MILTON HENRY and RICHARD

HENRY. For the past couple of months, RICHARD HENRY, who

goes by the name BROTHER IMARI, has allegedly moved his

faction's headquarters to the New Orleans, Louisiana, area,

which has in the past been the headquarters for the Southern

Region of the RNA.

RNA activity in Mississippi has consisted in the

past primarily of a small RNA Consulate of three to four

members.

Consul is CAROLYN WILLIAMS of Jackson.

The RNA has been seeking to obtain land in

Mississippi, and has made several false claims in the past

that they have purchased land in Mississipi.

Within the past two weeks, BROTHER IMARI has

visited the Jackson Consulate and has indicated he is

interested in setting up an RNA office in Jacksm

with legitimate Negro figures regarding a possible site for

this conference.

He has indicated he would like to get an office

established in Jackson "before any confrontation occurs

between his group and the 'establishment' in Mississippi, as

once he is established, it will be hard for them to root him

out"'.

Within the past week, representatives of BROTHER

IMARI from New Orleans have been in the Jackson area making

contacts for the publishing of an RNA newspaper to be prepared

in Jackson and distributed in Jackson and New Orleans.

is noted that the Jackson Division has

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA

RACIAL MATTERS

This is to advise of highly successful counter-

intelligence action against the Republic of New Africa (RNA)

by Jackson, Mississippi, residents.

The RNA, a violence-prone, black extremist,

separatist organization, is split into two factions.

The

more militant faction scheduled a regional conference from

7/31/70 to 8/2/70 in Jackson where it would like to establish

a RNA group. Jackson Division was granted Bureau authority on

1/27/70 to furnish public source data concerning violent nature

Of RNA to trusted newspaper source on a confidential basis.

The source wrote an article exposing the violent nature of RNA

which appeared on front page of 7/30/70 issue of "Jackson

Daily News," the only state-wide evening newspaper in Mississippi

This publicity, the evening before the conference

began, jolted RNA leaders and Negro representatives from

Jackson were shocked to learn RNA was such a violent group.

A heated argument erupted as to what the real goals of the RNA

were and individuals from Jackson indicated they could not

support RNA if it promoted violence.

shelved and discussion was virtually confined to the newspaper

article.

The last days activities were cancelled as Negro

Masonic

Temple refused to allow RNA to use their facility due

to group's prior participation in violence as exposed in the

newspaper article.

six pigs and was brutalized by them. This dude talked real

bad and said he had killed pigs and was going to get more

Press Agents

SCIA JAMES A. WEGHSLER

On any roster of innocent victims of wartime absurdity,

Sheldon Ramsdoll deserves prominent mention

• A taienied 3&-ycar-old frec-lance photographer who served

as a press aide for Sen, Eugene 2IcCarthy during the 1508 cam-

paign, Pamsiel! subsequently associated himself with an outfit

known as "New York Press Service" headed by one Louis Salz-

. berg.

Now Rumsdell has discovered that in the performance of

his duties ior that enterprise, he was unknowingly working as

an agent for the FBI in its militant surveillunce of the neace

movement. One might says that he was so secret an agent that

he was denica ascess to his own secret.

Rcrelation of his unwitting role came as a result of Salenerg's

emergenie as a government witness in the Chicago "conspiracy"

trial of anti-mar loaders. It is now clear that the "Press Service"

sas al. Joast in part an b'CIsubsidized operation, and pictures ot

peace dconstrators taken by Ramsdcll have presumaiiy been

immortalited in the FBI's galicries of suspicious characters.

Ramsdell's conscience may be partially appeased lis

knowle! do that his labors were highly unremunartive; Salberg

kept toine; lin that money obtained from photo sales (to nes's-

papers and pico-groups) had to be used for expansion plans,

inmati, like gayment once the business prospered

Mrs, in Chienko, Salhorg has testified that his own reward

Ramsdell might be understandably uncertain as to whetlier

to laugh of weep about his own predicament.

can hardly have contributed to any serious hunan discomiort;

people who participate in peace rallies do not view themselves

as underground operatives, and their faces are continuously ex-

posed to cameras.

But he is not without anger about what he quite rightiy

regards is the misuse of press credentials by investigative agon-

cies-anil, of course, by the misuse of his own work.

"Al' that I've gotten out of this is a credibility gap," he

remarkui resteriar.

"People begin to distrust me because of

the contradio. And I begin to wonder how many press peopie

may be working for the FBI."

The ciclo oi suspicion is

It twas not a big business; there were only two others

the "staff" and, at one point, Ramsdell expressed some & acci

to a collague about Salzberg's reai involvement.

"That's funny," she associate replied. "He just warned me

about you."

Ramsdell has some: other intriguing recollections. It was not

uncommon, for example, for the service to oifer its products at

modest ices to the Cemmunist Daily World and other left-wing

publications. The photos might have been appropriately cap-

tioncd: "Courtesy of the FBI.'"

MEMO TO: National Steering Connittee

RE: The Absolute Racial Imbalance of The NSC

Having for a short time served as a member of the NSC, and

currently active in the Moratuaium Connittes - both in

Washington and New York, I find It nacessary to call attention

to certain facts overlooked or shovalled under the rug by

NMC leadership.

My understanding at the time I joined NMC was that It was to

be run

as a non-exclusionary organization - devoted to one

primary cause, the immediate

and of the frightful war in

Vietname We were not to be side-tracked into supporting

the aims of the militant left.

We ware not to be

sucked

Into protests against the govorment's trial of the Conspiracy

8 in Chicago and the like.

Our sighis were to be adjusted

at some later time when the war terminated. Or, so I

thought.

Over the past several years the Trotseyites have literally

taken control of the body proper and have repeatedly resisted

efforts to recruit black brothers into NMC leadership.

addition, they have seen fit to use the good officos of

the NMC to further their own political aspirations, nebulous

as they are.

I have been sickened - on more than one occasion - by the

promises made to the Black United Front, promises not kept,

promises made with the mouth and not the heart. The attitude

of the Steering Committee towards tha BUF was and is a

matter of disgrace.

In the maln, NMC leadership has been

no better than the racist politicans and phony liberals

who give lip service to the black conmunity and turn their

backs on any positive action.

The NMC leadership has demonstrated an appalling lack of

sensitivity towards the largest minority in the country.

If NMC 1s to survive the coming months,

the situation

must be rectified immediatoly:

Our leadership - including

the omni-present Trotskyites sid other radicals - had better

take positive steps before thoss who disagree with current

policy, and there are many. either withhold future support

or take decisive action to remova NMC leadership. It is

NOTE:

By relet, New York submitted a two-page leaflet

"Newsreel

Filns."

It is designed to ridicule

Newsrcel in particular and the New Left movement in general.

It does this by seiting forth a list of films supposedly

available at Newsreel.

The description set out for each of

The New York Office

states that lew Left has sanctified the three individuals

killed in a Mow York townhouse explosion and has accepted

homosexuals and the Women's Liberation Movement into its

ranks with studied seriousness. New Iork's leaflet would

ridicule each of these phases of the New Left movement.

Since there is no possibility of embarrassment to

the Bureau and since the leaflet would tend to divide the

New Left movenent, it is being approved.

SUBJECT:

Reference is made to New York letter dated 6/30/70.

Enclosed herewith are two copies of a two page leaflet

entitled "Newsreel Films"

, which is designed to ridicule

the "NEWSREEL" (NY 100-162668) in particular and the New

•* Left movement in general,

New York has observed a tendency on the part of

people in the Now Left to

sanctify the three individuals

killed In a "bomb factory" explosion in New York in March,

1970€

In addition, the New Left has been forced to regara

the "fight for homosexual rights" and Women's Liberation

with a studied seriousness that allows no room for humor

of any kind.

New York feels that the interjection of a little

"Black humor" into the New Left flold - as set forth in

the enclosad leaflet - might serve to further divide

the various factions and splinter groups.

It is felt

the New Left will attribute this leaflet

• to some dissentient

group fed up with the "ego trips" which characterize

Women's Liberation, Gay Llberation and the like.

Bureau authority is requested for New York to prepare

enclosed leaflet and mail anonymously to selected individuals

and organizations in the lew Left movement,

Reference is made to New York letter dated 7/31/70

Bulet 8/13/70, which authorized New York to prepare

and mail anonymously a "comic strip" aimed at

causing disruption in the Progressive Labor Party (PLP).

Enclosed for the Bureau are two copies of a letter

which New York proposes to be sent to the editor of

the PLP newspaper "Challenge-Desafio" in the near

future.

The purpose of the above letter may be seen from

the following:

Turing the period 9/24-25/70, 160 copies of the

PLP conic strip were mailed anonymously to LP members,

supporters and allied organizations. On 10/26/70,

35 accitional copies were mailed to members and officers

of Students For A Democratic Society - Worker Student

Allia-se (SDS-WISA) on a country-wide basis.

Fic 11/1/70, issue of "Challenge-Desafio", page 2,

contains an article entitled "Police Forgeries

Won't

StOp ==119

sub-titled "Cops Spend Thousands to Mis-

Print sipis Program * Mail Out Racist Cartoons and

Egg Or Nationalist Attacks * Those sing These Police

Lies

Jight To Think Where That Action Leads."

The article reports various items that have been

receird by PLP members and friends during the past

sever: weeks including a "Racist comic strip cartoon

distoring the above mentioned internal report showing

the west kind of stereotype of a black person, sent to

many zanbers and friends of PLP as well as others'.

I read with interest your article on

pointed out attempts of the pig establishment

A word of caution, however.

I an convinced

that it is a mistake to make the basic assumption

..that all such filthy devices can be laid at the

dishonored door of the pigs.

Unfortunately, there

are today in Pl disruptive elements who are not

above such tatics. I also feel that many of these

Nat'l Steering Comm. "are not police in origin?

I would suggest a little internal investigation

is in order - in fact, absolutely necessary• 1

would further suggest that PL take a good look

at the current activities of people like Epton

and others of his ilk.

They are out to destroy

the party in every respect.

I am, of course, concerned that the bosses

and their flunkies will continue to'attack our

party and the working class but they

are. the least

of our worries.

My biggest concern is the

traitors in our midst.

And, brothers, I for one

am going to help ferret them out.

a two page leaflet entitled "Newsreel Films", designed

to ridicule the "NEWSREEL" (NY 100-162668).

RXVI

Above leaflet will be mailed at the opportune time.

It is noted that (NY 6816-s) has recently reported

signs which indicate that the New York Newsreel is

involved in internal dissension.

the New York Newsreel is being taken over by a

"female collective", with most of the "old" male

leadership being thrown out of their offical positions.

2. Pending Counterintelligence Action

By letter dated 11/9/70, Bureau authority was received

•for New York to prepare and mail an anonymous letter to the

Editor of "Challenge - Desafio", the publication of the

Progressive Labor Party (PLP):

This letter was designed to

cast suspicion on former PLP leader WILLIAM EPTON, as being

the author of a "racist comic-strip" which upset PLP

leaders in September and October, 1970.

Above letter mailed by New York on 12/23/70=

3. Tangible Results

By letter dated 8/13/70, Bureau authority was received

for New York to prepare and mail anonymously a leaflet - in

the form of a comic-strip - designed to exploit a factional

dispute within the ranks of the PLP.

During the period 9/24-25/70, 160 copies of the above

•leaflet were mailed to selected individuals and organizations

active in both the New Left and PLP. On 10/26/70, 35

additional copies of this leaflet were mailed anonymously

to persons active in the PLP in the New York area.

I'he 11/1/70, issue of "Challenge - Desafio", page 2

contained

an article entitled "Police Forgeries Won't

Stop PLP", sub-titled "Cops Spend Thousands to Mis-Print

PLP'S Program # Mail Out Racist Cartoons and Egg On

Nationalist Attacks

*Those Using These Police Lies

Ought To Think Where That Action Leads".

The article reports various items that have been

received during the past several weeks by PLP members and

friends including a

"Racist comic strip cartoon distorting

the above mentioned internal report showing the worst kind

of Stereotype of a black person, sent to many members and

friends of PLP as well. as others."

New York feels the above article was forced on PLP by

the impact of the cartoon and other items. The only defense

posture left to them was to blame in print police agencies

for the distribution of such disruptive material.

obvious, however, that a certain amount of editorial

agony was involved in ?LP'S attempted refutation of the

racist charges being brought against the National Steering

Committee.

shoulders of WILLIAM EPTON.

1. Potential Counterintelligence Action

During the past quarter contact has been maintained

with(Captain GARTH WILKINSON and J. ELROY JONES, Security De-

partment., University of Utah,,

Salt

Lake City, Utah, both of

whom are Confidenfial Sources of the Salt Lake City Office,

and they have advised during this period that the University

of Utah Chapter of Students For A Democratic Society (SDS)

has held several meetings on the University of Utah Campus

but has been otherwise inactive to date.

Both were contacted

on 12/29/69 and adyised that the SDS, University of Utah

Chapter, has held only one meeting during December, 1969.

They stated these meetings have attracted very little attend-

ance by students of the University of Utah, and SDS has not

participated in any disruptive activities on the University of

Utah Campus:

Both noted they were of the opinion that the SDS

is without issues or problems with which they can gather

student backing and cause disruptions on the University of

Utah Campus.

They advised the absence of these issues has

thoroughly handicapped the University of Utah Chapter of SDS,

and they do not anticipate any problems with this organization

at the present time.

Sources of the Salt Lake City Division, who are

aware of University of Utah SDS activities, have

furnished

essentially the same information regarding SDS activities or

that campus during the past quarter as above.

The SDS Chapter

of the University of Utah has afforded the Salt Lake City Divi-

sion little opportunity for counterintelligence action, due

maiply to its inactivity.

On

12/4/69, (DWIGHT LEROY DENNIS, Confidential Source, USU, ad-

vised that a chapter of SDS is not present on the

• USU Campus.

He also alvised that the Young Socialist Alliance has not

been active during the current semester, and he does not

anticipate any problems or disruptions from this organization.

He noted that Students For A Democratic Action failed to re-

new activity on the USU Campus during the past semester, and

he does not anticipate this organization being reactivated

during the current year.

Contact will be maintained with DENNIS and other

Confidential Sources on the USU Campus so as to Insure the

securing of all information of value from a counterintelli-

gence standpoint.

Salt Lake City will continue to closely follow

activities of the University of Utah Chapter of SDS in an ef-

fort to secure all opportunities to discredit this organiza-

tion and the individual members by means of counterintelli-

gence action.

2. Pending Counterintelligence Action

None.

3. Tangible Results

The Salt Lake City Division received Bureau permis-

• sion to anonymously mail a letter previously submitted to the

Bureau to JAMES LUCIEN BEVER, Salt Lake City file 100-10534,

Bureau file 100-451807, the President of the University of

Utah Chapter of SDS, and this communication was forwarded to

BEVER on 10/3/69, the date Bureau authority was granted.

Sources of the Salt Lake City Division who attend University

of Utah Chapter of SDS, meetings reported that at an SDS meet-

ing held at the University of Utah on 10/7/69, BEVER appeared

this meeting with the above-mentioned letter which had been

anonymously forwarded to him in an effort to cause dissension

and hard feelings between the

SDS Chapter at the University of

Utah and LAURY HAMMEL, a University of Utah student leader who

had resigned his position as

a University of Utah student offi-

cer and past chairman of the Organizations Board in order to

devote time to SDS goals.

Sources advised that BEVER con-

fronted HAMMEL at this SDS meeting on 10/7/69 and indicated

he had 'received information to the effect HAMMEL was a traitor

to SDS principles and an informant for the "Feds."

Sources

advised HAMMEL was very disturbed by BEVER's remarks and at-

tempted to assure those present at this meeting that he was

indeed faithful to the SDS cause and was not an informant for

the "Feds."

It is felt his letter

was successful in creating

dissension among members of the University of Utah Chapter of

SDS and particularly in causing members of the University of

Utah SDS Chapter to have doubts about their current leader's

loyalty to SDS. It is noted sources have reported that SDS

meetings subsequent to the meeting held

on 10/7/69 have been

extremely unorganized, with members

aisagreeing on almost

everything that is brought up.

It

is felt this

letter was

successful in fomenting confusion within the University of

since it is noted this groud has been

totally practive and unable to obtain any student following at

Reairtel requests authority to use (SD 1095-R)

to spread

suspicion that Lee haymond Kellison is a police

informant and through his assistance, two arrests have

been made.

YOUr

airtel does not set out the relationship

thatSD 1095-R) has with the Message Information Center

nor how this informant could logically introduce his

suspicions of Kellison. Your communication also does not

indicate whether such a procedure could jeopardize your

Prior to authorizing this action, San Diego

NOTE:

By reairtel, San Diego pointed out that Kellison,

who is considered an activist in the New Left movement and

who is affiliated with the Message Information Center (MIC),

has been active in draft counselling. On two occasions

Kellison has been at the MIC during or just prior to the

arrest of two individuals by Bureau Agents for drait violations.

San Diego suggested that SD 1095-R)introduce at MiC meetings

suspicions of Kellison since he was present during or prior

to the arrests.

Such a procedure could neutralize Kellison

informant's relationship with the Center.

to spread suspicion that Lee Raymond Kellison

Informant and through his assistance, two arrests have

been made.

Your airtel does not set out the relationship

thats has with the lessage intormation center

nor hop this

suspicions of Kellison. Your conmunication also does not

indicate whether such & procedure could jeopardize you:

NOTE:

By reairtel, San Diego pointed out that Kellison,

who is considered an activist in the New Left movement and

who is affiliated with the Message Information Center (MIC),

has been active in draft counselling. On two accasions

Kellison has been at the MIC during or just prior to the

arrest of two individuals by Bi

Bureau Agents for draft violations.

San Diego suggested thatC

Wintroduce at MIC meetings

suspicions of Kellison since he was present during or prior

to the arrests. Such a procedure could neutralize Kellison

by casting suspicion on him as an informant.

However,

San Diego's communication does not clearly establish the

Informant's relationship with the Center.

reputation of being a police informant, thereby neutralizing him.

SD states that such

JOEN WATANABE and JON WAGNER, both former members of

established, it is felt that their reported move to the

Los Angeles

area, where their parents reside,

could logically

be the result of

the exposure of their activities in the

San Diego area.

On 2/14/69, information was received that marijuana

and dangerous drugs were being utilized at 4029 Dove Street,

& "crash pad" operated by Message Information Center (MIC) •

This information was furnished to the san Diego POlice Deparfment

in view of the fact that it involved a violation of local law.

The police department subsequently raided the house but were

unable to effect any arrests or locate any drugs on that

particular day. As a result, however, the owner of the house

was confronted

by unknown individuals and apprised of the

activities which were being conducted at the house.

As a result,

the owner reportedly got "fed up", had the house completely

demolished, and sold the property. Thus, the "crash pad" at

4029 Dove Street no longer exists.

LEE RAYMOND KELLISON has reportedly been completely

ostracized by members of MIC and all of the other individuals

throughout the area who are associated with this and/or related

groups.

This seems to be occasioned by the fact that he is

generally considered to be a police informant.

This, of course,

with absolutely no suspicion being cast on the informant. .

D.

MISCELLANEOUS

No substantial amount of public source information

appears to be available concerning MICHAEL F. LUSTIG, San Diego

100-13607. At this time it is not felt that any counterintelligence

action can be taken against LUSTIG without the possibility of

jeopardizing the security of one or more informants.

Therefore,

no counterintelligence action is being requested against LUSTIG

at this time. His activities, however, are being followed

closely and when an opportunity presents itself, appropriate

counterintelligence action will be requested.

hurriedly writing on a small notebook, was observed by Agents

to leave the telephone booth after looking up toward the Seattle

Police Department building.

By way of background, it should

be pointed out that USA STAN PITKIN, who handled the

Government's case in connection with the "Seattle 8" also

received considerable publicity during 1970 in connection

with an expose of police payoffs before a federal Grand Jury

in Seattle, Washington, earlier in 1970.

A source furnished

WEO the call letters and the frequencies which were being utilized

by the marshals appointed by the N™C.

These freatencies were

on the "citizen" band which can be utilized by the public in

general. It became apparent to NFO that some immediate action

was necessary to counteract the very effective use of this equip-

ment by the it in obtaining information about police and military

movements.

WrO realizing the importance to the NMC of obtaining

knowledge concerning police and military contingent novements,

engaged in a "disinfonation" program also utilizing the "citizen'

band. This was done by identifying with the NiC narork as a

unit within that network and by countermanding NMC ordess to the

marshals and by supplying the marshals with misinfornation.

In addition to being able to disrupt the planning of

the MUC, WFO was obtaining information from the NMC about their

Doar 11r. Batten:

I was among the many who attended the Mixon rally

at the Norfolk Arena.

When I approachod the entranco, I was amazed to

, thinic that young poole from "orfolk would abpear in

public dressed as those youngstors were.

I felt that Norfolk

had boon sparea o l the hippie cloment so prevelant on the

campusos of tho large Eastern and Hastern univergities.

I was shocked when I learnod from my son that most

of theso hippies were old Dominion College students.

was evon more upset when I loarnod that an ODC faculty

member, a Professor Heilinger, was one of the demonstrators.

I feol, as many other Virginians do, that such young

people as

thoso I saw demonstrata outside the Arena

should=

not be allowod to onroll at ODo.

I think the Board of Visitors should insist that the=

Administration at CDC bo moro soloct in chang their

prospectivo students.

It appears to me these young neople

are boing oncouraged by faculty members to revolt against

overything that is right and decent.

I donst think the

majority of the domonstrators woro freshmen students and

even if thoy were, I celiovo such an olomont coulá so

virtually oliminatad before they are enrolled by more

soloctivity in choosing prospectiva ODC students.

If thoy wore not froshmon then it appears that ODC

Is allowing a groat number of undesirables to transfer from

ochor collogos.

In my opinion, the board of Visitors should

insist that the ODO Maministrators eithor raise thoir

standards of aûmission or bo more probing in their inquiries

belora aimitting this beatnik elemont to ODC.

ODE President.

I em onclosing a cops of this lottor to Mr. rebo,

It is my hope as a tarpayer and mothor of an ODC

studont that tho hippie eloment, who are probably mombers

of the communist organization; SIS, does not turn ODe

Into anoinor Col umbia Univergity.

Re Bulets dated 5/10/68 and 7/5/68 and Columbia

letter dated 6/26/68.

For the information of the Bureau during the previous

school year, the Columbia Division had two New Lett groups, one

at the University of s.

C. known as AlARE and a chapter of

Southern Students Organizing Committee (SSOC). The AWARE

group was

organized in 1966. During the fall term of 1967,

at the University of S. C. they had their largest membership,

dropping to approximately 6 members by the time the group

disbanded in late April, 1968.

SSOC had a chapter at Furman

University, Greenville,

S. C. during the past school year with

approximately 10 active members; disbanded about May 1, 1968.

During the summer months neither the SSOC or AWARE

group members were active within their organizations or

other New Leit type groups. Information received as of 9/24

and 25/68 indicates that there has been no activity on the

part of the AWARE Group at the University of S. C. or the

SSOC Chapter at Furman University. Sources and informants

state that it does not appear that either group will be active

in the near tuture.

100-149695-66-

The Columbia Division has been developing sources

and informants to place i, the New Left groups and will be

in the position to immediately learn the identities of the

members in the event they subsequently are organized at the

respective schools.

Due to the fact that the groups are now

dormant and there is no activity on the part of the members

who were in the groups the previous school year it is telt

that no counterintelligence action can be taken by the Columbia

Division. In the event they re-organize, the Columbia Division

will be alert for possible situations to disrupt the group

or groups through counterintelligence action.

However, the

Bureau will be advised previous to any direct action being

taken by the Columbia Division.

The leaflet should contain photo-

eifect of forcing the pianis to tale action.

8. Whenever Now Left groups engage in disruptive

activities on college campases, cooperative press contacts

C.BENTO

It was previously reported that the National

Mobilization Committee to ind the War in Vietnam (NMCIWV) is 1/

\ sponsoring massive demonstrations at Chicago, Illinois, during

the forthcoming Democratic National Convention.

One of the problens faced by the Committee is that

of finding housing for the demonstrators who are coming from

outside the Chicago area.

the Committee has now circulated

05,000 forms requestine

the recipients to indicate the number

out-of-town demonstrators they can house.

Our Chicago

Office has obtained a blank copy of the form and desires to

duplicate 250 copies of it. fill them in with fictitious

names and addresses, and return them to the Committee's office.

This action would

cause considerable confusion among the

demonstrators and would hanper the Committee's efforts to

house the demonstrators.

This can be done with no possibility of embarrassment

'to the Bureau and it is felt that Chicago should be authorized

to undertake this counterintelligence action.

Due to the time

element involved, there is enclosed a teletype to the Chicago

Office authorizing this action.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the enclosed teletype be approved.

It was previously reported that the National

Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (NMCEWV) is

Sponsoring massive demonstrations at Chicago, Illinois, during

the forthcoming Democratic National Convention.

One of the problems faced by the Committee is that

of finding housing for the demonstrators who are coming from

outside the Chicago area.

The Committee has now circulated

25,000 forms requesting the recipients to indicate the number

out-of-town demonstrators they can house. Our Chicago

Office has obtained a blank copy of the form and desires

to

duplicate 250 copies

of it, fill them in with fictitious

names and addresses, and return them to the Committee's office.

This action would cause considerable confusion among the

demonstrators and would hamper the Committee's efforts to

lhouse the demonstrators.

This can be done with no possibility of embarrassment

to the Bureau and it is felt that Chicago should be authorized

to undertake this counterintelligence action. Due to the time

element involved, there is

enclosed a teletype to the Chicago

Office authorizing this action.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the enclosed teletype be approved.

Re Boston letter 6/6/69.

I Potential Counterintelligence Action

By letter dated 8/26/69, Boston furnished the Bureal

with plans to furnish GORDON HALL' cooperative free lanc

lecturer and writer on extremist movements, who in the past

has been furnishad with Bureau approval public source data

which he successfully used in several newspaper articles

which graphically exposed radical and subversive local elements,

some material and suggestions regarding the rift that exists

between the Black Panther Party (BPP) and the Students for a

Democratic Society (SDS) in an attenpt to further inflame

already injured feelings on both sides.

This will be furnished

to the Bureau as soon as possible

for their concurrence.

Boston will also remain alert to initiate any counter

intelligence measures in furtherance of this program.

2.

Pending Counterintelligence Action

Boston by letter to the Bureau dated 10/2/69 requested

permission to furnish information to BORERT TONISMSeCUTiY

WHITLOCK, Special Assistant to the President, Harvard College,

by NANCY SCHWARZMAN. SCHWARZMAN has been identified as the

mistress of MICHAEL KAZIN, a Harvard Senior and SDS committee

member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Chapter. KAZIN is further

identified as a friend of MICHAEL ANSARA, Manager of the "Old

Mole," self-described as a radical biweekly newspaper, and

VERNO& GIZZARD, a Key Activist of the Boston Division.

The "Old Molel has published several articles in the

past with information secured from Mr. WHITLOCK's confidential

files.

Boston feels that with Bureau permission this counter-

intelligence measure would dry up a valuable source of information

for SDS and the "Old Mole" as well as provide a valuable service

for a good source of this office.

Tangible Results

Boston with Bureau approval furnished Mr. MALCOM KISPERT,

Vice President aLAcademic Administration, Massachusetts

Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Mass., an established

source of this Office, information to the

effect that VERNON

GRIZZARD, referred to

above, and NICHULAs EGLasoN, a lormer

president of SDS, were employed by MIT as Instructors in the

Department of Humanities. (U. KISPERI because of this

information was able to have GRIZZARD and EGLESON's reappoint-

ments to the staff of MIT canceled. (Ir. KISPERD said that

GRIZZARD was being considered for the post of Instructor in

Humanities for the 1969-1970 academic year and EGLESON'S

reappointment as an instructor would have been automatic.

(KISPERT) was very grateful for this public source data received

and indicated that all aspects of this operation would be kept

confidential.

Boston in cooperation with the Cambridge PD provided

a number of photographs of radicals operating in the Boston

area as a result of a group of 15 youths who forcibly ejected

25 occupants of a Harvard University building. These youths

held the building for fifteen minutes before leaving and

several of the personnel in the building were injured while

being ousted from the premises, two requiring medical attention.

The Cambridge PD does not have an intelligence unit

and did not have any photographs of any of the radical elements

in the Metropolitan Boston area. As a result of the furnishing

of these photographs, one of the participants in the occupation

o1 the harvara building was identified as ERIC MANN, a Key

Burcan concurs with Boston suggestion that the

be an ideal tine to take advantage of

the factionalism

currently so provalent in Students for a Denocratic Society/

Horior Student Alliance (SDS/WSA). Only those sources

who are ran's-ard-file members of

SDS/WSA should participate

in promoting the factionalisu and demonstrate disagreement

with vational headquarters concerning current policies.

New Orleans should submit specific comments concerning

countorintelligence operation in vien of his nosition as a

member of the National Interim Committee (NIC).

All offices submit replies to reach the Bureau no

later than close oi business 10/28/70.

NOTE::

Fureau suggested that Boston should consider exploitation

of dissention in the SDS/WSA under COINTELPRO. SDS/WSA has

called for national denonstrations at San Jose and Detroit on

11./3/70.-: "=:

..:.

There has been unusual dissention, particularly

by chaptors, at Snn Francisco, Chicago, and New Oreans

against

national headquarter's, Boston.

San Francisco and Chicago

advocate far more militant tactics

and are anti-Progressive Labor

Party (PLP) influence. PLP-predominates national headquarters.

Nacional headquartors continuously has avoided a national

convention.

Sone nombers, as well as activity at recent

regional conferences, indicate that national headquarters is

afraid to hold national convention for fear of losing control.

Proposal by Boston, as suggested by the Bureau believed to have

merit under COINTELPIC and will cause considerable disunity and

disruption among leaders and rank-and-file members. Action at

san Jose and Detroit by member infornants should spread throughout

all chapters.

The only "New Left" organizations in the Little Rock

Division are chapters of the Southern Student Organizing

Committee (SSOC) formed in February, 1968, at the University

of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas, and during April, 1968,

by students of Little Rock University (IRU) at Little Rock,

Arkansas.

The University of Arkansas SSOC chapter in reported

to currently have approximately 30 members and the IRU SSOC

chapter has approximately 10 to 12 members.

Neither of these organizations appear to have received

any wide acceptance among the students at their respective

universities and the members, for the most part, are considered

"oddballs" and students who are not in the main stream of the

student activity. In view of this, Little Rock Division does

not recommendany specific counterintelligence action be taken

against either of these _chapters at this time.

on a national basis, it is felt that the most effective

sources in an attempt to ridicule the New Left and their

activist leaders through cartoons and cooperative syndicated

writers who specialize in

easily understood. and accepted by the majority of college

students.

It has been the experience of the Little Rock Office

that most college students do not want to become identified with

these individuals involved in New Left type activities.

Among the faculty members of local

colleges who have been extremely active in espousing left

•wing causes are NOAM CHOMSKY, Professor of Linguistics at

MIT, Cambridge, Mass., and HOWARD ZINN, Professor of Government

at Boston University,

Boston, Mass. In this connection, both

CHOMSKY and ZINN signed a statement supporting Rev. WILLIAM SLOAND

COFFIN, JR., MICHAEL FERBER, MITCHELL GOODMAN,

MARCUS RASKIN and

Dr. BENJAMIN SPOCK.

These individuals on 1/5/60 were indicted

by & Federal Grand Jury at Boston and charged with a continuing

conspiracy to aid, abet and counsel violations of the Selective

Service laws. The indictment alleged a conspiracy calling for

a nationwide program of resistance of the operations of the

Selective Service System, including the counseling, aiding and

abetting of registrants to surrender Classification and

Registration Certificates and interruption of the induction

process at induction centers throughout the country. These

individuals are currently on trial at Boston. ZINN and CHOMSKI

have indicated that they stood beside the above five who have

been indicted for support of draft resistance.

They further

indicated that if they (the five) are sentenced, "we, too, must

be sentenced.

If they are imprisoned, we will take their places

and will continue to use what means we can to bring this war to

an end."

Boston will with Bureau approval attempt to develop

IS

By routing slip, 7/11/68 the Bureau forwarded to

Cleveland copies of the income tax returns of SIDNEY MORRIS

(Security Index - Key Activist) for the years of 1966

and 1967.

An examination of these returns reflects that PECK

• claimed

deductions which, at the very least, provide e basis

for questioning by IRS.

For example, in the year 1967 he

claimed total deductions of $6,565 from a total adjusted income

of $16,689, or over one-third of his adjusted gross income.

Included In these caductions were automobile expenses, other

travel expenses, maintenance of office space in his home even

though he has office space at Case Western Reserve University

and the Cleveland Area Peace/Action Council, and charitable

Included in the latter item

were contributions

to the SPOCK Peace •Fund, HAL's Counseling Service (an anti-

Bureau authority is requested to call PECK's returns

• Ior 1966 and 1967 to the attention of local IRS officials with

the view of suggesting that that Servica may wish to afford

his returns further auditing and examination.

In so doing,

source material concerning PECK's activities in the National

with this recommendation It is contemplated that information

concerning PECK would be called to the attention of (Inspector

SAM GARDNER, of the IRS office in Cleveland. (Inspector

GARDNER has worked closely with the Cleveland Office in

relation to other matters and he has been extremely cooperative,

discreet and reliable during the course of these relationships.

In the event IRS deems It feasible to proceed

with further examination of PECK's returns, the following

benefits could be expected to accrue therefrom:

I. Due to the burden upon the taxpayer of proving

deductions claimed, PECK could be required to produce

documentary evidence supporting his claims. This could'

prove to be both diflicult and embarrassing particularly

with respect to validating the claim for nome maintenance

deductions when, in fact, he doubtless has only the usual

type of study found in many homes rather than actual office

space.

Validations of contributions to SNCC, SDs and the

Hall Counseling Service may also be productive of embarrassing

consequences.

2. II PECK is unable to substantiate his claims

1n the face of detailed serutiny by IRs, 1t could, of course,

• résult in financial loss to him.

3. Most importantly, if IRS contact with PECK

can be arranged within the next

two weeks their demands upon

PECK may be a source of distraction during the critical period

when PECK 1s engaged in meetings and plans for disruption of the

Democratic National Convention. Any drain upon the time and

concentration which PECK, a leading figure in Demon planning,

can bring to bear upon this activity can only accrue to the

benefit of the Government and general public.

The Bureau is requested to consider this suggestion

afford Cleveland the benefit of its comments at the

earliest possible time. No action will be taken by this

office pending receipt of the Bureau's response

to this

With reference to the possibility of the American

emphasis prevalent on many campuses today, it is noted that

Mr. EDWARD KEENAN, Vice-President of the Ohio Bell Telephone

of the principal AT & T Officials in New York City and haa

At the present time, the Cleveland office is considering

ways and means of establishing a fictitious cover organization

to establish contacts with various radical groups in the United

States and ultimately for the extension of such contacts to

foreign organizations. Currently it is not believed that

Cleveland has the type of informant or confidential source

who would be compatible with such an operation.

Recent increments

in manpower

available for security investigations have, however,

for the first time in a substantial period of time created the

possibility for further efforts in the area of informant

development. It is hoped that these additional efforts will be

productive of the type of informant or source who could be

utilized in a cover organization operation as Cleveland regards

chis as a highly valuable source, not only of intelligence

data, but of counterintelligence

activities as well.

pertinent recommendations or suggestions relative to this matter

will be submitted to the Bureau by separate communication.

2) PENDING COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ACTION

By airtel, dated July 24, 1970, under instant caption

Cleveland submitted a recommendation that public source material

concerning the relationship between the student Mobilization

Committee and the SW YSA be furnished on a confidential basis

to the Educational Research Council of America for inclusion

in material which the Council supplies to its clients including

most of the major school systems in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.

3) TANGIBLE RESULTS

In prior correspondence under the above caption, the

Bureau has been advised concerning information furnished

to the

Cleveland District of the Internal Revenue Service concerning

income tax returns submitted by SIDNEY MORRIS PECK (Key Activist).

With the passage of time, and when repeated requests to

Internal Revenue Service Inspector SAM GARDNER for the results

had been thrown out and PECK had been required to pay an

additional tax approximating $500, the exact amount being

unknown to GARDNER.

By letter, dated May 27, 1970, Cleveland pointed out

the results of a counterintelligence measure which resulted

in providing an opportunity for representatives of the

"straight"

college students to present their viewpoint via the public

news media.

Through the cooperation of Mr. FRANK LECJAKS,

Editorial Director of Cleveland IV station WJW (CBS affiliate),

two students at Case-Western Reserve University were given the

opportunity of appearing on a one-half hour TV program which

was aired in Cleveland on June 21, 1970.

On May 21, 1970, (ME TO DARCY NeWS DireCtOIDE)

radio station WELW, Willoughby, ohio, (confidential source-

protect) was provided a copy of the curriculum for an "alternative

educational program"

to be conducted at Cleveland State

University, Cleveland, Ohio during the summer of 1970.

This

program included several courses of dubious academic value

which, judging by the descriptive comments accompanying

the

course listings, appeared highly susceptible to the introduction

• the current wave of student agitation and disruption. Mr.

VOINOVICH subsequently discussed the matter with Dr. JOHN MILLET,

Chairman of the Ohio Board of Regents, and Dr. HAROLD ENARSON,

President of Cleveland State University. During this same

period of time, the Ohio Legislature had under consideration

a bill containing measures designed, to provide state and local

authorities a legal basis for control measures relative to

campus militants who disrupt legitimate educational functions

document made available to Mr. VOINOVICH contributed significantly

toward formulating opinion among Ohio State Legislatures which

ultimately resulted in the passage of an act substantially

CV 100-28895

strengthening the position of university administrators and

local law enforcement officials with respect to campus

disruption and violence.

Since the act was passed after the

wave of disruption in early May, 1970, and in view of the

fact that it contained a 90 day

waiting period to become

effective, its efficacy as a means of controlling campus

militancy will not be determined until after the beginning

of the 1970-1971 school year. If properly utilized, however,

the legislation should be very beneficial.
