that Oswald visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico -- no.

Did he know anyone

in the Cuban Embassy that knew Oswald or knew anything about him no.

→it this time Silvia Duren was in the hands of the Mexican police but (I-9

was obviously unaware of her detention).

Asked what the reaction of those

inside the Embassy was to the news of the President's death, I-9 said that

he had heard very little talk about it, that the Saturday morning staff

meting was a short, perfunctory affair, but that just about everyone seemed

to be truly shocked.

He had heard no one expressing pleasure about the

He said that this reinforced his belief that once Fidel Castro

the Cuban people, even many of those who are now classified as

Patria o Muerte types, will quickly show themselves to be essentially good

people and essentially US oriented.

thing - that he should not go out making mysterious meetings with people in

first topic for discussion.

He said that Silvia was back in the Embassy

the 25th and said that she had been held for 6 hours by the Federal

She seemed to be quite pleased with her performance - said she kept

reminding the police that Mexico is a foe country and that the constitution

quaranteed her freedom from such persecution.

To this the police just laughed

and said that the constitution wouldn't do her much good in jail,

better cooperate if she wanted to get out.

She freely admitted that she had

seen Asiald in the Consulate, that he came Jooking for a visa but that Cuba

had answered the request (this seems like fast conno) to the effect that

intil he received a USSR visa. She said that the cops had threatened her

with extradition to the US (seems unlikely) whereupon she said she would be

lad to no to the US to face Oswald. She said that complaints would be mad

RUIREZ is or what his access to IM is) Silvia said that she was quite sur-

priced that word of her arrest was relayed to Raul. APARICIO Nogales so fast

by (Mu) TREJO who flashed the word by 2300 hours 23 Nov.

At this point

Teresa PROENZA, one of the crowd listening to Silvia tell her tale,

her nephew to leave - said,

"we don't want you around here." All in all,

silvia thought she did a good job of standing up to the police. L- repeated,

as he has done before,

that she is a very intelligent, quick-witted girl.

She did not appear to have been roughed up in any way

or to have suffered from

her "ordeal."

5. LI-? had nothing more to offer on the Kennedy assassination • was

again shown a photo of Oswald - never saw the man.

He said that there is

not much talk around the Embassy about the killing - perhaps because no

one is expected to approve of such a thing yet at the same time no one wants

to make too much fuss about it for fear of being suspected as pro-American.

6. (I-9 reported on other matters as follows:

a. The Counselor of the Soviet Embassy (no name given) came to

the Cuban Embassy at about 1045 Monday 25 November.

Ing. JorgetTAMATO was in the Embassy on Monday 25 November.

He remarked that he had been to see ITA? Ordas some time ago

about getting a permit to send his son to Cuba to see the heart

specialist Dr. Enrique CABRRA. (I's son suffers from some heart

ailment). DIAZ Ordaz questioned I closely about the projected

trip (this was while DO vas Minister of Government) and I took

advantage of the occasion to complain to DO that people from the

procuraduria had confiscated some medical slides from a Cuban

heart specialist at the airport. (I-I was the person who eventually

recovered these slides. according

to I, DO was somewhat upset,

said that the procuraduria people had no

business doing this,

and saw to it that the slides vere retuned. IT said that DO

mentioned In? by name, telling I that he would see to it that

an order was issued for the slides to be turned over to I-9.

I passed word around the Cuban Embassy that everyone should be

very careful to speak only the best of DO who might prove to

be a useful friend.

A meeting a Consular officers fron all Cuban Consulates was held

on Tuesday. I-9) does not know what went on at this meeting.
