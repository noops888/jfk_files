No information could be found identifiable with above. C-77202

on Perry HARTEN reflects that Perry and wife, Rose Madeline HARTEN,

were registered agents for the Brussels World Exposition in 1956.

Perry HARTEN in 1955 was being considered for assignment in QK-

ACTIVE, but no use materialized. He was born 25 October 1915 in

New York City and had been employed from 1942-1945 with OWI, and in

1946 transferred to the Department of State as Chief of Studio Operating

Section (IBD). He also worked for USIA until 1954 and his termination

may have been based on an investigation then being conducted by State

Department on a suspected homosexual ring in VOA since Subject was

at that time under suspicion based on reports from co-workers.
