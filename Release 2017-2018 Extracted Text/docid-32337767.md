2. Since the writing of our memorandum of 14 June 1961, (cf. ;

insteal,a

para l:a. above), the following supplementary information has been

or mer

developed concerning Nicolas reorges

Metico

who is a contact and client of Justo SIERRA

mentioned in the Seva

a. Nicolas Georges DAMASCUS reportedly is officially

born

10 March.

1931 at Alexandria, the son of George

DAMASCOU and

Angelika

57 Heliopolis Street in Alexandria. Representatives of this Agency in

Alexandria advise that local available records indicate that as of May

1959, Nicolas DAMASCOU resided at 6 Birtley Place, Elizabeth' Bay,

Sydney, Australia, and that he listed his occupation as that of "Clerk."

Our field records indicate that as of May 1959, the United States Con-.

Sulate in Sydney had some interest in him, and it is suggested that the

indices of the Department of State may contain further information con-

cerning this individual.

b. Anastasie (or Anastasia) Georg

DAMAS CUS aka

DAMASCOU, Sistet of Nicolas DAMASCUS: above, was born March 1933.

place of birth not indicated but presumably Egypt, was identified by our

representatives in Alexandria as having filed application for a United U.J,9

States Visa at London, England in July 1956, listing her occupation as

SELE

that of "entertainer." It is suggested that the Visa Files of the Depart-Metree

ment of State may contain additional information on this individual.

c. Further inquiries in Mexico by our officials there revealed

that Nicolas DAMASCUS had been ordered to leave Mexico in October

1960 solely because of the expiration of his tourist card, which had been

once extended. Mexican Records fail to show that he returned to Mexico,

following his entry into the United States at Brownsville, Texas, from

Matamoros, Tamaulipas on 24 October 1960g

Upon arrival in Mexico on

22 June 1960, he indicated that the purpose of his visit was to attend the

wedding of his sister,

Anastasie, identified in preceding paragraph,

however, as of 21 June 1961, there was no record of Anastasie

DAMASCUS aka DAMASCOU in official Mexican Files, and there was

as yet no identification of the individual she was alleged to have been

scheduled to marry. From the same source it was learned that for the

period 22 June through 6 September 1960, the only address listed in.

official indices for Nicolas DAMASCUS is c/o Justo SIERRA, Reforma

95-407, Mexico City, which is the law office maintained by Justo SIERRA(S)

Casasus, former Counselor of the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D. C. (S

and who is further identified in the documents cited in paragraph 1. c.

through h. above. DAMASCUS reportedly used SIERRA to attempt to (5)

obtain an extension of his tourist permit, although the details of his con-

tacts with and knowledge of SIERRA himself are not known at this timeS

Veither has it been possible as of this date to verify the reported con-

tact between Nicolas DAMASCUS and Subjects at the Hotel New Yorker,

as reported by Mr. Thomas DONLON. Investigation efforts abroad by

this Agency are continuing, however, and any further information

developed will be forwarded as soon as available.

3. In light of the escape route used by the two NSA defectors,

transitting Mexico and presumably Cuba enroute to the USSR, your

particular attention is invited to the information concerning the contacts

and views of Justo SIERRA Casasus furnished in the reports cited in(3Rasvia

paragraph 1. e., f.

and g. above.

It is noted Justo SIERRA Casasus 1S

is identical with the Senor Don Justo SIERRA, First Secretary at the

embassy of Mexico, mentioned in Bureau Reports-cited in paragraph h.(S

above as a contact of Boris A

KAZANTSEV, First Secretary of the

Soviet Embassy in Washington from 1952-54. It is further noted that

Boris KAZANTSEY, alter returning to Moscow in 1954 and assuming Authfis

"the post of First Secretary in the Latin American Division of the USSR

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was next assigned from 1955 to 1957 as

R.G. B

First Secretary and subsequently Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City, and that as of 1960 he was assigned to the Soviet Embassy

in Havana, Cuba, in the position of Counselor, departing Havana for ,

Mexico, in company of his wife and daughter, on 30 June 1961, and

then proceeding to Canada on 2 July 1961.

Soviet State Security (KGB). It is requested that any further information

which may be reflected in the indices of your Bureau, or those of infor-

mation addressee, reflecting uponthe relationship of Nicolas Georges

DAMASCUS aka DAMASCOU and his sister Anastasia Georges DAMASCUS

with representatives of agents of the CASTRO government in Cuba, or

on SIERRA's continued contacts with KAZANIStV or other suspect S
