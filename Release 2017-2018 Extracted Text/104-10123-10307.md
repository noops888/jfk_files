refers to the subject of Comnications Intelligence®

I am aware that there

are special regulations of the Central Intelligence Agency entitled "Communi-

my duties. I appreciate that the preservation of Communications Intelligence

source is of the utmost importance to the United States and that the loss of

such sources would be irreparable.

material of the particular category involved. By regulation I am aware that

the responsibility of ascertaining that such an authorization for another

person is valid and current, and that it is of appropriate scope, rests with
