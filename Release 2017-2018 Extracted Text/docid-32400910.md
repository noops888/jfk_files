%. (Internal Use Only - LLM) LIAISON Met with Senator H. John

Heinz (R., Pa.) and his aide, Mark Bisnow, and reviewed with them the

information we had retrieved on the ownership of Air Taxi Company.

Senator Heinz had two additional questions and he had no problem with

having these questions go through Ken McLean, Staff Director, Senate

Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. The questions related

to whether we had made an inquiry of former COS' who served in Tehran

in early 1970 and whether we had any information on a showing in Iran

of a Bell Helicopter film which was attended by the Shah of Iran and

General Khatami. The tenor of the questions from Bisnow and the Senator

seemed to suggest that they felt we should have been more active in

investigating all aspects in Iran which may be of interest to the Banking

Committee, but I said that we had no way of knowing what that would be,

and the only way we could provide was on the basis of specific questions,

and the Senator agreed.

8. (Internal Use Only - LLM) LIAISON Saw Mike Epstein, Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence staff, to determine what role the Committee

felt would be their responsibility to play in determining releasing and

controlling access to testimony and material developed by the Church

Committee which the staff of the House Select Committee on Assassinations

is interested in reviewing.

9. (Unclassified - MLG) LIAISON Per Robert Kelso's request I

forwarded to Dorothy Fosdick, of the Senate Governmental Affairs

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations staff, one copy of a recent

speech given by Chinese diplomat Liao Cheng Chih.

10. (Unclassified - RJK.) LIAISON Talked to a member of

Representative Charles Bennett's (D., Fla.) staff in response to their

reminder that they had not received a response to the Congressman's

inquiry on behalf of their constituent, Marcus Conant. I advised her

that a response had been sent out from our office on Monday, 30 January 1978,

and apparently our two letters crossed in the mail.
