GABRIEL MANARIO, aka.

AR

On 5/29/61, PCI

New Kensington, Pa.,

advised

SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III:

The MANNARINO controlled horse-room on the second floor at

1195-5th Avenue, New Kensington, receives results from

Weirton, W. Va.

They have a direct wire to a store in that

town which is ostensibly a television repair shop but is

actually a race result relay station.

The direct wire has

an Edison (New Kensington) exchange

and 1s very expensive.

Although it is generally known that this horse-room 1s a

MANNARINO operation, it is difficult to say who fronts it for

them, because personnel changes are fairly frequent. An

attempt will be made to learn the Edison telephone number

used in Weirton and the identity of the individual to whom

it is billed, believed to

be ANdy MANGINI, who holas a,

Federal Wagering Tax Stamp.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS
