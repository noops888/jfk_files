Early in April 1968 the Cifice of the General Coun

sel made available to Central Cover Staff (CCS) & COpy of a

letter and an attached liat of organizations sent to tbe

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by Hr. Jon Frappier of Ram

Darts Magazine•

The letter, dated 5 April 1968, had been

furnished OGC

through INs liaison channels.

The letter appended

a list of 145 tax exempt organizations and

indicated tbat all

were suspected of having bees funded by or having cooperated

with CIA.

3.

The letter indicated that the listed organizations

were only a part of the organizations being scrutinized by

Ramparts and that other available sources of Information on

these and other suspect organizations had already been examined.

The other sources of infomation vere stated as including the

Ilterature of the organizations and interviews with their staff

members; records avallable in the Attorney General's offices

atta in the Attorney

Massachusetts, and New York; data avallable at

the Rational Lagorcation Bureau In New York, Group Research,

Inc., In Washington, D.C., and the Foundation Library Centers

In New York and Washington; and the 990-A returns available at

the district offices of the IRS. The letter requested 990A

Ramparts asked the IRS

to make these naterials available for inspection at a mutu

ally convenient time.

1. A revier of available CIA dnta on the listed organi

zations has shown that 89 of then were at one time or another

sonehow associated with CIA. Cniy two of these:

are of current operational interest. These two activities

and 45 organizations fornerly of Interest to CIA were men-

toned in the American press during MHDOWEL 0 Fortytro

otber listed organizations which rere in fact associated

I with CIA vere not exposed during (HHDOYEL.Ul we have found no

evidence that 55 organizations onthe l13t vero ever directly

or indirectly associated with CIA.

(Because two of the names

on the list are successive names for the sane organization,

the actual total number of organizations listed is 144 rather

than 145.)

Three addittonal project organizations, not

Inciuded in the Raparts list, may be vulnerable because

they

wore covertly funded by hitherto unexposed foundation

funding instruments included in the list. Only one of these,

rent operational interest.

5. The CA Stalf was furnished a copy of the Ramparts

lotter and list and has checked out the organizations of

possible previous CA Stail interest. All organizations not

readily identillable with known project organizations or as

CCS funding instrunents have been traced with RID, with CS

nrea divisiona that night logically have had an interest in

them and agalust CCS Registry Illcs. Through arrangements

wIth the IRS, representatives of CCS and OGC also examined

available IRS data (990-A'5 and Forms 1023) on the listed

organizations. Thia tas done before the IRS documents vere

made avallable to Ramparts, in order to be sure that restilete

$90-A, Part I data would not be furnished to Ramparts and to

try to establish the reasons for Romparts' Interest In the

organizations.

Our current Lindings are the results of these

various file rovlews.

Attached hereto are annexes listlog and discussing

the several categories of organizations on the Ramparts list.

Annex A deals with the two organizations on the list which

are still of active operational interest. Both received

The 42 former project organizations listed and des

Sixteen organizations fall into this category. Eleven

for exclusive use in funding one project each and one

was used for a one tine travel grant

b. M1tting logitimate foundationg and organiza

sis organizations were

used in this way and provided cover for seven agents

however, that any undetected operational interest in the

organizations was in the period of the early 1950's and of a

marginal nature.

9. In reviewing avallable information on the listed

organizations ve attempted to deternine whether there was &

logical external basis for Ramparts' interest in the organi-

zations or whether some form of internal Agency leak might

be involved. Our reviews and analysis show falrly conclu

sively that Ramparts has been proceeding on the basis of

overtly available information, supplemented by interviews

with project personnel:

#. All but three of the 42 terminated but hither

to unexposed project organizations and 24 of the 55 or

gantrations which actually had no Agency ties are some

how related to project organizations or funding instru

ments previously exposed. Some of the organizations

made legitimate or covert grants to previously exposed

organizations, others received covert or legitimate

grants frow previously exposed funding instruments or

from innocent foundations that had made legitimate

grants to exposed organi ations, and still othere had

officers who were associated with exposed CIA organt

zations.

Thirty-one innocent organizations on the

Ramparty list and three of the hitherto unexposed

organizations of former interest to the Agency have

no such known ties to exposed Agency organizations.

In most of these cases, however, the names of the

organizations are similar to those of exposed organ

izations or are of a nature that makes them suspect.
