ordered into four year exile outside his native Sicily by the

Caltanissetta court today (March 21) for contacts with»suspected

in touch with Angelo Bruno, 53, who was arrested in Washington

last Dec. 13 when

he stepped from a plane in which he had flown

back to the United States from Italy.

"The FBI said Bruno was wanted as the reputed Phila-

delphia boss

of Cosa Nostra, the American crime organization

SECKED

"The Caltanissetta court

gave police an order to send

Sinatra on a one-way train ride to San Lucio, a tiny town near

500 miles from his native Sicilian village of Vallelunga.

"Sinatra

is the third Sicilian to be ordered into 'exile

on the continent' in the past few weeks by Sicilian courts

cracking down on the Mafia.

"The Caltanissetta regional court of appeals today began

consideration of an appeal of one of the other two, Genco Russo,

against his five-year exle in the little north Italian town of

Lovere."

Dr. Aristide Manopulo of the Central Bureau, Criminal

Division, Italian National Police, advised on 3/27/64

that the in-

formation

provided by the Bureau concerning the visit of Sinatra

to the United States in June, 1962, was an important factor in

having Sinatra exiled from Sicily. (> (U)
