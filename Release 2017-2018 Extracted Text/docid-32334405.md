Closely assoclated "ith the organization and perhaps

a member is Richard W. Dawson,

who lives on Highway 121 on

the outskirts of Fort Worth and who has formerly lived in the

neighborhood of 2820 Northwest 29th in the early 1950'g. Dallas

I advised that an attorney whom members of the group

have

been advised to contact if "they get into trouble"

• 1s W. Alfred

Windor, with offices In the Ellis Building In Fort

Worth.

DaLlas

Tol advised he

does not know wrother or not. windor

is a member of the organization.

Dallas T-I advised the primary purpose of the

organization is to light against the present Federal control

of national and local Governments and to fight for "States!

rights".

The group is supposedly national in origin and

believes that the Federal Government is in the process of

selling out to the communists and that the group is the last

Iine of defense gainst this

sellout. The group secondarily

is racial in that it believes in white

supremacy. Dallas I-l

advised that the organization suffered a severe setback

because of the assassination of President Kennedy but now

is

attempting a full-scale reorganization.

The group recruits

basically from those who do not have criminal

records and is

organized in such a manner that no one is supposed to know

the

names of other members in the organization. This is to

prevent effective infiltration by the Governent. Dallas T-1

advised that the group

has no inmediate plans

for action,

but that several times locally this group has determined

to

act on their own and this action, has been curtailed because

of orders relayed from higher authority in the organization

These higher authorities are unknow, to Dallas T-l, except

that a person by the name of Ray (last nane unknown) at the

ranch in the vicinity of Venus,

Texas,

appears to be in contact

with the group's organizational leaders..

Ray is described

a personal and close friend of retired General Edwin

Walker

and about one and one-half to two years ago was

apparently

implicated in some manner in the burning of a newspaper in the

area of Midlothian,.

Texas.

Ray is also apparently a rarehouse

supervisor in Dallas.

Dallas I-I also advised he has

been recently con

tacted by a man whom be does not know but who

apparently lives

in the Fort Worth area, and

this

unknown male

advised Dallas

T= I

to disassociate himself

attached to for the apparent purpose of moving into a position

of more prominence in the organization.

Dallas I-l advised

that

the small group with which he has been associated is the

lowest level in the organization and that their primary

purpose is to do the "dirty work".

Dallas I-l stated that the group is also prepared,

in the event of a Negro uprising in the Fort Worth area,

take action against various Negro leaders tacluding Di. Flint,

DI.

Fleming and Dr. Ransom, and a Fort Worth hoodlum named

Madison Hogan, who is apparently a Nation of Islam leader

in the Fort Worth area.

Dallas I-l advised that the only overt action tenta-

tively planned for the winter months is that the effect of

a .30 caliber rifle on power transformers in the area may be

tested. Dallas

Tol further stated that the group apparently

has a contact with an individual in northeast Texas who goes

by the name of "South" and that this contact may be utilized

in the raiding of a northeast Texas armory during the winter

months.

The primary interest is obtaining mortars and mortar.

ammunition and automatic weapons; therefore, Dallas T-1

believes that the armory would probably be of a tank or

infantry group.

Dallas I'l advised that the group locally is

attempting to gain control of the Panther City Motorcycle

Club for the purpose of gaining land apparently owned by this

club, in the

area of Lake Arlington, Texas, and thereafter

selling this land and using the monies therefrom for purchases

of the group.

Dallas I-l advised that it has been learned the group

has

organizations in Stephenville, San Angelo, Italy and

Brownwood, Texas.

Dallas I-l further advised that Arthur,

Pollard has in the past made trips to Alabama, Wyoming,

Montana, California, and that the group has a

contact with

an individual by the name of Jim Scott in Kansas City. Dallas

T=l advised that be has seen pamphlets from national Minutemen

headquarters, but that these dealt primarily with the fighting

of any National Firearms Act

which would involve licensing of

private weapons.

"Ray", who appears to be the highest group official

in the area,

is speaking more of retired General Edwin Walker's

guidance and leadership of the organination. He speaks in

near reverent terme concerning Walker. Dallas Tol advised

that "Ray" was arranging a meeting with General

Walker for

him, but after further consideration, decided it would not

be appropriate at this time, because

Walker becomes suspicious

of those who too quickly attempt to meet him.

"Ray" advised

that it would be wiser to wait until the General requests

to see him or until he had been in the organization a longer

Dallas I-l further stated that William Seals of

Houston, Texas, formerly of Fort Worth,

has not been recently

in contact with the group in Fort Worth.

Dallas I-l advised he had no information that the

group had yet established a local storehouse or arsenal for

weapons and that the membership and leaders in the local

group have remained unchanged.
