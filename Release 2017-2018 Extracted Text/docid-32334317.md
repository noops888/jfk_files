On January 24, 1965, the following conversation

was

overheard between ARVIS WARNER and PAUL COONE, both members of

the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (OKKKK) as well as

the Minutemen in Bogalusa.

WARNER stated that "JELLY" POUNDS is self-employed

as a painter and his real name is RANDLE C. POUNDS, telephone

RE 2-4975.

WARNER also remarked that after the Minutemen meeting

on January 26, 1965, the members would go to the area of the

residence of LOU MAJORS and ostensibly have a flat tire and

then proceed to make a loud noise changing this tire in order

to aggravate MAJORS. WARNER stated that an individual by

the name of ROBERT RICHMOND, an attorney, resides next door

to MAJORS and RICHMOND had been forewarned of this so that he

and his family would not be concerned.

WARNER also related that he had been advised by

an unknown waitress at Graham's Cafe that the owner of the

cafe had been informed by Mayor JESSE CUTRER and ANDY OVERTON,

the Commissioner of Finance, that during this week Negroes

would be testing his establishment to see whether they would

be served. WARNER stated that CUTRER and also ARNOLD SPIERS,

the Commissioner of Safety, had told the proprietor of the

WARNER was overheard to tell COONE that he

wanted COONE to obtain a can of spray paint and a can of

spray glue which could be placed in the lock and door

to the office of LoU MaJoRs,

BASCOM TALLEY and RALPH

BLUMBERG, in order to make these doors and locks inoperable.

COONE was overheard to ask WARNER if his Minutemen

unit in Bogalusa was in any way associated with the national

organization of the same name and also asked WARNER for any

literature on the Minutemen so that he, COONE, could give

it to the members of his unit. WARNER stated that the

Minutemen in Bogalusa are associated with the national

organization of the same name but did not have any literature

to give to COONE as this was

another way in which the FBI

could check on the members.

WARNER added that a second Minutemen unit has

been started in Bogalusa by ALBERT APPLEWHITE and this

unit has 10 members, not further identified, and their

first project was placing a dead animal on the back porch

of RALPH BLUMBERG's residence who is also the owner of

radio station WBOX, Bogalusa.

WARNER stated that in the past Klan leaders have

had to use a great deal of persuasion on "JELLY" POUNDS,
