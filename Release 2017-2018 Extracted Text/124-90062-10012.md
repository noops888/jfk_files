1956, after which he entered military service. He was released after six

monthe as a Second Ileutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps. In

his work in Dermark, for a firn doing military construction in Greenland,

ALLEY does not have access to olassified documents, but he does have aocess

to unclassified blueprints and other papers and he is in contact with a

number of people worlding on the Greenland projects.

Lo It appears that ALLEY was the individual through whom ABARCHALIN

cane into contact with Marvin KANTOR, Inasmich as ALLEY indicated to ABAR-

CHALIN on 5 November 1959 that he would introduce him to KANTOR that evening.

It is belleved that on that evening ALLEY and ABARCHALIN walked together to

KANTOR 's address but failed to see him. According to official travel records,

KANTOR had loft Denmark for the USSR on 25 May 1959. He returned on 10 Septem-

ber 1959, presumably having spent the intervening period in the Soviet Union.

5. On the evening of 16 November 1959, however, ABARCHALIN was observed

entering a local restaurant with ALLEY and KANTOR. The three sat down at a

table with two unidentified foreigners of oriental appearance. All members of

the group apparently knew each other, sinoe they immediately entered into

rather animated conversation. They also looked at some papers or magasines,

one of which bore the title, soviet film. Later in the evening KANTOR loft

the restaurant alone, carrying a newspaper or magazine, and ALLEY and ABAR-

CHALIN left together soon thereafter, ALlEY separating fron ABARCHALIN arter

a shori time and returning to his residence alone.

The two oriental-looking

foreigners remained in the restaurant and later joined two other men who also

appeared to be foreigners. One of the latter two left the restaurant at about

0050 hours and drove off in a car registered to Willian VALENGIA, an education

student born on 9 Maroh 1936 in Chicago.

The other unidentifled foreigner was

a Negro who left the restaurant at 0015 hours.

We will forward to you any additional information that may be received

concerning the mattors reported above.
