I niso bulieve that his recent stasemerts to re

I an suro that the Subjeet is recruitable.

The

question is what deurce of associabion with the Agency

would be appropriate.

If the decision is made to approach

the Subject,

may I suggest that hid association be initially

limited to Agency briefings and debriefings betore and after

his rins to Latin Aerica.

and

the accuracy of tis reporting is proven then further
