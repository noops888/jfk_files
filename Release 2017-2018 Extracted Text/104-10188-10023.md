HM.1-39,679, 28 October 1970

I. Primary responsibility for the operational and

administrative handling of the LIENPTY Project was

transferred,

effective 1 December 1970, within the Station from the REDTOP

to the Operational Support Section,

This transfer was made

as part of our effort to consolidate basic support functions

1n

the Operational Support Section, and to relieve the REDTOP

Section of actlvities. which do not

contribute directly to tho

pursuit of priority recruitment targets.

Section

However, the REDTOP

will continue to be

the principal consumer of the

LIEMPTY product

as reccived from the LILYRIC and LICALLA

photo

survelllance points.

It will also be the maio provid-

or of guidance and requests for apecial LILYRIC/LICALLA

coverage.

The provious REDTOP Case Officer (Bruce H. FERNALD)

introduced the new Case Officer, Howard T. BAGUS,

to LILUPTY

∞13, and -14 In early December.

LIbOUSINE, owner of the

LILYRIC property, will continue

8s LiCillit is concerned,

its location and status was never open

to question, and Its Incation in the LIniSt complex is fogularly

mentioned in LIMESA progress renewal requests.

The Station under-

stands that a meno describing the locations of the various base

houses was attached to tlie most recent LIkESA project renewal

request when it was submitted to the staiis by wi/l.

Personuel within the base houses is also well-documented

(most of the LIFTY progress reports have identified each agent

in each house);: and the parsonnel have never been switched from

house to house.

Perhaps the best rundorn of these persönnel is

Raymond H. GREND's security review, Pornarded with IMMA- 31164,

21 January 1967.

3.

Station Real Property reports are also, with one

exception (NEXI-41), up-to-date and they reflect current cond

tions.

MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALL.

Nevettheless,

the Station asked for

$1800 lor

rent and utilities for

following reasons:

first of all,

expense no mattér

Secondly, the rent,

though returned to the Station because NOl'IRN owns'the

occupant of LIcALLA.

He,

in

turn,

is reinbursed by

the station via GERENDE. "LIMOUSINE

eventually returns the money, at which tire it is credited to

expense.

This could, of course, be handled differently, but the

Station

has always found it conventent to tinance in this manner,

largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are haudled on a'

annuad basis.

The reimbursement, therefore, often comes many

months after the payment.

4.

The Station neglected to cancel uzXl-11, which, should

be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the

nove in 1966.

LILYRIC IS nOW MEXI-132, and is in the building

oTed by LIlOUSINE.

Rent payments are

as originally Intended;

being used to help liquidate LIMOUSINE's debt, and, as instructed

in HMS-4814, 15 June J966, the Station is crediting this money

to miscellaneous receipts.

These can be, therefore, no question

of the need to include money for LILYRIC

the LIEMPTY project.

LILYRIC rent 18, and has been since the

apartment was occupied in October 1966,

3,000 pesos per, month,

which amounts to $7, 880 per yeax ($3,200 has been requested in

order to include utilities).

Headguarters is correct in stating

that the agreed-upon figure for the rent in this new building

was 2,300 pesos fer month.

Station files irdicate that the

resson for the increase (and this apparently was not roported

• to Headquarters) was that the bank which holds the major part

of LIMOUSIN's loan had determined that 3,000 pesos was a fair

price for the apartment.

The Station had, of course, no choice

but to go along with this.

Station has no record of MEXI-02, but it is likely

that

But since that

LIMITED apartment ceased to exist.

The presence of so many new desk personnel at

•people who are unfamiliar with station

hiatory - means

that we must turn to you with questions

oftener than you might wish.

Our present question

concerns property involved in LIMPrY.

(We are submitting

the project as received from the fleld, but do not

understand the background very well.)

H1MA-11257 of 16 January 1959,

tbat

& project renewal, said

"approximately one year ago the LICALLA base

purchased by KUBARK through: LIMOUSINE", and we have not found

any cables or dispatches which would show a change in that

status.

Does NEXI 03 LIMUST/LIMESA (see Real Property Beport

of August 1967) Include LICALLA? If 80, und if we own

LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and

utilities?

(Up until the subaission dated 1963 the project

renewal used to say

*LIMITED and LICALLA rents are returned.

to station by LIMOUSINS and credited to station miscellaneous

receipts" but after that time this sentence vas elininated.)
