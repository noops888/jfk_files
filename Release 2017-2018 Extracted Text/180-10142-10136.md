Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917. Ms. Garro attended

the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later

did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the

University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married

to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest, poets and leading intellectuals. When

Octavia was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also

named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early

life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity

about her native land and had a reputation for being one

if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena

was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of

Mexican life and made an important contribution to its

artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El' Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

Elena Garro, there is no frontier between reality and

people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important

connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been

friendly with Embassy officers. Her broad range of signifi-

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target. Through-

He was apparently quite smitten with the

daughter and tried to call her on several occasions after

the party.

The daughter did not take the calls and as

To further investigate Ms. Garro's story,the Federal

Bureau interviewed Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius on

November 27, 1964. (IBID&" Lavagnini recalled that there

were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran party,

few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexican girl

who had recently returned from living in France. He was

unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it was

probably early in September because of a heavy rain which

occurred as they were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m.

(IBID. p. 4)

Lavagnini noted no Americans present at this party.

He was familiar with the appearance of Lee Harvey Oswald

because of publicity following the assassination of President

Kennedy but otherwise had no knowledge of him and had never

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer

conversation with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587,

under the pretext that they were in danger. Elena

claimed to have told Calvillo that she wanted to tell

her story to the American Embassy. Calvillo dissuaded

her by telling her that the American Embassy was full

of Communist spies. Elena said that some of the other

people who had been at the party were taken to Veracruz

where they were "protected" by Governor Lopez Arias.

She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly "protected" by

General Clark Flores, was very prosperous and was driving

a big car.

to anything she and Elenita said" (Ibid.)

She stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's

home. She was unclear about the date of the party. It

was a few days before the Soviet Astronaut, Gagarin,

visited Mexico; she thought that this would put the party

around September 2 or 3, 1963. She believed that the party

was on a Monday or Tuesday because it was an odd night for

a party.

The memo noted that September 1 and 2 were

indeed a Monday and Tuesday. Elena could not check her

calender to refresh her memory at the time of the interview

because the calender was in a desk that had been stored

away -

During the conversation, Elena described Oswald

and his companions. The man who she thought was Oswald

wore a black sweater. She said he was quiet "and stared a

lot at the floor." One of his companions "was very tall

and slender and had long blond hair which hung across his

forehead. He had a

gaunt face and a rather long protruding

chin." The other companion was also tall, with short,

light brown hair and no really distinguishing characteristics.

The three Americans did not dance or mix with the other

guests.

Elena saw the same three men on the street the

next day. (IBID.)

Ambassador regarding the Garros allegations. (Memo from

No further reports on Elena's story were generated

until 1969 when Charles Thomas was "selected out."

("Selected out" is a phrase used when an officer is retired

after having been in one

higher grade). Then, he wrote a letter and memorandum

letter, Mr. Thomas also writes, "whereas the FBI has

discounted Elena Garro's allegations, the CIA is still

considerably disturbed by them." (IBID.) The Legat's

office in response wrote that/Alan White from the CIA had

indicated that he was aware of Elena's unreliability.

(FBI report, 9/30/69, p. 7, JFK Document No.

The Legat's office further wrote that the concept that

every person who passes on to another government agency

information relating to matters within the jurisdiction

of that agency has the responsibility and authority

to review and evaluate the action taken by that agency

is, of course, untenable. (IBID.)
