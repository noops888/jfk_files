passed to the FBI at any given time, she certainly would have laown

about it; that"

vised the case and would have come to her for the pictares.

She

"the FBI legal attache who headed the FBI investigation in Mexico.

stated that the interrogator probably collected the pictures frore

a linug book" (look-out notices maintained in the embassy) which

wa's available to the FBI. This book consisted of American soldiers

AWOL, American travelers to and from communist countries, pez-

sons wanted for criminal violations, etc. The photos came from a

variety of sources including FBI headquarters, CIA, U. S. military

services, and the Mexican police:

2 We also queried the Mexican station regarding the 20

photographs with negative results. The entire station mele

Son Lee Harvey Oswald was forwarded intact to Headquarter

on 25 February 1970. These also were examined without success.
