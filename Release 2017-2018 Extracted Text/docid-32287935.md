NO 92-50

JOHNSON was unknown to him and since the New Orleans office

will enforce local and

this regard, it is noted that Sheriff EDWARD MC DONNELL

nas continued to allow RICHARD KNOX HEAD, aka "Dick" Head,

New Orleans top hoodlum in New Orleans file 92-51, Bufile 92-2795,

to operate the Sa-When Lounge on West Beach, Biloxi, Miss.,

despite assertions before taking office that HEAD would be

among "the first to go" when MC DONNELL took office 1/6/64.

NO 1225-C, Gulfport, Miss., an informant of

known reliability who continues to furnish information

concerning criminal activities on the Mississippi Gulf

Coast, furnished information 2/7/64 indicating that

HEAD very probably cooperated with known hoodlums, DONALD

LESTER JAMES, aka Jimmy James, and DELBERT O'NEAL, aka

"Little Governor" in plans for "steering a mark" to JAMES

and O'NEAL at the Broadwater Beach Hotel, Biloxi, Miss.,

over the weekend 2/8-9/64 for a rigged crap game... The

possibility exists, therefore, that dissemination to Sheriff

MC DONNELL on matters concerning HEAD and his associates

might conceivable result in compromising sources. Similarly,

NO 1225-C advised on 2/10/64 that PENNIS BROADUS

a member

of the Harrison County, Miss., Board of Supervisors, and

IVAN ORRELS, known Gulfport, Miss., hoodlum, telephoned

on the night of 2/8/64 in

the Mississippi State Penitentiary of AL COUNSSON,

According to informant,

BROADUS there was "too much heat" on the penitentiary at ss

the present time, due to the fact that former Governor

ROSS R. BARNETT had made an excessive number of pardons

JOHNSON reportedly told BROADUS to contact

Informant was

aware of the consideration JOHNSON expected in return.

The foregoing is furnished for the information
