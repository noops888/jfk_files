11. Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means

(Explain in detail) :

TP 41-PCI, whose identity is known to the Bureau and who is close

to subject and the Tampa rackets,

Da racist 29

has advised that subject was

last contacted by him on August 29, 1961, at which time subject

said he was going to Miami.

Therefore 41-PCI cannot ascertain

subject's exact whereabouts. TP 50-РСI,

whose identity is known

to the Bureau and who is close to subject and a part of the bolita

racket, has advised that subject went back to Miami, and subject,

being more or less competitive 1f in bolita, would not necessarily

reveal his operation to this source.

Even though the Tampa Office has two top flight potential criminal

informants, additional coverage ís needed to not only substantiate

these sources but to keep advised as to subject's whereabouts;

movements and

activities.

12. Risks of detection involved:

Spot surveillances of the Dream Bar conducted in the past have

established that the bar is open from approximately 10:00 a.m. to

3:30 a.m., that the bar cannot serve alcoholic beverages after

3:00

a.m. but that patrons continue to stay until approximately

3:30

a.m. FANO TRAFFICANTE and the night bartender sometimes

spend up to an hour working about the bar, and when leaving turn

on all lights and raise the venetian blinds.

There is a very short

period of secure working time in the bar before the steady flow of

business traffic, as Nebraska Avenue is a main thoroughfare into

Tampa proper,

and a number of entries may be necessary.

In addition,

a fire at the bar was recently reported and verified.

Request made for technical surveillance by any outside agency

(name specific official, title and agency):
