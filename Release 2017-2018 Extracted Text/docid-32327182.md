EPSTEIN then advised BRODKIN that HENRY

to call on some accounts which HENRY has for EPSTEIN.

him that she could not reach SMITH at the number left.

conduct their business on that date, but that they would

also of necessity have to visit BILL KAPLAN in the hospital.

presently confined awaiting bond."

BRODKIN then made a

telephone call to Chicago bondsman EDDIE MORRIS and
