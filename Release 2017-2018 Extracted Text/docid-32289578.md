TP 92-1

Department, General Telephone Company of Fia., Tampa, Fla.

On 6/6/67, OM 148-C-TE, advised that approximately

three months ago, he had learned

that NICK CIVELLA,

who heads

the "outfit" in Kansas City, Missouri, and TRAFFICANTE were

taking over the bolita business in Florida and it appeared that

some of the bolita operators who were not giving in to them

were going to be

"cut up"

commented

as an example for others;

Informant

that CIVELLA and TRAFFICANTE are most friendly and that

there is no conflict existing between them and informant was

of the opinion that the recent killing of JOHN BIELE in Miami

could possibly stem from CIVELLA - TRAFFICANTE. Informant also

indicated that GEORGE POLERA of Daytona Beach,

Fla., is a wealthy

man and would like to get out of the outfit but is caught in the web

and

cannot get out. Informant mentioned that one CHARLES

"SNOOKS" HUTTER, a hoodlum, formerly residing in Omaha, is

currently operating H & H Used Car Lot in Daytona Beach, Fla.;

and is a front man for CIVELLA in that area.

Two T symbols are being used to appropriately conceal

the identity of TP 120-C as a safeguard in preventing this person's

identity becoming known due to the sensitive position which the

informant occupies.

On 6/27/67, T 120-C, advised SA JOHN A. AMBLER that

on an occasion in June, a package had been delivered by the

postman at the Tampa residence addressed to SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

2505 Bristol

Informant remarked at the time the package arrived,

TRAFFICANTE's daughter MARY JO PANIELLO was at the house, therefore,

the address of the sender was not obtained. Source mentioned that.

later was able to see that the package had been a book about the

size: of a telephone directory but much thinner and it was some

type of book containing pictures of individuals and group pictures.

Informant mentioned had only had a couple of minutes to examine book

and believes it was from some society with three initials

ard that

the

book was from Kansas City, Mo. Informant added on one page

had noticed a group picturesof about seven or eight men and that

one of the men pictured

was TRAFFICANTE but that in looking at the

names printed under the pictures, source noted that TRAFFICANTE'S

name did not appear under his picture but believed a name similar

to the three initials recently noticed on one of TRAFFICANTE'S

shirts was printed under TRAFFICANTE's picture., It is noted on

. B
