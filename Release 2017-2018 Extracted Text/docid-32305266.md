not hesitate to authorize a "hit.

The idea held by LA ROCCA that greater mutual

benefit and profit could result by peaceful arbitration

gradually proved its soundness to other racketeers in the

Pittsburgh area and the result is that there have been fewer

"mob killings" in the Pittsburgh district than in any other

city of comparable populationÂ®

Another result came about

because of this new LA ROCCA thinking.

All of the members

of La Cosa Nostra in the Pittsburgh area became "workers."

The old policy of having stooges and outsiders control the

operation of a gambling establishment while the leader sat

back and merely shared in the profits was abandoned.

according to this informant.

PG Tol advised that in the late 1920's and early

1930's, the two top groups in the Mafia in the Pittsburgh area

were headed by JOHN CANCELLIERI (deceased) of the North Side,

and the VOLPE brothers of Wilmerding, Pa., headed by JOHNNY

VOLPE (deceased), also known as "Prince Johnny." He stated

LOUIS VOLPE and JOE VOLPE are the younger surviving brothers.

The father of these two boys,

SAM, died in 1947, and was an active Mafia man.

but knows that meetings are held at the Rosa Villa Restaurant

between LA ROCCA, the MANNARINOs and TONY RIPEPI periodically.

and learned that the Mafia members

and the brother

of the victim witnessed the slaying, and

still would not admit to the Carabinieri that they saw

any-

thing.

Informant advised further regarding marriages that

formerly the members arranged the matches when their children

were still quite young. He stated a good example is the BAZZANO-

RIPEPI marriage.

* he has been

a long-time associate and friend of TONY RIPEPI. He further

stated that the marriage of TONY RIPEPI's oldest daughter

was arranged

in a like fashion.

In a like fashion. This VALENT is a brother of MeAN VALENT,

whom RIPEPI sponsored into La Cosa Nostra.

He advised further that STANLEY VALENTI refuses to

allow his wife to even visit her parents in Pittsburgh and

that he does not know the reason for this, but knows that

there is bad blood between them.

" The informant advised

regarding the term La Cosa Nostra, that he first heard this

used after the testimony of JOSEPH VALACHI. 'He advised he

'always knew of it locally as "The Outfit."

His interpretation

of the phrase La Cosa Nostra is "our own home" or "our own

well-being,! with emphasis on the

"our own."

PG T-5 has advised that when he was a boy in

Pittsburgh, "the syndicate". bombed a grocery store owned by

his father on Clay Way in the lower Hill District because

his father had refused to pay $10,000 which was demanded for

the protection of his property.

He recalled that the group picked only on Italians and not

on native-born American citizens because it was felt that

the Italians would not talk or report their troubles to the

police.

He stated that this group would actually seek out

laborers and hard-working people who were earning from $1.00

to $1.25 a day and extort their meager savings from them

through threats

Their targets were carefully selected

and each was sent a letter containing a small red mask.

They: obtained their name from this practice.

The aforementioned informant recalled that the

leader in the lower Hill District at the turn of the century

was DOMINICK DE FARNANDO, who was also known as "Don"

De Farnando. Following the bombing of his father's business

establishment, the police picked up this individual and

several of his associates but had to release them for lack

of evidence.

DE FARNANDO came to the father of the informant

and apologized to him and also told him that he was not

responsible for the bombing.

The following night, to the best

recollection of the informant, two Italian racketeers from

the Sharpsburg, Pa, area, were found at the bottom of a steep

ravine in Aspinwall., They had been knifed repeatedly.

In relation to the VOLPE family of Wilmerding, Pa.,

the informant advised that he has known

them for more than

50 years, and delivered groceries to their home as a boy.

He described them as "class Italians" in their day and

recalled that JOHN, also known as "Prince Johnny," was the

oldest son, who tried to move into the lower Hill Distriot in

the late 1920's and early 1930's in order to supervise the

lucrative booze business. He recalled that every day without

fail, JOHNNY went to a barber shop a few doors away from the

Roma Coffee Shop on Wylie Avenue, for a facial and manicure.

It was at this coffee shop that the triple killing of the

VOLPE brothers began. ARTHUR was hit first and JAMES was

killed at the counter. After being wounded, JOHNNY endeavored

to reach his Cadillac parked in front of the store, but fell

on the sidewalk and was shot again.

Accused of fingering the

"hit" was GAETANO BAZZANO and MIKE

SPINELLI was the actual

hit man. Both were subsequently killed by mob action outside

of Pittsburgh.

General Observations Relating to the Initiation

Ceremony

PG T-6 has advised that the code of the organization

in Pittsburgh, at the time of his initiation, was approximately

as follows:

"Honor is stressed as the most sacred thing

in the world.

To destroy another person must

be for honor

and not money alone.

A member is

warned never to engage in an affair with the

wives of other members. A member

must never

engage in white slavery or narcotics, both

crimes which are degrading to the name of the

organization.

A member must obey the

complaints

and instructions of his superior and is never

to take the life of a fellow member before

presenting his grievance to the Commission.

A

nember must do nothing which would affect the

organization without first receiving permission

from a superior. ":
