SUBJECT:

POTENTIAL CRIMINAL INFORMANT (PCI)

SUE YOUNG, HOLLYWOOD, CALIF., CALL GIRL

The captioned individual is a high-priced Hollywood call girl and

a close friend of Fred Otash, private detective in Los Angeles who has been

convicted of horse race fixing. She advised Agents of our Los Angeles Office

I on July 11, 1960, that Otash contacted her on 7-10-60 requesting information

relating to her participation in sex parties involving Senator John; Kennedy, his

brother-in-law, movied actor Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr.

Sue Young said she told Otash she had no knowledge of such activities

involving these men. He then asked her to name any girls who might have been

present at parties with these men.

She told the Agents that she was unaware of

any indiscretions or girls involved with the four men specified by Otash.

On July 11, 1960, Los Angeles Agents had occasion to talk to Otash

in his office. During the conversation he inadvertently--or his actions indicated

inadvertance=-that some operator, unnamed and unidentified, was attempting to spy

on Senator Kennedy's hotel room.

He interred to the Agents that "Confidential"

magazine is "looking for dirt on Kennedy or Lawford' for use in a series of articles

planned for publication before the November election.

In the evening of 7-11-60 Sue Young told Agents that Otash had

telephoned her wanting to know if she could arrange to be introduced to

Senator Kennedy. He suggested that he would like to equip her with a recording

device for taking down any "indiscreet statements" the Senator might make. She

said she refused this suggestion and invitation.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.
