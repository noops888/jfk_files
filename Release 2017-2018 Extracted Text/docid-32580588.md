Investigation By. Internal Revenue. Service

"The quarterly report for the period 6/1 to 9/1/63

submitted by Special Agent VERNON E. LYNCH, Internal

Revenue Service (IRS), Los Angeles concerning his investigation

of ROSSELLI under the

heading "Agent's Current Evaluation

of Criminal Potential"

There is currently no evidence of any unreported

income on the part of Mr: ROSSELLI.

His known bank accounts

do not reflect deposits in excess of his reported income.

His known net worth does not reflect any unreported income,

and his

accountants have presented documents to

substantiate all but a very small portion of the items

contained on his tax returns. His expenditures are being

analyzed to determine if they exceed his available sources

of income.

It appears they do not.

It is believed that

unless the investigative efforts during this succeeding

period produces specific items of unreported income this

investigation will be recommended to be closed on the basis

of a non-prosecution report to be completed not later than

November 30, 1963.

symbols were

utilized only in those

instances where the identities of the sources must-be concealed.
