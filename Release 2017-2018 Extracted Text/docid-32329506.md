actually FERRELL's girl friend and he got her into it.

ALDERISIO instructed FERRELL,_

and CATUARA to return

the $2,000 to the female so she could return same to ultimate

victims. ALDERISIO told CATUARA he would "make it up to

him in some other way." During the course of this meeting,

it was apparent from tenure of conversation that CATUARA

stature in the Chicago area organized crime structure than

ALDERISIO.

Also during this meeting, ALDERISIO learned from

CATUARA and

that FERRELL had been receiving a 10%

cut of Worldwide Mortgage Corporation activities through

use of FERRELL's office space at Wheeling, Illinois, where-

upon ALDERISIO became extremely provoked because FERRELL had

failed to turn over any of his 10% cut to ALDERISIO.

FERRELL

was ordered by ALDERISIO to immediately get out of the

Wheeling office and confine his activities to First National

Mortgage Company business at Chicago, Illinois.

JOT STEIN explained to ALDERISIO a deal between

himself,

that he and FIDANZI had no fee

entailed in this collection.

ALDERISIO advised CATUARA

that some times a favor is done for a bank in order to

obligate the bank to return a favor in the future, which

is of material assistance in the operation of a mortgage

brokerage business.

During the course of the conversation, ALDERISIO

desired to be apprised of the identity and capacity of

and GUS RUBINO in the mortgage brokerage field.

It is noted previous information concerns the

negotiation of a dispute between two factions of the Chicago

hoodlum element.

It is further noted ALDERISIO and CATUARA

were not previously known to be closely associated, and they

operate in different sections of the Chicago area.
