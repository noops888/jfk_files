at about 2115 and took hin to the Stater Hotel. He toid ne that in lato

January or early february he had begun aczing as broker for some exchange

tragations involving Cuban pedo in the putta posseson of formos

Batista followers in the Miand area. During the course of these transacticas

he became acquainted with a number of Cubans, most of them former followers

of Satista who are engaged in plotting against the CASTLO Guverment in

Cuba.

2. Together with Maruel Firestone, aka Manuel refog(a US eitizen of

Cuban oristn who served in the ICa during world liar II and one of the US

ared forces during the Korean war) Wer Bell went to the Dominican Republic

about 6 weeks ago. The purpose of the trip was to see Batista and sell him

on a public relations campaign which might help his restablish his

reputation in the United Sties.

her Bell did nos see Batista personally,

but itt Firestone did. ker Bell met with a rumber of Cuban exiles on

raríors occasions and becare convinced that it was not possible to deal with

Batista since tre latter insisted on postponing ererything "until he comes

to the States". Firestone arranged to bring her seil into contact with Gen

jose Pedrag and separateis, leando hodrigues, Man. el De lora's nephew, and

through him Manuel De Moga. He discussed only a mitile relations campalga

o7 behale of the Dominican Fevolic with le tofa.

night he irplied to me that he had had combal experience. My personal assess-

nent of fier tell follows at the end of this menorandum.) fier Bell said he

asked PedrazA1f he was in touch with CIA. Pedrazasald he was not in contact

but that the others, reaning the Deminicans, were, Wer Bell said the Cubang

are training a minimin of 2, 000 troops in the Dominican Republic, There are

also about « 1,000 Spandards wout sent by FRA'CO. her tell said he

recouvended to Pedrazaa typical bee et operation to organize a poor fiel

CORIRILLEI

guerrilla ares, with supoly drops, and the organization of extensive communi

cation facilities.

Lo Batista has refisco to cooperate with Pedrazland lo is refusing

to provide any funds for the operation. He says that he essects to be in

the Inited States within the weeks and will then negotlate provisioned of

support. Rolando Kansferred 1s collecting funds in the US for the revolt.

In addition to this, the Dominicans are buying arms wherever they can get

their hands on then. Tre plan is to make Munez Portiondo Provisional

President as

soon as CASTRO is overthrown.

So lier Bell cata that an excan

businessman naned jones fru, who

strascar does business in Europe

and kar in Mlant by'ing real estete,

had mentioned to hin the possibility of obtaining the services of 1,000

experienced Gernan combat troops who are organized, officered, and equipped,

Loosfoes

at the rate of $100 a day per man. An individual naned hand, belleved to

be a Swiss staying at the laldorf Astoria Hotel, 1s the contact for getting

the services of these somans. Los 19 merely an intermediary and Fres (mi,

whose nationality 1s uninowi, but bellered so be & jerman, 1s the principal

of this ercup. (Contents when i questicned her bezl about this he wis

very reluctant to go into detalls, and as the story developed it appeared

to me that he was taking for granted a typical night club story resulting

from loose talk ky hirself and the individual called iones.)

6o lier tell said he had been virtually offered command of the Cuban

counter revolutionary force. He said that he w1ll engage in this only 15

CIA backs him up. He sants to organize a para-military force and needs 15

to 20 Py experts including communicators to brain the force. de also wants

sore specialized equipment such as fire borbs, radios, and even mentiored

2L-F8l aircraft. (Comments I believe the Dominicans have been trying to

buy euch aircraft for sone time for from the Canadian Government. The

Canadiens, however, hara refused it the United States' request to grant

export licenses for the planes.)

To lier Bell wants to see Gen. Cabell or Allen Dulles on this matter.

He says he is willing to aet as our agent and believes he can gain the

completo confidence of Pedrazand De Moya. He sald that it 18 rupored in

Marl that the Untted States had offerdf76 hours of hands off in the event

of an attempt against CASTIO and will close its eyes to a rumber of gun

shipments.

l. lier Bell admitted to me that he had had some business difficulties

In the recett past and was now working his way out of then. he have his

record through 19is and be appears to be a responsible citizen as of that

time. The inpression that I got of hin last night is that he is now à typical

8203

proncter type of the bast successful varlety found in Latin inerica, prones

to exagrerated ideas end sonerhat naive,as evidenced by his story of the

1,000 Germans. I carefully avoided the question of what he stands to

gain by all of this, but as the story developed it becomes rather obvious

that ke l9 seeking to ast a a broker a CIA sypot for Pedraza and probably

anticipates collecting his brokerage fees in tems of publie relations con-

tracts wax fron the Dominicans and the new Cuban Government. It 1s also

obvious that Subject has good access to intelligence which may be of consid

erable value, particularly 11 it becomes necessary to initiate political

action operations against the CASTRO Covernment.
