Reourcable 4/22/59 and Chicago letterhead memo

On 6/18/59 Dr. ALFRED CARREL, Swiss Central Police

Bureau, Bern, Switzerland, reported that investigation at

Switzerland, has failed to show that GUS ALEX

st Mn tat locality during March 1959. Further, additional

inquiry by the Swiss has revealed that it appears improbable

that subject was involved in the burglary of a jewelry shop at

St. Moritz, Switzerland, March 4, 1959.

The Swiss now believe

that this burglary was the work of Italian hoodlums.

As soon as the results of additional inquiry at Sto

Moritz, particularly the results of fingerprint comparison

and deplay of All photograph is recelved, the Bureau wIza

be advised.
