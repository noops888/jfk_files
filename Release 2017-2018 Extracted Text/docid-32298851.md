Re Chicago airtel summary, 12/30/60.

Reference is made to Chicago daily summary airtel

dated 11/14/60 in case captioned "ACTIVITIES OF TOP HOODLUMS

IN THE CHICAGO AREA, AR".

Information was received from

Company and the difficulties this company had been encountering

with the Garbage Disposal Association.

Apparently the

association had been utilizing pressure in order to stop

the Standard Disposal Company from expanding their business.

It was MURRAY HUMPHREYS contention that an Antitrust suit

should be filed against the Disposal Association and go

through legitimate channels to exert pressure against the

association rather than using muscling tactics. (7)

un and Brad Street Inc., report dated 5/2/60,

'eveals that the Standard Disposal

and Metal Company,

Inc., formerly at 55 East 18th Street, Chicago, had moved

to 1216 South Sangamon.

Its officers

were listed as

BERNARD LU

treasurer:

just started and financial details were lacking.

LOEBENBERG

operated the Standard Coffee Service, Inc., at 55 East 18th

Street and according to this

report was at

that time still

active in that business. (Ul,

CG 6283-C advised on 1/4/81, that the Standard

Disposal and Metal Company is a hgodlum controlled operation.

The informant stated that LENNIE PATRICK (Chicago toi

hoodlum) and DAVE TARAS (known to the Miami Office) are FlA

working together arranging and lining up stops and customers

for this disposal company. Informant said that he knew for

a fact that PATRICK had approached the owner of Marty's

Food Mart, Inc., to line up this individual as a customer

for Standard Disposal Company.

It was the same person who

was the victim of LENNIE PATRICK's muscling tactics in a

shake-down of super markets in 1958. (V)

On 1/5/61, SAS RALPH R. HILL and VINCENT L. INSERRA

interviewed DAVE, KAYE who identified himself as the sales

director and vice president of the Standard Disposal and

Metal Company at 1216 South Sangamon.

KAYE was interviewed

in his office at that address.

KAYE was visibly disturbed

over the presence of agents and commented immediately to

the agents that he is a parolee from the State of Florida

and had been convicted of attempted murder in Miami in

1954, however, would not go into lengthy detail as to

circumstances

surrounding his conviction other then to

state that he was sent to Miami from Chicago in 1951 by

AlLILL

Chicago.

KAYE was sent to Miami as deputy receiver and

organizer in an attempt to organize the Laundry Workers

in the south Florida area.

KAYE advised that his Florida

penitentiary number was 53473 and that he was paroled

from the Florida Pepitentiary on March 24, 1959, and his

parole was sponsored by EUGENE JAMES. KAYE stated he

received a 20 years sentence and his parole expires in 1975(4)

KAYE said that the Standard Disposal and Metal

Company was organized about a year ago and now has 175 to

180 stops, both residential and industrial, picking up

garbage and scrap.

He said that they have been in difficulty

with the Salvage Association which has,according to KAYE,

"formed a monolopy for restraint of trade" and that the

association is attempting to put them out of business by

closing them out of dumping grounds, pressuring trucking

companies to keep them from purchasing trucks and using

economic pressure on their potential customers. KAYE

insisted that the business has been obtained by underselling

competition, that this is strictly legitimate and that no

muscling tactics

are utilized.

He said that he knows DAVE

YARAS "slightly" but denied knowing LENNIE PATRICK. He stated

that neither YARAS nor PATRICK are at this time working for

this company and to the best of his knowledge have never

been utilized as salesmen for the Standard Disposal.(U)

He said the operations of the Standard Disposal

Company are financed by the Guaranteed Trust and Savings.

It is noted that the Guaranteed Trust was formerly the

Southmoor Bank and Trust, whose president was LEON MARCUS,

slain in gangland style in 1956; after which much speculation

was made to the effect

that the

killing was carried out under

orders of GIANCANA. (4)

On 1/5/61, GIANCANA was observed at the, Armory

Lounge in the evening hours in company with NICK D'AMICO

JOHN JJARELLI, and JOE/MARKS.

GIANCANA was observers

being dropped at the Armory Lounge from a car occupied by

GIANCANA and two other individuals.

This automobile after

dropping GIANCANA proceeded to 915

Franklin Street in

River Forect where it was observed that ANtHONY JOSEPH

ACCARDO departed from this vehicle and proceeded into his

residence at that address. (Y)

CG 6428-C advised that GUS' Steak House in Cicero,

mentioned previously, utilizes gambling on the.

second floor

and that the whole layout is operated by FRANKISHARKEY, an

ex-convict. SHARKEY is probably FRANK "Sharkey" FULO,

1104 South Maple, Oak Park, Illinois, a known close associate

Of GIANCANA'S. (4)

The Miami Office is requested to furnish to Chicago

all available information pertaining to DAVE KAYE, mentioned

herein.

The

Jacksonville Office is requested to obtain

all available information from the Florida Penitentiary

System regarding KAYE under Florida State Penitentiary

number 53473. (4)
