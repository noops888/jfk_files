Mandit;

1962, Is repetitious. Furthermore, it is believed that

the individual exiled groups in Miami definitely

exaggerate the strength and scope of the activities of

their counterparts in Cuba. Objective comments from

people not directly affiliated with any particular group

but active in underground operations substantiates this

view.

In addition, recent information indicates that

CIA has infiltrated a number of people into Cuba and that

these Individuals are possibly more active than the

unsupported counter-revolutionary groups. (ECH/u)
