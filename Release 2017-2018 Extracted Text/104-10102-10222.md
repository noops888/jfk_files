b. Putting the brakes on the PSP's grab

for power.

C.

Castigating Escalante for personal

"sectarianism".

I. A New View on Splitting the Regime:

1.. Castro's purge of Escalante surfaced his

concern for the balance between the non-comnunist

elements of the 26th of July Movement and the

"unaligned" government leader and the PSP - "old'

and "new".

2.. To split Castro from the PSP would be difficult

and of questionable value:

a. The PSP to gain its final objective would

take any insult and turn the other cheek.

It had embraced Fidel and would not let go

under any circumstances. To rise against

Castro now would not be opportune, and

would probably be fatal.

b. Fidel was now totally dependent on the

Soviet Union

The only hope was not to split Fidel from

PSP but to identily, at every opportunity,

hin and his government-with communisu, for

only the non-communist element of the 26th

of July Movement and the "unalighed leaders

of the government could effectively be

split

from the government.

This conclusion did not preclude the Task

Force from attempts to create suspicion,

hostility and friction between Castro and

the PSP.

II. The Direction of Task Force Efforts to Split the Regime:

To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement

and other "unaligned" government leaders

who were for

the revolution but against communism. To date, there

is reasonably good ividence indicating that the

following Individuals do not approve of the communist

direction of the Cuban revolution and may in lact

be conspiring against the regime.

1. Major Pedro Miret Prieto, commanding artillery unit

Ambassador Gustavo Arcos y Bergnes

3. Connander Sebastian Arcos, brother of Gustavo rnd

a commander in the Cuban havy. Has been in Prague

for some time on a training mission

Our main efforts to contact them take two
