NOTE FOR: All Historical Review Group Members

SUBJECT:

Procedure--JFK Assassination Review/Congressionally-

originated Documents

We have been

requested by the Office of Congressional

Affairs (OCA) to institute special handling for Congressionally-

originated documents that appear in the JFK Assassination

Collection that HRG is reviewing.

Specifically, OCA asks that we

segregate such documents and retain them, rather than send them

to the National Archives, at least for the time being.

Examples

of such documents would be letters to the DCI from HSCA Chairman

(This is subject to

stokes, notes taken by HSCA staffer instructions from congress.)

change once the Agency has received

Therefore, we are to implement the following procedure for

congressionally-originated documents:

- Remove the document from the box, substituting a

withdrawal card in the box.

- Review the document for Agency equities and so note them,

leaving the document intact.

- Retain the document in a separate, temporary file,

recording the box in which the document

was located.
