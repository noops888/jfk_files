of good tap operations.

The stress. of the paper 1e on intelligence

The tough problem, of course, will be to sanitize too paper

without downgrading the operations.

The essence of the messago 1a

that so much cas be done, and son all, by relatively few people,

proviied these ler people have the right artile and musticient drive..

Fo alght onlt all references to latta laerica, the Spanish lizuge,

and Cuban ense officers; no nigit even thror in 1 few sislending pirases

1ike "the fanaray Caban target.*

Fe certainly rould aot vast the

location to ba rocognized orcart by persons alrendy familiar with the

operations.

No will be guided by yow wishes in tals and other aspects
