TESTIMONY OF ANN GOODPASTURE

MI. Goldsmith. Would you state your name and address

for the reCord?

Ms. Goodpastrue. My name is Ann Goodpasture. My locäl

address is with friends in Maryland, 5600 Bridgeview.

My mailing address, at the moment, is in care of my

father in Livingstone, Tennessee.

MI. Fithian. If I may, now that we have your name on

the record and your address, I would like to explain our

proceedings here, Miss Goodpasture.

The House Resolution 222, under which this Subcommittee

acts, mandates that the Committee conduct a full and complete

investigation and study of the circumstances surrounding the

assassination and the death of President John F. Kennedy

including deternining whether the existing laws of the United

States concerning the protection of the President and the

investigatory jurisdiction and capability of agencies and

departments are adequate in their provisions and enforcement;

and whether there was full disclosure of evidence and informa

tion among agencies and departments of the United States

government; and whether any information or evidence not in

the possession of an agency or department would have been of

assistance in investigating the assassination; and why such

information was not provided or collected by that

agency or

department; and to make recommendations to the House, if the

Select Committee deems it appropriate, for the amendment of

existing legislation or the enactment of new legislation.

I would like, because of the special expertise of this

witness, if counsel will withhold for just a moment, say a

word of two about the process that we are engaged in.

First, we commend you for your long years of service

to a very, very important agency of this government. I

personally was a part of that in a very, very small way in

the Navy a long time ago, and I commend you for your dedica-

tion and your experience and what has come to be your reputa-

tion for, as we have talked with other members of the agency,

they have referred to you as sort of the touchstone, or the

person who was the expert among the experts.

I want to say also that I personally want to commend

our Chief Counsel, Professor Blakey, and our assistant

counsels for their long and dilligent effort to build a

relationship with the agencies which is now beginning to be

extremely productive and fruitful in our whole process of

trying to get all the information and to lay the matter of

the assassination of the President of the United States to

rest permanently with the complete story.

I just wanted you to know that we have been working

with the CIA and the FBI and they have been very cooperative

with us as well as the State. Department in the two investi

gations in which we are now engaged; and I look forward to

Ms. Goodpasture. I read this yesterday.

Mr. Goldsmith. - Exhibit No. 94 is a copy of a letter

written by the present Director of Central Intelligence to the

Chairman of this Committee. I believe a copy was given to

you yesterday, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you read that letter yesterday?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you understand that letter?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated that you worked with the

Central Intelligence Agency for 31 years. Which branch within

the CIA did you work for?

Ms. Goodpasture. For the entire length of time?

Mr. Goldsmith.

Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I worked for a number of

different branches, but most of the time I was outside of the

United States and it came under what is now called the

Director of Operations, or clandestine service. I suppose

that would be a more appropriate term.

MI. Goldsmith. Fine.

When did you retire from the CIA?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think it was in June, 1973.

Mr. Goldsmith. Miss Goodpasture, I am drawing your

attention to 1963. Where were you stationed at that time?

MI. Goldsmith. Who was the Chief of Station?

Ms. Goodpasture. Winston Scott.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it appropriate to refer to you as

having been Winston Scott's righthand man during your term

of service in Mexico City?

MS. Goodpasture. I take exception to that. First of

all, I am not a man; and second, I think that his righthand

person was his Deputy who participated in all the decision

making processes, which I did not, and acted for Mr. Scott

in his absence.

A lot of people said that I was Winn's right hand because g

at times he asked me to do things for him that he did not ask

other people to do. He depended upon me for certain projects

that he managed, or he wanted to manage, and I did the legwork

for it.

I would not say that I was his right hand in the entire

station.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated that you were not

involved in the actual decision-making process. Were you

privy to the actual decision-making process?

Ms. Goodpasture. It depended upon what it concerned.

If it was a project that I worked on, I participated in it,

but if it were a station activity, I did not.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did your work at the station in Mexico

City also involve occasionally making contact with CIA agents

in the field?

Ms. Goodpasture: Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you give the Congressional panel

an evaluation of Winn Scott's competence as the Chief of

Station?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I think that he was a very

conscientious man, he was a hardworking man, he expected

everyone else to do their work, he worked long hours. Some

people felt, or expressed the opinion, in my presence, that

he was a hard worker and expected too much from employees,

but I do not think that that was really the case.

He was

a very conscientious man, an intelligent man. He obviously

had the intelligence for the post, or he would not have been

assigned there.

MI. Goldsmith. Is the Mexico City station one of the

largest CIA stations in operation?

Ms• Goodpasture, At the present time, I do not know.

official files that could be destroyed without a certificate

of destruction being made.

That did not apply to our rough

notes that we made, but you could not take a file out, go

through it and tear it up because you did not like something

in it.

Mr. Goldsmith. It has been said of Mr. Scott that

during his tenure in Mexico City not even a shred of paper

was thrown out or moved from the Mexico City station files.

Would you say that is an accurate statement?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Some of the rough paper was thrown

out, the rough paper that he considered supporting data for a

dispatch that he had written or a cable that he sent, he kept.

He insisted that other people do the same thing.

Mr. Goldsmith, Fine.

At this time, I am going to get into the area of the

surveillance operations in Mexico City:

Miss Goodpasture, what kinds of surveillance operations

did the CIT have in Mexico City in 1963 with respect to the

Soviet and Cuban consulate and embassies?

Ms, Goodpasture. Well, we had electronic surveillance,

wiretaps, which covered telephone conversations.

MI. Goldsmith. If I may interrupt you for a moment, coula

you possibly raise the mike closer to your mouth so that we

might hear you better?

Ms. Goodpasture.

We had electronic surveillance,

wiretaps on the telephones in the Soviet Embassy, and we had

photographic surveillance.

There was also what they called foot surveillance at

times, when people were interested, they could find out where

they were staying, where they went from the Soviet Embassy.

MI. Goldsmith. That would be physical surveillance?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Turning first to the area of photographic

surveillance, what was the purpose of the photographic

surveillance project with regard to the Soviet and Cuban

embassies and consuls?

Ms. Goodpasture. My understanding of that was that it

was to be used to identify those people who night be working

for the Soviets as espionage agents who were U.S. citizens

who went down there driving a car with a U.S. license plate

on it, or people we did not know but could identify.

The same procedure was also used for trying to identify

people other than U.S. citizens, but it was concentrated in

the beginning on license plates or rumbers, or something that

could be identified.

Mr. Goldsmith. An attempt would be made to take pic-

tures of both the car, license plates and the occupants of

the car, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

At that time, it was one of the largest ones in Latin America,

but not in comparison to the other places. I could not

comment

• on the size of the other places.

Mr. Goldsmith. What kind of attitude did Mr. Scott

have towards the importance of files and recordkeeping systems

at the Mexico City station?

Ms. Goodpasture. He was very conscientious. He wanted

them maintained accurately and completely.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long were the files that he main-

tained preserved?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I am not too sure about that.

They were there up until the time that I left, but I think

that there was a reduction because of space in 1969. 'The

files were cut back, but I do not have firsthand knowledge

of that because I did not participate in it.

Mr. Goldsmith. During the time that you were in Mexico

City with MI. Scott, to your knowledge was anything ever

thrown out of destroyed from the Mexico City station files?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, several things were destroyed

that. were.not considered of any value as far as the work at

that time was concerned.

We looked at it more or less like

keep cash register receipts for a grocery bill. There was a

limitation of space on just how long you could keep certain

things.

But there were no documents that were a part of the

Turning now to the photographic surveillance operation

with regard to the Soviet Embassy and consulate, I would

like to ask you, what role, if any, did you play with regards

to this surveillance operation during 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. In 1963, I was more or less a bystander

of that operation because the operation, at times, was conducted

by another case officer.

I screened and looked at the photographs because I had

been there in the early part of the operation where the

photograph bases were first set up, were first used. I had

an interest in them, or looked at them to see that they were

in focus, that the negatives were all printed, and Mt..

Scott. asked me to do that because I had been a commercial

photographer before I went to work for the

government

MI. Goldsmith, Are you saying, in 1963, your roll

with regard to the photographic surveillance at the Soviet

Embassy was to review photographs, essentially to evaluate

their quality?

Ms • Goodpasture.

Their technical quality.

Mr. Goldsmith, Not for the purpose of obtaining subser

quent information from the photographs?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, because, at that time, by 1963

there was a staff there who had been assigned to work on

Soviet matters and it was their function to investigate the

leads - we called them leads -- to try to identify the person

at the Soviet embassy they were interested in

So all the raw material went to them. I usually took

a quick look at the photographs when they came in, and if

I noticed anything significant about them, I mentioned it to

the Soviet case officer, but he gave the formal reporting on

all the Soviet information.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand.

How many cameras were in operation with regard to the

photosurveillance of the Soviet Embassy and consulate?

Ms. Goodpasture. Three. There were three, generally.

There could be any number:

if we wanted to put some on

the street, but at that time, I think there were only three.

Mr. Goldsmith. Where were these cameras located?

Ms. Goodpasture. Where?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture. They were located around the building.

the embassy building, to cover the area in the yard and in

the front gate.

Ms. Goldsmith, So the cameras were sitiated so that

they would photograph the yard area and front entrance gate?

Ms . Goodpasture.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith.

During this period, was your role with

regards to this project at any time of a supervisory nature,

actually supervising the project?

in that way, but I never had the responsibility for them

Me. Goldsmith.

• As a practical matter, you were acting

in an informal supervising capacity?

Ms. Goodpasture. It could have been interpreted that

way by some of the people, because they would come to me and

bring me photographs and say, what do you think of this, do

you think that this is a latin, or do you think he has ever

been to the Soviet Embassy before.

Mr. Goldsmith.

In your own opinion do you think you

were acting, at least informally, in a supervisory capacity

with regards to this project?

Ms, Goodpasture.

No.

Mr. Goldsmith. At this time, I would like for the

witness to be

given Stack C of the documents that have been

prepared.

I would like to draw your attention to page 2 of the

documents that appear in Stack C.

Ms. Goodpasture.

Yes

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to ask you if you can

identify that document.

Ms. Goodpasture. This looks like a copy of a cable sent

from the Mexico station on the 8th of October.

Mr. Goldsmith.

To whom would the cable have been sent?

Ms. Goodpasture. What was that again?

Mr. Goldsmith. I am sorry. I am drawing your atten-

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. The second word --

Ms. Goodpasture. Page two?

Mr. Goldsmith. Page two. There appears a word "the

envoy." What does that word mean?

Ms. Goodpasture. That was a cryptonym to identify

the telephone surveillance, Instead of saying a telephone

tap operation we used crytonyms for all of the things that

involved assets outside that could be identified.

MI. Goldsnith. I am not drawing your attention to the

upper lefthand corner of this document. There appears the

word "orig." What does that stand for?

Ms, Goodpasture. The person who wrote the cable.

Mr. Goldsmith. Does that stand for originating officer?

Ms. Goodpasture. The originating officer is Mr. Herbert

Who is identified in the upper lefthand corner as the

Does it say L.A. Dilinger?

Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture. Right:

Mr. Goldsmith. It is a pseudonym for Herbert Minell?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

MI. Goldsmith. I take it that these documents commonly

used pseudonymns, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture.

In almost all cases that was the

practice.

Mr. Goldsmith. What would be the purpose of using a

pseudonyn?

Ms, Goodpasture.

In case the document happened to fall

outside classified control, it would be meaningless to the

people who picked it up than if the true name were on it.

Ms. Goodpasture. The supervisor, the person who decides:

that the message should be sent; generally the releasing offi-

cer is the chief, the senior person there at the time, the

person who will assume responsibility for the message after

it has been transmitted.

MI. Goldsmith. The message would.

Ms. Goodpasture. For instance, in an Embassy, if a

document goes to the communications center signed by someone

who is not the senior person in the section, they will not

send it; just everybody cannot take a message to the message

center and say, send this cable to Washington.

So this is to make sure that the Chief of the Section

knows that is going on by everybody in his section,

MI. Goldsmith. I would not like to draw your attention

to page 5 of Stack C. That pertains to a different cable, but

simply for the purpose of clarifying terminology, I would

like you to look at the lower righthand corner where it says,

"Authenticating Officer."

What is an authenticating officer?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, this cable originated in

Washington and in Washington there are more than one chief,

so the person who signs off on it -- it may be a Branch Chief.

In this case, it was the Division Chief.

He approved sending the cable and then his superior

released it.

Mr. Goldsmith.

So the authenticating officer woüld be

someone under the releasing officer, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, to be sure about that, you

would have to check with the communications people on their

practices, but I think that sometimes it could be the sane.

If

the authenticating officer were the Section Chief,

then the Section Chief could also release the message.

Me. Goldsmith.

Were you ever an authenticating officer?

Ms: Goodpasture. No, Well, I have signed off on cables

going out from Headquarters at times, I am sure.

Mr, Goldsmith. Only from Headquarters?

Ms. Goodpasture. The fact that you sign there as an

authenticating officer does that mean that that is a title,

It means that you were the person who were probably best

informed on that subject, I think.

it the responsibility of the authenticating officer to verify

the contents of the cable?

Ms. Goodpasture. It might be, I do not know.:

Mr. Goldsmith.

What would the specific purpose of an

authenticating officer be?

Ms. Goodpasture. I never went into that terminology

with anyone.

Mr Fithian. Would the counsel permit a question?

MI (Goldsmith. Yes, sir.

MI. Fithian. In our Navy communications sytem, we

sometimes distinguished between an authenticating officer as

one who not only authorized the sending of the cable, but

authenticated or verified or vouched for, the content.

Is that similar?

Ms, Goodpasture. That would be the literal interpre-

tation of the word. Whether ornot it was used in air traffic

all the time or not, I do not know.:

My guess would be that that is correct.

MI. Fithian. Do you know whether, in CIA traffic,

you had to have both an authenticating officer and a releasing

officer for a single message?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that there were times when one

person could sign both places.

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know. You would have to

compare the field forms and headquarters forms to be sure

of that.

working hours frequently. Their consulate might be open from

8:00 to 10:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays or they

might change it fron 10:00 to 12:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

But for me to say now that in September, 1963, without having

document to prove it, that they were open from 10:00 to

12:00 would be rather foolish because I really do not know

what their hours were at that time.

Ms. Goodpasture, We are talking about two different

things here. The surveillance, someone was available there,

but they did not make pictures. They may have been watching

the activity from 9:00 o'clock in the morning until 1:00

o'clock and may have only made two pictures, one at 11:00

and one at 12:00.

As far as photographic surveillance being continuous,

that would be really inaccurate because it was not a camera

making a picture of every minutels activity.

Mr. Goldsmith

However, there were personnel stationed

at positions outside. the Soviet Embassy compound who had

photographic equipment available and who could take pictures

at any time during daylight hours, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know whether it would be or

not. At any time during daylight hours?

MI. Goldsmith. I am drawing your attention to the

second paragraph of this document, page 1, the very first

sentence of that paragraph. It says the photographic

coverage of the mentioned installations is of a continuous

nature during daylight hours. Is that an accurate statement?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think in November of 1973 --

Mr. Goldsmith,

Ms, Goodpasture, -- after the assassination, the case

officers ordered their people to be on duty continuously. I

to be used as background material to try to get together the

information about what was the situation in Mexico at the

time of Oswald's visit and the assassination and to name

people who were there that we could talk to and locate their

records and get as complete a report as we could on what

happened there.

Mexico City, why were you specifically asked to prepare this

memorandum?

Ms, Goodpasture. I do not think anybody else was will-

ing to do it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it possible that you were asked to

prepare this memorandum because you had more information

concerning this issue?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, I was asked to do it because the

man who was reviewing it had never been at the Mexico station

and it is just as though he was asked to write a report on this

committee; that he wanted someone that had been in Mexico.

of the date.

Mr. Goldsmith. Understood.

However, you continued working in this particular

capacity through 1964. Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Only when the other people were away,

met someone outside. That was the function of the alternate

Mr. Goldsmith, What was Thomas Keehan's responsibility

in regards to this project?

Ms. Goodpasture. He was a case officer.

Mr. Goldsmith. According to page 19, he served in that

capacity from June '63 until October '64, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think so.

Mr. Goldsmith. When you say case officer, you mean

case

officer with regard to the Soviet Embassy photosurveil-

lance coverage?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that when Thomas Keehan

received the materials from the photosurveillance operation

he would turn them over, either to you or to Herbert Minell?

Ms. Goodpasture. He sometimes brought the photographs

in to me and I gave them to Herb Minell. On other occasions,

he would give it to Herb Minnel directly:

MI. Goldsmith. Is it true that Keehan's responsibility

in this area was simply to do the leg work on the project,

that he himself was not really in charge of the project?

Ms. Goodpasture. Nl, he managed the projects also. He

had complete supervision of the projects, as well as the lẹg

work.

Ms. Goodpasture, Tom Keehan,

Mr. Goldsmith. Are you certain that the person respon-

sible for that was not yourself?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

MI. Goldsmith. Are you certan that you were not

responsible for setting those requirements and policies?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Are you referring to asking people

to asking for coverage over a specific investigation?

Mr. Goldsmith. My question is directed towards whether

you were involved in a supervisory capacity with setting the

requirements and policies as to how the photosurveillance

operation would be run.

Ms. Goodpasture. I talked to him about it, but this

was his sole responsibility at the time. He was the case

officer for the project.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that, because of the sensi-

tivity of the photosurveillance operation at the Soviet

Embassy that winn Scott felt that you were the person who

should run this operation?

Ms. Goodpasture.

I do not think I heard that statement

before. He did not want too many people involved in it

because of the sensitivity and he asked me to review the photo-

graphs to make sure that the outside people did not become

sloppy in the photographic work.

MI. Goldsmith. Nevertheless, did Winn Scott place you

in a supervisory capacity with regard to this project?

Ms. Goodpasture. No. I never saw anything in writing

that referred to me as supervising the activities of that

project.

Mr. Goldsmith. If not in writing, nevertheless, informally

did winn Scott designate you as the person who would be super-

vising that project?

Ms. Goodpasture.

He may have said informally, I want

you to make sure that those operations are run properly, or

something like that, but I do not think he did. I do not

recall him doing that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it true that MI. Keenan was the most

junior officer in the station in 1963?

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it

also true that the Soviet opera-

tion, in terms of surveillance of the Soviet Embassy, was an

extremely sensitive operation?

Ms. Goodpasture, It was not any more sensitive than

the other operations which Mr. Keehan was handling. In fact,

MI. Keehan was probably the person most trusted by Winn

Scott.

tion was one of the most sensitive operations that was in

effect in Mexico City in 1963?

Ms• Goodpasture. I doubt it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you characterize that operation

as extremely sensitive?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you characterize that surveil-

lance operation as extremely sensitive?

Ms. Goodpasture. It was - I would characterize it as

sensitive to the extent that the Chief of Station did not want

the photographs disseminated and the sourte identified, for

that reason it was considered sensitive. But every project

that we had was also considered sensitive that involved a

source who would be in jeopardy if they were identified.

Mr. Goldsmith. If Mr. Keehan were to say that his

responsibility with regard to that project was simply to do

the legwork on it and not to act in a supervisory capacity,

would he be telling us the truth?

Ms. Goodpasture. When he first came there --

Mr.

Goldsmith. I believe that calls for a yes or no

answer.

Ms. Goodpasture. I am trying to figure out why someone

would make a statement of that type. He felt, I am sure, as

a young officer that he was only doing the legwork, but so

was I. Because the person who made the decisions was the

Chief of Station and his deputy, and they had the remainder

of the people in the station do the legwork, the running

around, meeting the agents, but when it came to make decisions

they made the big decisions, but I did not make any decisions

over Iom Keehan's work, if that is what you are

getting at.

MI. Goldsmith. With regards to this particular surveil-

lance operation, did you make the decisions on it, or did

Keehan make the decisions on it?

Ms. Goodpasture. He made the decisions on it. As far

as management of the project was concerned --

for getting the photographic film from the photography

surveillance site to the station?

Ms. Goodpasture. It was picked up at intervals by

meetings with the person outside.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long did it take?

Ms. Goodpasture. There, again, my memory is faulty.

Is that correct?

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

MI. Goldsmith. How long did this overall process take?

Ms. Goodpasture. My guess would be about a week from

the time that the film was exposed, but some of the film

might only be two days old or three days old.

In the roll of film, it would cover a period of one,

two or three days, so that the last day's coverage on the

film would be more recent than the first part of the film.

MI, Goldsmith. Would you

1 give the panel your evaluation

of the efficiency of the photosurveillance operation?

Ms: Goodpasture. Well, I think that it generally was

very good as far as the coverage was concerned. . If we asked

them to get a photograph of the events that occurred between

9:00 and 10:00 on such and such a date, they usually produced

the photographs for that period.

Mr. Goldsmith. What if they were not specifically asked

to focus on a person, as a matter of routine? How thorough

was the coverage?

Ms, Goodpasture. They covered the categories that we

asked the for on a routine basis, which was to identify any

people who appeared to be non-latin and any Soviets.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that was the purpose.

Given that purpose, how thorough was the coverage?

Ms: Goodpasture. I think it was accuzate.:

MI. Goldsmith, I would now like you to refer to page

20 of the document that you have before you in Stack A-3.

Seven lines from the bottom in the middle of the page, it says

"However."

Ms. Goodpasture.

Wait a minute.

(Pause):

Mr. Goldsmith. Seven lines fron the bottom, starting

with the word "However," I would like for you to read that.

Ms, Goodpasture, The last.

Mr. Goldsmith, "However, here again, there was." That

is what I am referring to. Just read that section please.

(Pause)

Is the information contained in that section starting

with "However" until the end of that page, accurate?

Ms. Goodpasture. Io the best of my knowledge it is;

but I am not so sure whether or not the cameras used a

separate roll of film for each day after the assassination or

before. I think it was after the assassination. That part

Eight here is not clear:

The reason I say it was after that period, because if

you will look at the log of the film that occurred in October

you will note more than one day on thatroll of film.

I am not sure. I

tried to speculate on that, but I am just not sure.

would you give?

I did not know if they were at the consulate entrance or the

Mx. Goldsmith. You say that Mr. Phillips was the

Chief during this period. According to your document on page

18, you also indicate that Mr. Shaw was the Chief of Cuban

Operations.

Ms. Goodpasture. Because Mr. Phillips came down there,

Dave. Phillips was the covert action officer and then be was

placed in charge of Cuban operations, but Bob Shaw had

actually been there before, handling the Cuban operations,

and the other memorandum that you referred to was written when

I was trying -- and I said it had several errors in it,

but I remember that Bob. shaw was there working on Cuban

target. I did not know on what date when I wrote this when

Dave Phillips was named as. Chief,

MI. Goldsmith. When Phillips came down, did he replace

Bob Shaw as Chief of Cuban Operations?

Ms. Goodpasture, No, he was there before in another

capacity, then he was named to replace him.

Ms. Coodpasture. They had no operational responsibility.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are you able to evaluate the efficiency

of the Cuban photosurveillance operation?

Ms. Goodpasture. My guess would be that it was just as

efficient when it was operating as the Soviet one.

MI. Goldsmith. With regard to both the photos that were

obtained from the Cuban and the Soviet Embassy and consulates,

what happened to them after they were taken back to the

station and reviewed? Were they stored?

Ms. Goodpasture. They were

stored in the main file,

there, were any of these photographs disposed of?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes. Some of the earlier photographs,

before we began to set up formal files in the late 195Q's were

not used.

During the period that we are talking about to the best

of my knowledge, in 1963, I do not believe any of the photo-

graphs were destroyed as long as MI. Scott was there.

was destroyed in the field.

But the other film, all of the negatives concemed in

this photograph had been sent to headquarters before I began

to look for it last year.

It came up in about 1968 or '69 when certain files

were

sent to headquarters

Mr. Goldsmith. For purposes of clarification, is it

true that, available at headquarters or the Mexico City station

are either the contact prints or the negatives of all of the

pictures that were taken at the Cuban and Soviet Embassy and

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith, Is it also true that available in regard

to these materials are the photoproduction lines that are

maintained?

Ms. Goodpasture. With the one exception that I

mentioned, the others are all aväilable.

MI, Goldsmith.

Are you saying that there was not a

production log with regard to the contact prints?

Ms. Goodpasture, Right.

Mr. Goldsmith, The others were all available from the

Cuban and Soviet Embassy and consulates, is that right?

Ms: Goodpasture. Correct.

MI. Goldsmith. I would like now to turn to the area of

the electronic surveillance operation of the Cuban and

Soviet Embassies and consulates.

How many wiretap operations were in effect with respect

to these embassies and consulates in September and October of

1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. Do you mean how many lines were

operations, you are referring to unilateral, not a lateral?

many projects were there?

Ms. Goodpasture. We had one that we ran independently

and one that was a liaison project.

Mr. Goldsmith, The one that was run independently was

referred to as the unilateral project?

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. With regard to the one that was run

independently, how many taps did you have in operation

with regard to phones at the Soviet Embassy and consulate?

Ms. Goodpasture.

'On the unilateral one?

MI. Goldsnith. Yes.

Ms, Goodpasture. I would have to guess without checking

the files,

MI. Goldsmith. I am just asking for an estimate.

Ms. Goodpasture.. I think - I do not think that there

was any coverage of the Soviets on the unilateral in September

1963. I think all of that was on the liaison. On the Cubans,!

I think there were one or two lines,

MI. Goldsmith. For purposes of clarification, again

we are now talking about the period September-October, 1963.

Turning to the ljaison project, how many taps were in effect

at the Soviet Embassy?

Ms. Goodpasture, I believe there were five.

event, before I get to the question that I just asked you,

how many phones were tapped at the Cuban Embassy and consulate?

Ms. Goodpasture.

The Cuban Embassy, four or five.

MI. Goldsmith. Do you recall which phones? To the best

of your memory, which phones were taped in the Cuban --

Ms • Goodpasture. Four or five.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you recall which ones?

Ms Goodpasture, Which ones?

Not by memory, but I

listed them all a year ago when I reviewed the transcripts,

so there is a list of all the films that were covered at that

time in the records.

Mr. Goldsmith, Did the Mexicans have any unilateral

coverage with regard to the Soviet and Cuban embassies?

Ms. Goodpasture. The project was joint. They had the

same coverage that we had

they, themselves, had a unilateral project? It is possible,

but if they had coverage - which I am sure they probably did

have - but they shared with us the coverage from the joint

project.

MI. Goldsmith. What were your responsibilities with

regard to the wiretapping operations?

Ms. Goodpasture, Legwork and maangement.

Mr, Goldsmith. By management, what do you mean?

Ms. Goodpasture. I recorded all the correspondence,

getting the money, paying the people who did the work, making

sure that the machinery was functioning, picking up all of

the transcripts and supervising most of the people involved

with it, except for the Mexicans.

MI. Goldsmith. In addition to electronic surveillance

ofna wiretapping nature, were there any "bugs" planted in the

Cuban or Soviet Embassy and consulate?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think there were, but I do not have

firsthand knowledge of them. I think that the best person

to give you the best information on that would be the Cuban

case officers, We never put anything in the Soviet Embassy.

Mr. Goldsmith. If you did, would there have been a

transcript made of the conversations that were overheard?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would those transcripts still be on

record at the agency

today?

list of the lines that were covered, both Cuban and Soviet.

lance both of a wiretap and of a bugging nature, did the

Mexico City station have any penetration agents at the Cuban

Embassy?

penetration agents at the soviet Embassy and consulate?

officer for the Cuban operations who would be the only person

who would know about that. It is not in the records.

Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. If you are unable to find that at this

time, perhaps we could pursue it later, It would be best

to continue with the inquiry.

Ms• Goodpasture. Here it is, on page 4.

Mr. Goldsmith. Where specifically on page 4?

Ms, Goodpasture. The files contained the photographs

for the period. 2. May '67 to 30 : of June '67 were in

a folder that had been used, that was marked to hold files

from the period 23 July '63. until 30 November '63.

MI. Goldsmith. Let us see if we can get this straight.

First of all, even though the contact prints would not

be available, the original negatives still would be. That

is correct, is it not?

Ms. Goodpasture. The log for this one base, this one

photographic source, was not available,

MI, Goldsmith.

The original negatives would still be

available?

Ms • Goodpasture:

The negatives are available and the

original photographs are available because they were sent to

Washington, But this file was destroyed, I suppose accidentally.

station?

tape transcribed --

Ms• Goodpasture. In most cases, because the transcribers

with the Spanish texts worked at the same place where the

Yes&

"Mr. Goldsmith. How would that tape recording actually

get to the transcribers, or translaters?

Ms. Goodpasture. The transcribers, or the transcrip-

tions that I picked up, the transcribers were working at the

same place with the Spanish text. If the language were other

than Spanish, it would have to be taken to another location

to be transcribed. The material that was picked up the day

after the date on which it occurred was in the Spanish

language, normally.

Mr. Goldsmith. If the conversation was in Russian,

would it be taken to MI. Boris Tarasoff for translation?

Ms i Goodpasture, That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Routinely, how long did it take MI.

Tarasoff to make the translation?

Ms. Goodpasture. It depended on his backlog, but

generally it was a delay of a day or two.

them, then

the people who had to take the action on them did not

On a wiretap operation, if we got

in advance, we would notify the people taking the photographs

to try to get pictures of then.

That was one way we were tied in, Another way we were

tied in was if we saw where a person had been there at such

and such a time, we would check back to see if there was

way that that person could be identified.

MI. Goldsmith. Similarly, if there was a tape-recording

made of a conversation and from. the conversation it became

apparent that the person at issue was either at one of the

embassies or was

going to go to one of the embassies, it would

be possible, would it not, to go to the photo-production logs

We could determine if there was a

photograph there

and if the photograph appeared to be the same!

person that came up on the wiretap.

Now, there might be someone speaking. English and the only

photograph that we had was someone that was obviously a Latin

whom we knew who did not speak English. We could rule him out!

as being the person who made the call.

place if you knew that someone was either going to the Embassy

or that he was there at a particular time? How would you go

about checking to see if you had a photograph of that person?

and of Soviet or Cuban personnel, is that true?

about the Cubans, but I can say that for sure for the Soviets.

people monitoring the wiretap operation picked up a conversa-

tion that the person regarded to be significant and in that

conversation it became apparent that something was of interest

Would it be standard procedure for that person to call

directly to the photo-surveillance sites?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, because that person did not know

any of the people onducting the photo-surveillance. Now I

think in the case of the unilateral operation which was

also handled unilaterally, wiretap operation, it was also

handled by Tom Keehan. I am not sure if they would contact

the photo people or not, but my people could not contact the

photo people. They would have to come in to me and I would

write a note, give it to Tom, and Tom went out and notified

the photo people.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long would it take for notice to

be given?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, the length of time that it would

take to call somebody and locate them and talk to them,

normally we did not

give them that information on the telephone.

It could be one day, two days, or three days.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would it be possible for

the individual

monitoring the telephone conversation to call his case officer

directly, or to call you directly?

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. To call the case officer directly and

then for the

case officer to immediately contact the photo-

surveillance operations and tell them to take a picture. of

a particular individual?

Ms. Goodpasture. In the case of Tom Keehan's operation,

it would, but in the case of the ones I handled, it would

not. They had to go through the person whom I met outside,

then he got in touch with me and I gave the notice to Tom

and Tom took it to his people.

Mr. Goldsmith. You are drawing a distinction now between

the operations Keehan handled and those which you handled.

What is the distinction you are making? Which operations did

he handle?

Ms. Goodpasture. He handled the unilateral telephone

I would like to clarify this point in terms of the photo

Cuban Embassy and consulate and Soviet Embassy and consulate.

Those materials were all available the last time you knew

with the exception of that particular contact page, and the

photoproduction page pertaining to that contact page, is

that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. You mean available now?

MI. Goldsmith. Right.

Ms, Goodpasture. They are available, yes. That is

correct.

MI. Goldsmith. On the transcripts that were made of

the telephone conversations, would the transcript have an

indication of the telephone line that was being tapped?

Ms • Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. And the location of the telephone? In

other words, the Soviet Embassy, Cuban Embassy?

Ms. Goodpasture. There would be a cryptonym which would

Mr. Goldsmith. What was your response at that point,

if any?

Ms. Goodpasture. A cable was sent to Headquarters

by Mrs; Minell.

MI. Goldsmith. Did you direct Mrs. Minell to send a

cable to headguarters?

Ms. Goodpasture.: No, I did not, because MI. Minell was

my superior. He would have been directed by the Chief - I

say he was my superior. He outranked me in grade.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who sent the cable, Mr. or Mrs. Minell?

Ms: Goodpasture. His wife, but he had his own section

and he had a separate section from the one I was in. We did

not direct each other. We might have suggested it, but he.

took his orders from the Chief of Station.

not:

MI. Goldsmith. The significance of the question is as

follows. Drawing your attention to the third line after the

number 151, it says: "Hello. This is lee Oswald speaking.

I was at your place last Saturday."

Well, October I, 1963 was a Tuesday, the 28th was a

Saturday. I am wondering whether anyone went back to check

onthe transcripts of telephone conversations on that day of

the photo-production materials for that day?

MS. Goodpasture. Theonly indication of the name was

from the telephone transcripts.

MI. Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture, On that day. That was when we first

found out that he was there.

MI. Goldsmith. On October ist, you found out that

Oswald had been at the Russian Embassy the preceding Saturday.

Was any effort made to check your materials from the surveil-

lance operation, the photographic surveillance operation, or

fron the telephonic surveillance operation to

get additional

information on this?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know whether I checked it

immediately or not at this stage. I do know that they were

checked thoroughly after the assassination, In fact, I

think they were checked thoroughly after the information came

back from Washington identifying a Lee Oswald. The files were

checked at that time to find out if we had any record of a

person named Lee or a person named Oswald.

MI. Goldsmith. Fine. Let's stay to this time period

for a moment, however.

Would it have not been

i standard operating procedure if

the transcript refers to a person who appeared at the Embassy

a few days earlier, would it not have been standard operating

procedure for either you or someone else in the Mexico City

station to check your records from that earlier day, September

28th, to see if, in fact, you had a photograph of this person

or another tape recording of his voice?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that it would have been stan

dard practice to have done

a file check on him.

MI. Goldsmith. Is the answer to my question yes?

Ms. Goodpasture. To check the record files to see if

we have a record of that name previously, but to check back

on the transcripts, I did not process the transcripts from

the Soviet Embassy as such. Whether Mr. Minell or Mrs. Minell

went back and reviewed

those again at that time, I do not

know.

of that statement by the person who identifies himself as

have checked?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, I think it would have.

MI. Goldsmith. The photo materials and the wiretap

materials?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right. Also, it would have been done

automatically in the base by the Mexicans.

At that time, was any photograph found of Lee Harvey

Oswald?

Ms. Goodpasture. The only photograph that was located

no, not of oswald. We had no photograph of him.

Mr. Goldsmith. At thatitime, were you able to locate

the earlier tape recording containing a conversation involving

this same individual?

Ms. Goodpasture. I did not, but I do not know if the

Minell's put those taperecordings or not at that time. I

assume that they probably did. I know that they were put

together in November.

would have gone automatically to MI. Minell. The one on

have been called to it, I would not have been doing an

analysis of them.

the two conversations together?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know.

MI. Goldsmith. Did you or the Minell's check the.

photo production materials after seeing this particular

conversation?

Ms. Goodpasture. After seeing the name Lee Oswald, I

think that the photo production materials for that day had

not been received, as: I recall, and a note was given to Tom

Keehan to go out and pick up the film for this period and

bring it in. The transcripts were usually received before

the photographs were.

received, did you or anyone else go to check the photoproduc

tion materials to see if you could idertify the individual?

Do you recall when that happened?

Ms. Goodpasture. This conversation was recorded at

1151 hours on the 28th. The 28th was on a Saturday. We

would have

gotten it probably on Monday, following the 28th.

Then it would have gone out to Mr. Tarasoff who would

have made a trnaslation from the Russian.

photographs and, upon receiving the photographs of production,

you checked these materials, is that correct?

tion from September 28th, did you find a photograph of Lee

Harvey Oswald?

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, Saturday, September 28th, drawing

your attention to that day, would that have been a day when

the Embassy, either the Cuban Embassy or Russian Embassy,

would have been open?

Ms. Goodpasture. Not to the public, I do not think,

but somebody could have

gone there and rung the doorbell and

may have been received by the

guard on duty.

Mr. Goldsmith. Saturday was not really a working day,

is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture.

MI. Goldsmith. I am a bit confused, now. Earlier in

your testimony I recall your indicating that the photo-surveil-

lance operation was coordinated with the working hours of the

embassies. Here we have a situation where the embassies were

not working.

Ms, Goodpasture. I think the photograph was the 27th,

not the 28th. I made a mistake.

MI. Goldsmith. If I may finish, here we have a situation

where the photograph was taken on the 28th. This was a

Saturday If the photograph were taken on the 28th then, in

fact, the photo-surveillance operation was in effect on a

Saturday, which was a non-working day for the Cuban and

soviet embassies, is that correct?

it was not a working day, a Saturday.. But the photo base

houses were places where people lived and if they saw some-

thing that they thought was unusual, they could make a pic-

ture anytime they wanted to and send it in. But they were

normally required to be on duty during the times when the

Embassy had working hours.

Does that explain it?

Mr. Goldsmith. That may explain it in part. I think

we should pursue this just a bit.

The photograph that you found of a person

going to one

of these embassies was taken on September 28th, is that

correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. I would have to look at them to

see. Right now I am a little confused about that myself,

because this man appeared there several times, but we have

copies of those and the dates on them. I do not know if they

are here of not, but I went through the files that we had to

put those dates on.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am afraid that none of the materials

or even September 27th, so I am unable to show you any produc-

tion materials for those two days.

Mr. Goldsmith. You are saying now that you are not

sure whether you found the photograph of September 28th?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not have them here, but I did

get all the photographs of that man, together with the dates

on them, which I think you have. When I was looking here on

this 28th transcript, I said 28th and what. I was thinking

was that when we checked the photographs for the days around

the time of the call, we found the photograph, but I do not

know what day it was now, right off the top of my head.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you find a photograph of just one

person who appeared to be North American in appearance?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. How many days' photogräphic surveillance

coverage did you review?

Ms. Goodpasture.

How many days?

Mr. Goldsmith, Right.

Ms. -Goodpasture.

They were the same days that were

mentioned in the transcripts.

Mr. Goldsmith. Four or five days?

Would that be a

fair estimate?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

MI. Goldsmith. I notice Mr. Shaw's name on this, on

the top of the page, page 2. Why would his name be up there?

Ms. Goodpasture. His name would be on here because the

telephone call came fron a woman from the Cuban Embassy, but

he was responsible for the Cuban Embassy coverage.

MI. Goldsmith. Why did this particular document

= go to

Shaw rather than to Dave Phillips?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Because Shaw had handled most of the

routine work and I think he was the one who read all of the

transcripts. But to be perfectly exact about it, I am not

too sure. I suppose Dave Phillips did not have time to read

the transcripts and Shaw was the one who reviewed them.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it possible in fact that the photo-

graph that you found was thephotograph that was taken on

September 28th, 1963?

Ms, Goodpasture. To answer your question we would have

to check the log because the log has the date of the photo-

graphs and a copy of the photograph attached to it.

Mr. Goldsmith. In any event, with regard to the conver-

sation of October Ist and the conversation of October 28tk,

these came to your attention right around that time period as

opposed to some time

after the assassination, is that correct?!

Ms. Goodpasture. The conversations that had the name

in it, Lee Oswald, came to my attention right after the

conversation occurred.

MI, Goldsmith, The conversation of the 28th, when did

that first come to your attention?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not recall seeing it until after

the assassination.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, was your testimony éarlier to

the effect that upon receiving the conversation reflected on

page 2, the September 28th, 1963 conversation, and after it

was made, to locate a picture of the person who was

going to

the Russian Embassy, You did indicate that, did you not?

Ms. Goodpasture, Well, this conversation may have

been tied into the Oswald conversation by the Russian trans-

criber because he did both of them about the same time.

There was only one day's difference. It is logical

to assume that he would have recognized the voice, and we

probably had both transcripts at the same time looking for a

man when we were examining the photographs.

Mr. Goldsmith. This, in all likelihood, would have

been brought to your attention,

Ms Goodpasture. When?

Mr. Goldsmith,

Shortly after September 28th?

Ms, Goodpasture. Right. If it was with the lee Oswald

but Mr. Minell and I looked at them after, his wife and I

examined them after the Oswald name first appeared.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, this conversation did come

to your attention well before the assassination?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there anything, in your opinion,

unusual about. Oswald's being at the Cuban Embassy on a

Saturday?

Ms. Goodpasture.. I do not think that the Cuban Embassy

connection was tied in until afterwards, I do not know.

There were two calls on the 27th to the Cuban Embassy•

MI. Goldsmith. I will rephrases the question. It is

apparently that, on September 28, 1963, Oswald, according to

this conversation, was at the Cuban Embassy. That is where

the conversation was made from, so at that day he was at the

Cuban Embassy. You indicated that that would not have been

a working day for the Cuban Embassy, is that correct?

MS. Goodpasture, The photo-surveillance, you mean?

Mr. Goldsmith,

Saturday would not have been a working

day for the Cuban Embassy.

Ms. Goodpasture:

That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was there anything unusual about.

Oswald's being at the Cuban Embassy on a day that was not a

working day?

Ms, Goodpasture. No, because foreigners were

both places and ringing the door bell and the gate-keeper

frequently let them in on days other than working days.

Mr. Goldsmith. If it is true that foreigners were

frequently visiting the embassies on days other than working

days, then why was the photo-surveillance operation confined

to working days?

Ms. Goodpasture. Because the people could not work

around the clock. They had to have some time off. One of

the photographers, as I recall, was apart-time student, or

something, but it was not possible to have that thing going

all the tine.

I think later maybe it set up a mechanical type surveil

lance that ran continuously.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, there were three different

camera sites?

Ms, Goodpasture. They did not all hit the same place.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it not possible, despite staffing

problems, that on Saturday and Sunday at least one of the

photo sites could have been maintained?

Ms. Goodpasture, It could have been possible if we had

been working, if our photographers had been Anerican citizens

and staff agents, but we were working with Mexicans and not

many of them worked on Sundays, normally.

That was their day

off.

MI. Goldsmith, How about Saturdays?

There were three different photo

I do not know whether someone else made one or not, There is

a transcript, a cable here, in which the transcriber of the

Ms. Goodpasture,

We did an analysis of the conversa-

Mr. Goldsmith. He visited the embassy and consulate

approximately five times? And eyen though he visited these

places five times, the station's photosurveillance operations

never took a picture of him, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Ms. Goldsmith. Is there any reason that you can give

as to why the photosurveillance operation, having had five

shots at Mr. Oswald, nevertheless

Ms, Goodpasture. I could speculate, but I just assume

that he went there later in the day than they were still

wroking.

Mr. Goldsmith. In effect, they would have had an

opportunity to get a picture of Mr. Oswald, or the person who

said he was Mr. Oswald, when he went into the embassy and

when he went out of there, so really, there were ten oppor

tunities to take pictures of MI. Oswald and yet there was no

picture taken of him,

Mr. Goldsmith. Afteri the assassination, was he satis

fied with the performance of the photo-surveillance operation

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, we still did not have the

exact times that Oswald went to these places, the inferences

that he used and we could not prove that one of our people

was sitting there, making photographs, and missed him.

Human error if the photograph station was working that

he was missed.

Mr: Golâsmith. Without intending to sound argumenta.

tive in any way, I would raise the question that needs to be

raised, which is how efficient is the photosurveillance

operation that has ten opportunities to take a picture of

someone and apparently fails in each instance?

Ms, Goodpasture. I think the people that were handling

the photobase at that time sat down and tried to figure out

why it happened. As I recall, they did not think it was

terribly unusual.

I think the Cubans said their machinery was not

functioning, and I think for the Soviets it was atra time

when they were not working, but I an not sure.

We did not know, because at the time

that Oswald had already left there. It was not until after

the assassination that we had the dates of Oswald's

departure from Mexico.

Up until the assassination time and after the assassina

was unidentified could have been Oswald if he had been still

there the 15th.

C, page 2, We have reviewed this particular document before.

Do you have it before you?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsnith. We reviewed this document earlier today,

have we not?

Ms. Goodpasture: Right,

MI. Goldsmith. Drawing your attention to the first

paragraph, it indicates, does it not, on 1 October 63 an

American male speaking broken Russian made contact with the

Soviet embassy, Is that correct?

Ms Goodpasture.' That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. In the second paragraph, it referscto a

photograph, does it not?

Ms, Goodpasture. Yes:

Mr, Goldsmith. Does the second paragraph refer to the

photograph I have just given you?

Ms: Goodpasture. Right..

Mr. Goldsmith. Does it refer to the photograph I have

just given you a copy of?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes. It refers to a photograph of

this man. I am not sure that these photographs were made.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, nine or ten photographs may

have been taken of this particular man? We do not know that

this was the particular one taken on that day, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

MI. Goldsmith.. Why was the reference made in this

cable to a photograph taken on October 1, 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. It should have been October 2.

That

October lst was the wrong date. I showed you the log yesterday

-to

show you how that error occurred.

Mr. Goldsmith. At this point, let us look at the 109.

In order to do that, you will have to look at stack A. It

is A-4. I believe it is marked Stack A-4. Do you have that

before you? Do you have the log before you?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Looking at the log, can you now

explain to the Committee why the cable referred to a photo-

graph taken on October Ist when actually it was taken on

another day?

Ms. Goodpasture. If you look at the log here you see

at the top - it was just an oversight on the part of the

person who was writing that cable. It looks as though the

date is 1 October, but if you read it very closely you see

there are only two frames that were shot on 1 October and

2 October, it starts up with frame number 3, et cetera, et

cetera, and there the shots occur. That is the only explana-

tion I can give.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is your explanation that whomever

referred to the log simply looked at the date at the top of

the page, the date being October Ist, and did not see any

reference tocthe date October 2nd?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Getting back to the cable, what is the

date of the cable?

Ms. Goodpasture. 8 October.

Mr. Goldsmith.

If the photograph was taken on October

2nd, what was the reason for the delay in transmitting this

information to headquarters?

Ms. Goodpasture. It took about a week for processing,

generally. Two or three days. Someone had to go out and

get it and bring it in.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated earlier in your testimony

that the photograph you found was never linked to Oswald, Yet

paragraph 2 of this cable is tied in to paragraph 1 which

specifically refers to an American male who said his name

was Oswald.

Does that not indicate that, in fact, the link was made?

Ms. Goodpasture. As I said, the link was made earlier.

It did not relate to Oswald. That was hindsight. At the time

Mr. Goldsmith. I believe that my question earlier was

clear. If you have a problem understanding my questions,

Ms. Goodpasture. It was realized that it was not

cation of Oswald that they had a file trace on in the Washing-

ton cable was different from the one that the description of

the man who was in the photograph.

Mr. Dodd. You reached that conclusion on what day;

with the 10 October 163 cable, what day would you have

was controversy there over whether this man could have been

Mr. Dodd. Counsel, why do you not proceed?

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you describe the controversy that

you are referring to, Miss Goodpasture, over whether this

man was Oswald?

Ms. Goodpasture.. I felt that

it was not oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. When did you feel this? At the time

that the cable was sent?

Ms. Goodpasture. As soon as we got the description,

because I did not think this man, this photograph, could

possibly be the same man that was described here.

MI. Goldsmith. What actions were taken at that point

to clarify the situation?

Ms. Goodpasture. I had an argument, I think, with the

Deputy Chief of Station, Mr. Scott, over it. He said, oh,

that may be incorrect and so forth. But there was quibbling

over it:

Mr. Goldsmith. Going back to the cable that appears

on page 2, I am still not sure that I understand why the

photo was sent to headquarters. What indication did you

have that Oswald had been to the Cuban or Russian Embassy

October lst of 2nd of 1963?

The transcripts that we reviewed earlier gave no indica-

tion that he was going to be there on that day.

going to be at the Russian or Cuban Embassy on October Ist

Mr. Goldsmith.: I understand that but, however, at the

entering the Soviet Embassy on October Ist and now we find

that it really was October 2nd. And apparently you checked

the production logs for October Ist and 2nd.

My question is; since the transcripts gave no indication

that Oswald had been at the Embassy on October Ist or 2nd

why was this picture connected to Oswald? You have no inde-

pendent information that. Oswald had been to the Embassy on

October lst or 2nd?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is true, but we could not tell

from this conversation on the Ist that he did not go there.

We also could not tell from our transcripts that he had left

the area and that there was a possibility that he had gone

MI. Goldsmith. You checked the photosurveillance

materials for approximately a four or five day period, is that

correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, I think it is.

Mr. Goldsmith. During that four or five day period

Oswald was the only -- not Oswald. This man was the only

non-Latin appearing man whose photograph you found, is that

correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that it was the only linon-

Latin appearing person's photograph that we found that we

could not identify as somebody else. A lot of the people

who went to the Soviet Embassy all the time, we came to know

who they were. After they had been identified, they made

frequent visits there.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to refer your attention

now to page 5.

MI. Preyer. Counsel, may I speak to you for a moment?

Mr. Dodd. Miss Goodpasture, I am checking on the time

Mr. "Goldsmith.. For purposes of clarification, the

you thought was Oswald, was his appearance at the Embassy

considered to be unusual or of any significant interest?

Ms. Goodpasture. Would you ask that question again?

I am not sure I understood.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was the fact that Oswald or the person

whom you identified as Oswald appeared at the embassies when

he did, was that considered unusual?

Ms. Goodpasture. No. Frequently there were callers,

people who were American citizens, long distance calls, local

Ms. Goodpasture. I was in Mexico so I would not really

know why he did it at headquarters.

MI. Goldsmith. I understand.

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Karamessinas' position was a

relatively high one in the CIA hierarchy, is that correct?

Ms . Goodpasture.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. This was a matter that was not considered

to be of particular significance, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. It was not significant to us at the

time that - before we got the name trace. It may have been

considered significant here in Washington because it was.

possibly because he was a former defector.

MI. Goldsmith. I see. The Washington authorities may

have regarded this as significant and upon receipt of this

cable in Mexico City station, I believe you indicated before

that Mx. Tarasoff apparently made a voice comparison of the

taped conversations Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. If headquarters considered this matter

to be significant, would they have been apprised of the

results of this voice comparison?

Ma. Goldsmith.

As a matter of routine procedure?

Ms. Goodpasture. The voice comparison only indicated

that he called the Soviet embassy and the Cuban embassy.

We

had his name, a name, Oswald, in the traffic to the soviet

embassy to start off with, and the only thing the voice

comparison did, it tied in that name, but we had no way of

identifying our caller exactly with the subject of this

trace.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are you saying, then, that the fact

that Oswald, the fact that you were able to, by voice compari-

son, establish that he had been to the Cuban Embassy and the

Soviet Embassy was not significant?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is what we said in the note.

In the transcripts, he called the Soviet embassy from the

Cuban embassy, a man, and that voice by the Russian trans-

criber was identified as the same voice as the person who

said his name was Lee Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith: I understand that. But headquarters

was never apprised of that voice comparison?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think they were in a cable.

MI. Goldsmith. Prior to the assassination?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, I do not think they were prior

to the assassination.

Mr. Goldsmith. Apparently the fact that the Lee Harvey

Oswald was considered significantly significant for Mr.

Karamessinas to be the releasing officer of the cable to the

Mexican station and a voice comparison is made for the purpose

of determining essentially whether Oswald had been to both

the Cuban and the Soviet Embassy. According to your testi-

mony, the results of that voice comparison were that in fact

it was the same person.

Are you saying that the fact that Oswald had been to

both the Cuban and the Russian embassy was not considered

sufficiently important to notify headquarters prior to the

assassination?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, because at that stage, we had no

way of proving that the man who made that call in Mexico was

the same man that this trace was about.:

MI. Goldsmith. The cable from headquarters gives back-

ground information on MI. Oswald, does it not?

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

We assumed that it probably was.

Mr. Goldsmith. Right.

After receiving the cable, a voice comparison is made.

It is determined that the same person was talking on each

tape and there is no follow-up to headquarters, even though

headquarters clearly considered this to be significant?

Ms. Goodpasture. The follow-up was made by disseminat-

ing this information from the traces locally and trying to

the follow up was made. We thought that he may still be in

Mr. Goldsmith. The point is, however, that upon the

making of a voice comparison, if, in fact, that was done,

that information was not communicated to anyone.

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not know if it was or not.

You would have to check the file completely, the cable

traffic, to

To the best of my knowledge, it

was not until after the assassination.

Mr. Goldsmith. If it were not, would that be unusual?

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

Mr: Goldsmith. Despite the fact that this was considered

something of significance by headguarters?

Ms. Goodpasture. Headquarters - no, because they

could not have done anything with the voice comparison.

Mr. Goldsmith. Perhaps they could not have done any

thing with the voice comparison, but they may have considered

it to be even more serious had they been informed that not

only had Oswald been to the Soviet. Embassy but he also had

been to the Cuban Embassy®

call from the Soviet Embassy came from the Cuban Embassy.

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

MI. Goldsmith. In fact, headquarters did not know that

he had also been to the Cuban Embassy:

Ms. Goodpasture. At that point, no.

MI, Goldsmith. At least, according to your recollec-

tion, it was not until after the assassination that head-

quarters was informed of that fact.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is probably right.

Mr. Goldsmith, Have you ever spoken to Mr. Karasmes-

about this matter?

not have the names of the people on then.

Mr. Goldsmith. There are other indications on the

cable as well that headquarters regarded this incident to be

significant, is that not true? The cable also contains other

indications that indicated that headquarters regarded this

matter to be significant, is that not true?

For example, in paragraph 4 -- I am referring now to

page 5 of Stack C, paragraph 4 -- it says, "Station should

pass info RIF(1) and it

gives cryptonyms of various govern-

mental agencies. Certainly that is an indication that

headquarters regarded this as significant.

Ms. Goodpasture. That information was taken immediately

and all efforts were made to locate the man in Mexico, think-

ing that he was still there, but this cable did not tell us

that he had come back to the states.

MI. Goldsmith. I understand. The only point I am

making here, this is a spearate indication that headquarters

regarded this to be a matter of significance, the fact that

they told you to pass along information to other people.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

questions. I would ask counsel to continue with those

questions.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you.

One question that was out of the line of my inquiry

that I was making prior to the recess, at the time that

the Oswald reco-ding was obtained, did you or anyone else

go to Boris Tarasoff and indicate to him that this was a matter

of special importance and needed to be transcribed immedi

ately?

Ms. Goodpasture. The first tape with his voice on it,

I cannot remember whether or not I took that to Herb Minell

or whether the outside agent took it to Tarasoff, but it was

taken to Tarasoff at the same time that it came in from the

base,

MI. Goldsmith. Was Tarasoff given special instructions

that this particular recording was of unusual importance?

MS. Goodpasture. I am quite sure that he was asked

it immediately?

Ms . Coodpasture.e

So they could find out whether there

was any information there under the name Lee Oswald. That

was the only transcription that he did except for a short

one from the Cuban Embassy

staff.

MI. Goldsmith. The first conversation that came in

involving Oswald apparently came in on september 27, that

he was not identified by name in that conversation.

Ms, Goodpasture. No, that is right.

'Mr. Goldsmith. Was that tape taken to Tarasoff?

Is

that the one that he was asked to transcribe immediately?

Ms. Goodpasture. The one that he was asked to transcribe

immediately was the one that had the name on it. The one

that was unidentified, it would also have been taken to him

as soon as it came off of the machine, and he would have been

asked to transcribe it as soon as he could.

Mr. Goldsmith, I am not sure I follow you why there

was a need

• to transcribe it immediately.

Ms. Goodpasture.

Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith, Why was there a need to have him

transcribe it immediately?

Ms • Goodpasture.

The Lee Oswald one?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms. Goodpasture. The conversation was in Russian, or

broken Russian, but it was in a language that the monitors

inside could not understand. They could not tell if the

man had a telephone number there or if he had an address

or if he gave more information in the Russian language than

his name.

The only thing they got was his name, which I believe

was in English.

MX. Goldsmith. Even so, why could they not have waited

for the ordinary lag time to ensure prior to the transcrip

tion of the recording?

Ms. Goodpasture. Wait a minute, We are talking about

two different things. The reason that he would have been

asked, Tarasoff would have been asked, to transcribe it

immediately would have been because we had a name connected

with it.

Most of Tarasoff's transcription work was trans-

cribing Russian to English, but the conversations were with

persons. who were in the Embassy, Soviet personnel, and in

that process he built up a backlog.

So if something came in that was not a Soviet or

something other than the people who we knew there talking,

he would have been asked to do that immediately before the

chit-chat. conversation translations of people who were

living in the Embassy.

Now do you understand what I am talking about?

MI. Goldsmith. I think your explanation is responsive.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like, at this point, to refer

to page 6. of the documents contained in Stack C.. In this

regard, can you identify this particular document?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, it is a cover sheet that would

go over a cable in the Mexico station files..

Mr. Goldsmith. Is this the cover sheet that went with

the cable that was received from headquarters which gave the

correct description of

Oswald?

Ms. Goodpasture.

Probably on the lith of october.

That is the date stamped here.

MI. Goldsmith. In fact, number i-

-i: Ms, Goodpasture. No, that is not right. The date.

is stamped there with the date of the message. The day it

was received was 12 October which was the day that is

beside Scott's name.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, the routing slip pertains

to cable number 74830.

Washington that gave the description of Oswald, is that

correct?

individual that is maintained at headquarters?

Ms. Goodpasture. It is not any different at all It

is the same type of file.

Ms. Goodpasture. Not always.. It should be, but some-

times formal communication was

sent to headguarters that was

written from several notes.

The formal communication, such

as the cable, would be in the headquarters files, but if some-

one had taken the information down from the conversation on a

table napkin, or something, and had not written a formal

memorandum for the file, the raw data would not be in the

headquarters file.

Mr. Goldsmith How long would it take to open aP file

locally?

Ms. Goodpasture. Depending on the workload, it should

not take longer than a day to take a file folder out of the

cabinet and put the material in and put a label on it.

MI. Goldsmith. Is it likely that Oswald's P file

was open shortly after October 12, 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. I would assume so.

Mx. Goldsmith. Examining the statement in cursive

by Mr. Scott, it says, "Please set up P file on Lee Henry

Oswald and put all data that we have into it."" "All" is

underscored.

Do you have any explanation for why Mr. Scott would

have bothered to underscore "all"?

Ms. Goodpasture. He always did that.

you always had the feeling that your files were never

complete enough.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. As a matter of routine, who would review

the cable upon receiving it in Mexico City?

Ms. Goodpasture. The first person to get all cable

traffic was the Chief of Station and the second person to get

it was Alan White. The third person to get it was usually

the person to whom it was routed to, that. Mr. Scott wanted

to see it first.

Mr. Goldsmith. On page 7, This appears to be MI.

Scott's handwriting in dark, the dark lines, and the hand-

writing.

Ms, Goodpasture: Winn Scott's.

Mr. Goldsmith. Drawing your attention to the arrow

title on it, also known as lee Henry Oswald. That is what

the "sic" designates, that it could be two names.

MI. Goldsmith. If that were the case, would not the

appropriate way to indicate that be by writing down "aka"

instead of "sici."

Ms. Goodpasture.

"Aka" was also used.

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, my impression is that the

term "sic! is used as a matter of routine in the English

language to designate that. the item that is referred to is

erroneous.:

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not think he meant it in those

terms. "I think he wanted both names to be on the file..

is another world now and there is no way of finding out.

Mr. Goldsmith Understood.

In fact, the "sic" points right to the lenry and in

fact Oswald's real name was Harvey not Henry, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did Winn Scott know that Oswald's middle

name was Harvey and not Henry?

Ms. Goodpasture. Not to my knowledge. We had no record

of it at the Mexico station, We had no trace on anyone by

oswald.

MI. Goldsmith, That is exactly right. It is an impor-

tant question.

Ms, Goodpasture. Right.

That is why, I think, that he must have wanted it so

that the file would show lee Oswald and also Lee Henry

Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. If the Committee wanted to verify whether

it was standard procedure for Mr. Scott to indicate that a file

should be opened under more than one name, for him to indi-

cate. that by writing down the word "sic;" I presume that all

we would have to do is to review cable traffic of routing

sheets to see if that was a matter of routine, he used that

terminology, "sic" is that not correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. You could if you wanted.

MI. Goldsmith. If, in fact, it turned out that as a

matter of routine he did not use the terminology "sic" to

refer to the opening of a file under more than one name, that

might indicate, would it not, that scott was aware of oswald's

true middle name?

Ms. Goodpasture. I would not go so far as to suggest

that. You could assume that you thought that he knew, but

if he knew it, we certainly had no record of it to my knowledge

at the Mexico station.

knowledge that the individual that made that notation there,

sic, as a result of your personal knowledge of this individual,

he used those words interchangeably all the time, even though

you know that those two words have different meanings, Or

those symbols have different meanings?

Ms, Goodpasture.

That is not what I mean to say:

some

sort

of special knowledge that this individual used those symbols

interchangeably.

Ms. Goodpasture. In the context of the way the name

Lee Oswald came to our attention the first time, it was in

such a way that we could not tell the man was saying his

name was Lee and Oswald, or whether his name was Lee Oswald.

MI. Dodd. What notation was made in that reference

in the cable traffic when the transcripts -- what notation is

in parentheses?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Dodd. What notation was in parentheses in the

transcripts of the telephone conversations?: Does the word

phonetic, does that strike a bell in parentheses, phonetic?

Ms. Goodpasture. Phonetic, Lee Oswald.

When the transcript was first brought to me, the man

outside, as I recall, said they do not know if this man is

Lee or whether it is Oswald.

Mr. Dodd. If they indicated they did not understand,

what did they put in parentheses?

Ms. Goodpasture. Before the action was taken on the

transcript, was taken to the transcriber who prepared an

English translation and on the basis of his English trans-

lation they felt that, the person who prepared the cable

felt, that the name was Lee Oswald.

MI. Dodd. Did they not put phonetic?

Ms . Goodpasture.

They put phonetic.

Mr. Dodd. They did not put sic?

Ms. Goodpasture. I did not make myself clear. What

I meant when I answered his question, I thought, I think,

that this refers to the fact that the first lee Oswald that

we had was garbled.

Mr. Goldsmith. Where was that?

What are you talking

about, on the transcripts or the conversation?

Ms, Goodpasture. From the transcripts, yes, sir.

And we had never seen the name printed and that I thought what

he meant that this Lee Henry Oswald file should have in it

all the information that we had on the man with the name,

the garbled name, the Lee Oswald that had come up in the

transcripts.

That was just my interpretation. I do not know, to

answer the question truthfully.

MI.. Dodd.

Let us go back a little bit and, counsel,

I will ask you to assist me on this, but in all of the trans

cripts, was there any middle name or middle initial mentioned?

I do not recall seeing any.

MI. Goldsmith. No, there was not.

MI. Dodd. That does not explain the letter or the

language "sic" by Henry, because they had never been any

reference to a Henry or a Harvey•

Ms. Goodpasture. That Henry, I think that was the

headquarters mistake. This cable originated in headquarters

that we are looking at and this is a copy of it as it was

received in Mexico.

The first time that we received the name on Oswald and

the traces it was Lee Henry, and it was later that it became

Lee Harvey:

MI. Dodd. We are getting away from my point. If it

were a question about using a different name as you have

properly described Aka, also known as, is the proper letter

to use in that kind of situation where a sic, as you have

properly defined it, describes an entirely different

situation.

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Dodd.. My next question is, how well did you know

MI. Scott? Didyou know him well?

Ms Goodpasture. Let me answer it this way. I do not

reasonable doubt what he meant here by this term.

MI. Dodd. Were you familiar with his annotations on

other cable traffic?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, yes, I think I probably was

more familiar than anybody else who was down there at that

time because I was down there longer.

Mr.. Dodd. Did you ever notice that he used these

symbols interchangeably in other cable traffic?

Ms. Goodpasture:

Yes, I think he would use it. I have

seen him write sic in for a garbled name by the side of it.

One garbled version put in for the information on a file

traced with another name.

MI. Dodd. Thank you. I turn questioning over to

counsel.

Mr. Göldsmith, Referring to page 6 of Stack C, Scott

indicates that a P file should be opened on Lee Henry Oswald

does he not?

Ms, Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith, He does not indicate that a file should

be opened under Lee Oswald and Lee Henry Oswald, does he?

In other words, he does not indicate the file should

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. So really there is no basis at all for

thinking that the term "sic" indidates what Scott had in mind

was an "aka" is there? There is no basis for reaching that

conclusion, is there?

Ms. Goodpasture. Would you repeat that again?

MI, Goldsmith. Certainly:

It is apparent from the routing indication on page 6

that Scott wanted the file opened on Lee Henry Oswald.

Ms • Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. He gave no indication on the routing

slip that he wanted the file open up under the name Lee Henry

Oswald aka Lee Oswald. There is no indication that

the file

was to be opened up under two names. In light of that, there

is really no basis, is there, for concluding that the use of

the phrase sic on page 7 refers to the term aka?

Ms: Goodpasture. My interpretation that the use of

the word sic was for the Lee Oswald, the first name in there

on page 7 and that all of the information about that name

that we did not know the full name on would go into the other

file,

MI. Goldsmith. He concluded that it was the same

person on both tapes, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like you to refer now to page

21 in stack C, page 21.

Ms. Goodpasture.:

MI. Goldsmith.

We will make that page 22. Can you

identify this: document?

Yes, This is a copy of a cable that

was sent from headquarters to Washington.

cable?

this cable?

MI. Goldsmith. What is your understanding of the term

"authenticating officer"? What does that term mean?

Ms. Goodpasture. Someone who has the authority to sign

a cable, to release it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would an authenticating officer simply

sign a cable and release it, or is there anything that he

would do before signing?

Ms. Goodpasture. The releasing officer was a superior

officer

Mr, Goldsmith. It would be the responsibility of the

authenticating officer, would it not, to verify the accuracy

of the contents of the cable?

Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, that would be his responsibility.

MI. Goldsmith. Drawing your attention to the bottom of

page 22, please read the second paragraph.

(Pause)

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. Specifically, this seems to indicate

that the station is unable to compare the voice of the first

tape, which was erased pror to the receipt of the second call?

Is: that true? Is that what the document indicates?

Ms. Goodpasture. Right.

MI. Goldsmith. Do you have any explanation for the

inconsistency between this document and your earlier testimony

that there was a voice comparison made?

Ms •

Goodpasture. The only explanation that I can make

is that the Soviet transcriber made it on the basis of not

listening to the two tapes again over, but on his memory of

yes, that is the same man that I listened to and transcribed

the tape fron the Soviet Embassy, the man who called himself

Lee Oswald®

Mr. Dodd, Counsel, I do not want to interrupt you.

Mrs. Goodpasture, you worked a long time in that Embassy,

yOu

are very familiar with technical terms and terminology

that are used.

Now, when you are doing a voice comparison and what

all of that means, a voice comparison, that is a rather

technical description of

something, and you just stated a

minute ago that a voice comparison was made. I would assume

by that that you are telling this committee - and we are

grateful that you are here, we appreciate your testimony.

We have a very difficult job in front of us. We are trying

to get to the bottom of this whole story, and you are making

it difficult

I do not like to have to tell you that, but you are. You

are using the term "voice comparison" and you are indicating

to this committee that there was analysis made of a person's

voice, not the merory of a transcriber. It is a technical job.

It is not something that you leave to somebody who is merely

a translator, and you just finished telling us that a voice

comparison was made.

Your own memorandum there on page 21

says that, in fact, one could not have been made.

What is the truth here?

Ms, Goodpasture. I think that what happened was that

the voice comparison, by taking the two tapes, I think the

tape had been destroyed

Based on my memory now

MI. Dodd. What you just said a minute ago

Ms. Goodpasture, To tell you the truth, I do not

remember.

MI. Dodd. What you just said a moment ago is not

true, then, that there is not a voice comparison?

Ms. Goodpasture. What I said a moment ago was based on

a note that had been made in the files, that the transcriber

hadilcompared the voices, and this note was written 14 years

ago!

23

24

23

MI. Dodd. Based upon your working knowledge of the

terminology of voice comparison, does that normally involve

listening to two tapes with someone who is technically trained

to make a determination as to whether or not the voices on two

different tapes are one and the same person?

Ms. Goodpasture. The way it was used, to me it would

also mean that a person who had listened to two tapes at

different times and said that they were the same, that it

would be a comparison by him.

Mr. Dodd. That was considered a bona fide voice

comparison?

Ms. Goodpasture. Not in the technical sense that you

are referring to. You are correct,

Mr. Dodd. Counsel, you may proceed. I am awfully

confused about your statement.

Ms. Goodpasture. I apologize for that. It is a con-

fusion tome of so much material at one time, going over it

and the details of it. But I honestly do not remember being

present when those tapes were listened to, or a conversation

relating to it. It was this material that came up in the

files.

You understand, when you are talking out

voices being compares, you are comparing a tape of someone

speaking.

Ms, Goodpasture. Right.

Mr. Dodd,. You cannot make a comparison based on a

transcript or someone's memory of a tape that had been

destroyed, by your own testimony.

Ms. Goodpasture. A better way to explain it would have

been, probably, if this occurred, would have been to have

MI. Dodd. Picking up, Mrs. Goodpasture, where we left

off at the time of the last break and you have had a few

minutes to think over my question, I do not want you to think

for one second that I am particularly being tough in any

way. It is just that these are very, very important ques

tions and I would like you to answer you as honestly and as

candidly as you can as to when you think you made that

notation.

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that I made the notation within

about a week of ten days after the date of the newspaper

article, because this was a Washington article and it would

have been sent to us in Mexico

Mr. Dodd. 1964?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think it would have been some time

towards the end of October, 1964.

Mr. Dodd. Did I understand you correctly to respond

to counsel's question, turning to page 22, that you were

the releasing officer, authenticating officer - which was it

on that memo? Did I hear your response to that correctly?

Mr. Goldsmith. Were you the authenticating officer of

this memo?

Ms • Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Dodd. You were the authenticating officer for

that memo?

MI. Dodd. Cable dated 23 November 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, sir.

Mr. Dodd. I read to you again paragraph 2. "In view

Oswald Soviet Union. In fact, he claimed on 1 October, the

envoy" — whatever that is - "to have visited the Soviet

Embassy 28 September:

Subject paragraph 1 probably Oswald.

Station unable to compare

voice as first tape erased prior

second call."

That is November, 1963 and in October of '64, "Voices

compared by Findglass." Which is true?

Ms. Goodpasture. The notation was made in 1964 on this

newspaper article. I think that I was referring to the trans-

criber, Mr. Tarasoff's, identifying the man as having made

both calls in listening to the tapes.

MI. Dodd. Why did you not make that same observation

on 23 November 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. That was a mistake I made that I should

not have made. I should have stated it exactly as it occurred

so we would not be in doubt now. But I do not know.

Mr. Dodd. So the statement made on 23 November '63 is

inaccurate?

Ms. Goodpasture. To the best of my knowledge, it is..

I am sure I could not locate the tapes, or I would not have.

put that in the cable.

Mr. Dodd. Thank you.

Counsel, You may proceed.

MI. Goldsmith. Thank you.

In this regard, I would like to refer to Stack B, the

document, page 1 in Stack B, which is the transcript ofithe

conversation in reference to Oswald. That is Stack B, page

1.: This is a transcription of a conversation involving

Oswald that took place on 1 October 1963.

By the line which immediately follows the number 151

in brackets it says "the same person who phoned a day or so

ago and spoke in broken Russian."

Viewing this language in connection with page 67 of

Stack C, that is the newspaper article that we were just

referring to -

Ms. Goodpasture. 67.

Mr. Goldsmith. Page 67, the newspaper article that

we were just referring to. I direct your attention to the

last paragraph of that article, the one that is marked off,

specifically the one that is adjacent to your marginal nota-

tion.

Would you please read that?

Ms. Goodpasture: Yes:

Mr. Goldsmith. Might it not be said that, viewing these

two items together, the language in this paragraph and the

statement in brackets, the same person who phoned a day or so

ago and spoke broken Russian, that it was apparent that Oswald,

in fact, had visited the Cuban Embassy earlier?

Ms Goodpasture..

Would you repeat that again, please?

MI. Goldsmith. Viewing these two documents together,

the last paragraph of the article, the language in brackets,

it says, "The same person

i who phoned a day or so ago and

spoke in broken Russian."

Does it not become apparent that Oswald, in fact, had

visited the Cuban Embassy earlier?

I admit that is not a direct

inference that can be

drawn, but if you follow the transcripts, if you

go back to

the preceding Saturday and you review the transcripts from

that day, it becomes apparent that Oswald had been at the Cuban

Embassy on Saturday. The point that I am getting at is that

independent of these documents here, it would seem that a

voice comparison, in fact, would have to have been made.

Ms. Goodpasture.

I think that he recognized the voice

from having listened to a tape of the Cuban Embassy that had

Russian on it but did not have a name, instead of just

listening to two tapes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Going back to page 22 of Stack C it

says, "station unable to compare voice as first tape erased

prior receipt second call."

Does that suggest to you at at the time that this cable

was sent the second tape wasstill in existence? It says

one tape was destroyed or erased; the second one was not.

Mr. Goldsmith. Right. The first tape, according to

this cable, had been erased. What about the second tape?

Ms. Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith. What about the second tape? There are

two tapes we are talking about.

Ms. Goodpasture. YOu said what about the second tape.

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, that is what I said.

This seems to suggest that while the first tape had

been erased, the second tape has not been erased.

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This cable is dated November 23, 1963.

What happened to the tape that was in existence on November

23, 1963?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not think that it was still in

existence in November, 1963 but I think that it still was in

existence when the tape from the second call cane back to us.

But the first one, we discovered, had been erased.

Mt. Goldsmith.

This says, "station unable to compare

voice as first tape erased prior receipt second call." Why

does. not the cable say instead -

Ms. Goodpasture. They both were erased. I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. I recalled earlier that your testimony

was that you looked for the tapes and that you could not

find the first one. That also suggests that this second one,

in fact, was found.

Was the

second tape found?

Ms. Goodpasture. Would you repeat that, please?

Mr. Goldsmith. Your testinony earlier was that you

looked for the tapes but you were unable to find the first

tape.

You did not say that you were unable to find either

tape •

You said that you were unable to find the first tape.

That, again, suggests that the second tape was found.

Ms. Goodpasture. No, I do not think I was able to find

any of the tapes that had Lee Oswald's calls on them. I found

the original transcripts, but

I could not find the tapes that

had those calls.

Mr. Goldsmith. The calls in question came in between

September 27 and October 1, 1963, is that corréct?

Ms. Goodpasture. The first call?

Mr, Goldsmith. Yes.

Ms • Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. The first call came in, as it turns

out, September 27th. The last call that was attributed to

Oswald came in October Ist... So we have a timespan here of five

or six days in which the calls came in, and your testimony is

that the first tape was erased prior to the receipt of the

Here we have a tape being erased well before the normal

time lag. Do you have any explanation for that?

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

MI. Goldsmith. Referring to page 28, Stack C, could

you identify this document?

Ms. Goodpasture. It is a copy of the cable sent from

Mexico to Washington, CIA Headquatters.

Mr. Goldsmith. What is the date on it?

Ms. Goodpasture, The date on it is 23 November 1963.

Mr. Goldsmith. Directing your attention to paragraph

4 of this particular document, would you please read that?

Ms. Goodpasture. Douglas J. Findglass who did transcrip-

tion said Oswald is identical to person speaking broken

Russian who called from Cuban Embassy 28 September to Soviet

Embassy•

And that, I think, was taken from the information in this

transcript, B-1, line 151.

Mr. Goldsmith. Your response then is that - 1 wi:

Ms. Goodpasture.? I think that was taken from this

statement in the October 1 transcript.

MI. Goldsmith. At any time after the assassination of

the President, did anyone go to Boris Tarasoff who is the

person referred to, whose pseudonym was Douglas Findglass

at any time after the assassination did anyone go to Mr.

Tarasoff and ask him whether the person speaking in these

conversations was the same person?

Ms. Goodpasture. I did not, but I did not see it.

The person who saw him was Herb Minell and that was his case

officer.: The outside person for the electronic surveillance

delivered tapes to me, but he did not give them guidance or

supervision. That was given to him by Mr. Minell, who would

have been the one who would have gone to him and talked to him

about this:

MI. Goldsmith. This paragraph number 4 seems to suggest,

does it not, that Findglass was actually specifically asked

whether Oswald was the same person appearing in each conversa

inconsistency?

Ms. Goodpasture, The only explanation is

the one I made

previously, is that the two tapes were still not available at

that time to compare and we had to take the transcriber's

word for it.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would also like to point out that

paragraph 2, the very last line, the first two words, it says

"probably Oswald." Is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Page 22?

Mr. Goldsmith. Page 22, the second paragraph, thellast

line, it says "probably Oswald."

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. This cable is Mexico 7023.

Then, two cables later, 7025, the fourth paragraph, it

says Douglas J. Findglass, who did transcriptions, says

Oswald is identical. We no longer have any words of qualifica

tions.

I am referring now to page 29, paragraph 4.

What page is the other one?

Two cables later, it says that Findglass says Oswald is

identical with the person speaking broken Russian who called

Miss Goodpasture, at the time that you were sitting down

and having discussions over these November 23 - over this

23 November, 1963, when you were sitting down and comparing

these two memorandum; was MI. Tarasoff ever present in the

preparation of these memos?

Ms.: Goodpasture. Did MI. Tarasoff ever --

Mr.lDodd. Was he present during the preparations of

these memos and these discussions you were having?

Ms, Goodpasture. You mean this one?

MI. Dodd. I am talking about page 22, the memorandum

on which you were the authorizing officer, the memorandum

involving paragraph 4 on page 29 where MI. Findglass says

that. Oswald is identical

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

The reason was that he was located outside of

and these were not taken outside.

Mr. Dodd. Did you ever personally speak to Mr. Tarasoff?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, I have spoken to him personally.

Mr. Dodd. Did you speak to him at the time?

Ms • Goodpasture. No. I was not in touch with him at

this time?

MI. Dodd. Did you speak to him -- how did you know he

compared the voices?

Ms • Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Dodd. How do you know he compared the voices if

you did not speak to him?

Ms, Goodpasture. I took it from this transcript, I

think, from a statement made here that he typed himself, the

typewriter.

Mr. Dodd. Let us suspend for a second.

Go ahead.

Turning to page 30 of the documents in Stack. C, this

is a duplicate of Mexico number 7025, is that correct?

Ms• Goodpasture. Yes.

MI. Goldsmith. This is the same cable that in paragraph

4 makes a reference to Findglass saying that Oswald is identi-

cal with the person who spoke broken Russian involved in the

Cuban Embassy on September 28th, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Wait a minute, I am not following you,

page 30?

MI. Goldsmith. Turn to page 30. That is a duplicate

of 7025.

That is the Mexico copy of 7025.

Ms. Goodpasture.

Mexico 7025, right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This is your copy, the one that you

referred to earlier? On page 28 and 29 was the copy that

went to headquarters, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine. We are talking about the same

cable now. In each case, paragraph 4 makes the same reference

to Oswald's being identical, et cetera, et cetera. Who was

the authenticating officer, page 32, I believe.

Ms Goodpasture. I am.

MI. Goldsmith. Turning back to page 23, which refers

to Mexico 7023, who is the authenticating officer of that

cable?

Ms• Goodpasture.. I am.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Yet, in the first cable, you say

"probably Oswald.

Station unable compare voice as first tape

erased prior receipt second call." And in the second cable:

you state, "Oswald is identical," without any language of

qualification.:

Ms• Goodpasture. I said that the transcriber said he

was identical, right?

Mr. Goldsmith. Did anything happen?

Ms. Goodpasture.. In the other one, we were unable to

have the tapes for someone else to compare them, for other

people to listen to them or to send them to headquarters for

then tolisten to them, but we did have on record from this

transcript that he had prepared that Tarasoff said that the

calls were made by the same. man.

MI. Goldsmith. You have no explanation for why the

Oswald tapes would have been erased within six days of their

receipt by the Mexico City station as opposed to within the

normal two-week period.

Ms• Goodpasture. No, I cannot explain it.

Mr. Goldsmith. One final question. Have you discussed

the testimony that you have given us today, have you discussed

that with anyone prior to coming here today?

Ms. Goodpasture. Have I discussed the testimony?

Mr. Goldsmith, Have you discussed the nature of your

testimony with anyone prior to your coming here today?

Ms. Goodpasture. The only discussion I had was a

confusion about my coming up, which I discussed when I

arrived, and there was a misunderstanding of my being brought

up here.

Mr. Goldsmith.

I am aware of that.

Have you discussed the substance of your testimony with

anybody, of what you thought would be your testimony with

anyone?

Ms, Goodpasture. No, I have not talked with anyone since

I left here yesterday•

Mr. Goldsmith.

Since you left the Committee's offices

yesterday, is that correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right. I left your office

yesterday.

MI. Goldsmith. I have nothing further. Thank you.

MI. Chairman?

MI. Doda: Mr. Preyer, do you have any questions?

MI. Preyer. I have no further questions at this time.

MI. Dodd: Mrs. Goodpasture, first of all, I would like

to request of you that you leave your address or addresses

with the Legislative Counsel öf the CIA from time to time.

so if we

feel a need to get back in touch with you, we can

contact them and they can locate you for us. If you would

do that, I would appreciate it.

Secondly, I want you to know that we are

grateful to

you for appearing before your Committee. You have been help

ful and we are grateful to you for that.

I want to apologize to you if I seemed

..to be a little

abrasive on that one point, which is that we are trying to

get to the truth of this as quickly as we can. Under our

rules of this Committee, we give each witness an opportunity

at the conclusion of their testimony to take five minutes and

sum up or add any additional information that you feel might

be helpful to this Committee or to correct what you may feel

are any inconsistencies or confusion over testimony that you

have

given this committee, and I will ask you now to take

advantage, if you would so desire, of five minutes or so to

make that summation.

Ms, Goodpasture. The only thing that I could think of

right now is that I feel that some of the papers here are

probably out of context and still have some errors in them,

and those errors that come up, I am sure theyeare human

errors and there may be more of them.

I know in this one draft of background material, I just

guessed at the dates when people were there as well as names,

as well as much of the information about the situation in

Mexico at that time, because it was to be used as a framework

for trying to pull together the documents that would be needed

to present a true picture of what the agency had in their

That is about all I can think of now.

MI. Dodd. Thank you.

All right, Miss Goodpasture, you are excused as a

witness. Again, on behalf ofither Committee, I express my

gratitude to you.

Mr. Preyer.

I want to congratulate you on your stamina

this Subcommittee, we will

stand in recess until further
