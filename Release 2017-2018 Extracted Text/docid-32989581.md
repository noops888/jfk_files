Dear Dave:

This is to confirm (belatedly) in writing what

I told you several months ago. On November 5, 1975, I

gave pp. 2-9 of

your deposition of October 21 to

Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers, with a memorandum

setting forth our agreement and your request that

Committee members be told of your concern.

Since it appears that the Senators did not

actually see your deposition, I have copied pp. 2-7

and 60-62 (which contain your final statement)

and

will see that the Committee members receive them when

they are given the draft COINTELPRO report. If

you

have any objections to this, please let me

know .

Sincerely,

Partsra

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

TO STUDY GOVERNVENTAL OPERATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to my letter dated January 22, 1976,

enclosing copies of a memorandum of the same date, with enclosures

reporting interviews conducted by the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

staff with Special Agent David Ryan of the Intelligence Division, FBI,

on October 16 and 21, 1975.

Enclosed for your information is a copy of an SSC letter

dated February 26, 1976, which was directed to Special Agent David

Ryan by Miss Barbara Ann Banoff of the SSC staff. This letter was

apparently sent in accordance with an agreement made by Banoff

with Ryan that he would continue his interview relating to this

Bureau's discontinued Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros)

only if his concern regarding the preoccupation of the SSC staff in an

area of sensationalism was communicated to the Chief Counsel and

Minority Counsel of the Committee.

This memorandum reports the review by Section Chief

William O. Gregar Of the Senate Select Committee (SSC draft

ot the Huston Report.

statists: +4453-44299 tristan

On 2/20/76, MI. Loch Johnson, SSC Staff, telephonically

contacted Cregar advising that the draft report of the ssc

on the Huston Report was completed. Johnson requested

somebody from the Bureau review the draft for accuracy. and

"for classification purposes. Contact was made with Supervisor

Paul V. Daly of the Legal Counsel Division to determine

what the ground rules were for reviewing draft reports.

After consultation with the General Counsel of the SSC,

Daly advised that the draft report had to be read in the

SSC space and that no notes describing the content.of the

report could be taken.

on the norning of 2/23/76 a

62-116 395-1434

and the afternoon of

2/24/76, Cregar reviewed the narrative portions of the

draft amounting to 127 pages. No effort was made to review

the footnotes or supportive documents to the report.

Basically, the report engaged in a histor tal?

review of the tacts leading up to the request by the President

for a meeting with Mr. Hoover and other officials at which

time he designated Mr. Hoover chairman of an ad hoc committee

responsible for preparing a report subsequently known as

the transmittal of the report to the President; the

subsequent receipt of a letter signed by Tom Charles Huston

implementing the Plan; the meeting of Mr. Hoover with then

Attorney General John Mitchell; the reaction of Attorney

General Mitchell to the Plan; and the subsequent recall of

Huston's letter by the White House.

Throughout the report, there are reflected

statements made by Various senators of the SSC during

hearings of the Committee on the Huston Plan. In addition,

there are portions of testimony by former Attorney General

Mitchell, former Director of CIA Richard Helms, and former

Chief of the Counterintelligence Staff, CIA, James Angleton,

as well as the exchanges which occurred between Senator

Church and Mitchell, Helms and Angleton. Throughout the

report, there are references to Bureau officials testifying

without naming these officials. Mr. Loch Johnson agreed

that these officials would be named and identified them

as being William C. Sullivan and Charles D. Brennan.

The report highlights the fact that there was

considerable collusion between Sullivan and Huston during_

the early stages of the preparation of this report. It

also highlights the fact that Sullivan changed his tactic

upon the resignation of Cartha D. Deloach, former Assistant

to the Director, stating that Sullivan's tactic was to

ensure that he would be designated as Deloach's replacement.

It particularly notes that Sullivan engaged in duplicity

in that he was telling Iom Charles Huston that he was in

Favor of all recommendations contained in the Huston Plan

while advising Mr. Hoover that recommendations in the

Huston Plan could cause problems for the Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

The draft report makes the observation that,

leyen though the Huston Plan was recalled by the President,

certain of its recommendations were still put into effect,

namely, the continuation of a covert mail opening program

by CIA (the Hunter Program); the intensification of the

National Security Agency's monitoring of American citizens'

overseas telephone calls; the reduction by the Bureau of

the permissible age of FBI campus informants from 21 years

to 18 years and the intensification of FBI investigations

in the internal security field.

It was pointed out to Johnson that the reduction

in the age of FBI campus informants was certainly not a

violation of the law and would appear to be ludicrous to

highlight when in fact it was nothing more than an internal

change by the FBI. Johnson recognized that it did not have

the same impact that CIA and NSA programs had and said he

would probably tinker with the language to recognize the

fact that the reduction of the informant's age from 21 years

to 18 was in no way a violation of any law or an impropriety

of any kind.

NEW INFORMATION SURFACED IN THE SSC DRAFT

The only information which appears in the SSC.

draft not previously known by the Bureau is the fact that

the Intelligence Evaluation Committee Of the Department,,

created subsequent to the rejection of the Huston Plan,

memorandum was Robert Mardian, former Assistant Attorney

General, Internal Security Division. Additionally, John

Dean, who was transterred From the Justice Department to the

white House, advised SSC Staff Members that Robert Haldeman

Re :

wanted Dean to attempt to reinstitute the abortive Huston

Plan. Dean alleges in the draft that he went along with

Halderman purely for cosmetic purposes but that he never

intended to make an effort to reinstitute the Huston Plan.

The only thing Dean agreed to was the creation of the

Intelligence Evaluation Committee with the Department.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SSC

The draft concludes with a series of recommendations.

Loch Johnson observes that most of these, if not all of the

recommendations, will probably be eliminated inasmuch as he

readily recognizes some of them are not practical and others

have been preempted by the President's new Executive Order.

However, for the benefit of the record, the following

recommendations appeared on the draft report:

(1) Any expansion of intelligence collection

operations should require (a) consultation with the agencies'.

bureaus' or departments' legal counsel before implementation;

(b) approval by the head of the agency as well as the Department

of Justice; (c) both the President and appropriate committees

of Congress be informed in advance of implementation.

Congress should provide guidance for agencies,

bureaus or departments in any intelligence collection operation.

(3) There should be better face-to-face coordination

between the heads of agencies, bureaus or departments.

(4) There should be monthly meetings of a Monthly

Intelligence Forum made up of representatives of the Congress,

the President, the Department of Justice and leading citizens.

(5) There should be penalties for ignoring any of

the above provisions.

(6) Each agency, bureau or department should have

within their ranks an Inspector General System.

(7) Appropriate committees of Congress should

review intelligence collection methods with the heads of the

agency, bureau or department under oath.

Michael Epstein, staff member, captioned Committee Director Soc'y—

requested that Unit. Chief Seymor F. Phillips be released

for a voluntary deposition concerning his knowledge of the

FBI's investigation concerning Martin Luther King, JI.! Southern

/Christian Leadership Conference, Cominfil, Stanley David

Levison, and matters relating to these investigations. Epstein

noted that SA Phillips had previously been interviewed concerning

these topics but not under oath and the purpose of this request

was to place SA Phillips under oath for testimonial purposes.

By memorandum dated 8-1-75 SA Phillips was released

from his employment agreement for purposes of a stati intervie

concerning his knowledge of the FBI's investigation concerning

Martin Luther King, Jr.

Since the topic of this particular

interview will be wider in scope, it is necessary that a new

waiver of the employment agreement be securea.

During the prior interview of SA Phillips based

on a self-imposed restriction by the Senate Select Committee,

no information was to be given concerning information developed

through wiretaps or microphone surveillance.

This was based

on discussions between Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, and Inspector John B.

Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division.

On 2-24-76 the afore-

mentioned facts were brought to the attention of Michael E.

Shaheen, JI., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,

and he stated that SA Phillips could give any information

concerning these topics to the Senate Select Committee and

if they did not desire to hear the products of electronic

surveillance that that was their decision. He noted that this

self-imposed restriction by the Senate Select Committee

concerning the Martin Luther King matter was prompted by their

anticipation of entering into an agreement with attorneys of

the king Family and the Department of Justicemancertingel4o

ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Within the past several months newspapers in the

San Diego, California, area have been denouncing the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) because of allegations

that the FBI promoted guerrilla-type warfare against blacks

and political dissidents and the FBI's involvement with the

Secret Army Organization (SAO).

On January 28, 1976, Special Agent in Charge (SAG)

San Diego, furnished a

copy of an article from the January 27,

1976,

San Diego Union" Newspaper which attributes to

Michael Madigan, an SSC investigator,

the statement that

.. • his four-day visit to California has confirmed most

news reports about I'Bt. Involvement with the SAO's guerrilla

var against political dissidents in san Diego during the

The news report referred to in this statement

includes a nine article series printed by the "San Diego

Union" which contains allegations of illegal conduct by the

FBI in connection with the SAO.

As you are aware there have been allegations the

FBI created, financed and controlled the SAO, a now defunct

anticommunist, paramilitary organization that was headquertered

in San Diego and these allegations have been furnished to you.

Mr. Madigan stated that he was upset over the

distortions and inaccurate information appearing in this

The

Mri Gerald Warren

Editor

San Diego Union

P.0. Box 191

• San Diego, California 92112

Dear Mr. Warren:

I was surprised to read the article entitled "Report Duu" on

FBI Probe" which appeared on the front page of the San Diego Union

of January 27, 1976. The article contained statements attributed

to me which were false. I regret to say that I feel this inaccu-

rate reporting was done intentionally by your reporter, Mr. Dillon,

in a brazen attempt to buttress his earlier articles about the SAO.

Specifically, Dillon's article states:

"Madigan said his four-day visit to California has

• confirmed most news reports about FBI involvement

with the SAO's guerrilla war against political

•dissidents in San Diego during the early 1970's.

His article goes on to say:

"The FBI was 'very much involved' with the Secret Army

. Organization, a Senate investigator said here yesterday

after interviewing the SAO co-founder and former. FBI

informant Howard Berry Godfrey."

Both of these statements attributed to me are false. I never made

such statements to Dillon or anyone else. Io the contrary, what

few things I did say to Dillon were almost the opposite. More

particularly, I asked him where the evidence was for the statement

reported in his January 11, 1976 article which claimed that the FBI

"created a group known as the Secret Army Organization. ..."

told Dillon that our investigation had uncovered no such evidence.

With a slicepish smile, Dillon implied that he knew of no

evidence

Sex, that statement and had overstated the case. While the record

of the FBI's involvement with its informer Godfrey does not prescht

a pleasant picture, I now feel compelled to state publicly that,

in my opinion, the Sằn Diego Union articles by MI. Dillon have

presented an exaggerated picture of what really happened..

As I indicated in my telephone conversation on January 30,

1976 with Mr. McArthur of your newspaper, I am requesting that

you print this letter as testimony of your newspaper's sense of

fair. play, honesty and accurate reporting; a sense which your

reporter lacked. The people of San Diego are entitled

to no less.

subversive groups which sponsored demonstrations

can be found in a 1971 pamphlet entitled "The Assault

on Freedon" prepared for the Subcommittee to

Investigate the Administration of the Internal

Security Aci, and Other Internal Security Laws

of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States

Senate. Pages 89-101.)

The antivar movement, which began in the

United States in the 1960's, was merely a prelude to a

major struggle by Marxist-Leninist groups in this country

to build a mass movement against the Government. The

antivar movement centered around demonstrations and was

later broadened by these groups to include a wide range

of controversial domestic issues, such as poverty, racisn,

unemployment, and foreign policy.

Although earlier demonstrations were planned and

organized by the Stadents for a Democratic Society (SDS, see

appendix), the antiwar movement eventually led to mass

demonstrations during the early 1970's, sponsored by two

communist-influenced organizations, the National Peace Action

Coalition (NPAC), and the Peoples Coalition for Peace and

Justice (PCPJ) •

RE:

lajor Denonstrations or Disturbances Which Ocourred

in the United States During the Period 1965-75,

in which bonestic Subversive Groups Played a Significant

Role

Loadoro of the MIC maintained almost constant contact

with the govornments of Cuba, North Viotnan, and repre-

sentatives of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

When differences in strategy among IMC leaders occurred,

the followars of the SuP formed the NAC,

and. the followers

of the CP formed the PCPJ. the

"New Mobe" had included

many groups, but one of the most influential groups in it

was the Students Mobilization Commictoo to Ind the War in

Viotnam (SMC) •

the SiC was controlled by the Young socialist

Alliance (VSA), the youth ari of the stiP.

The NPAC, undor the influence of the SiP, wanted

to follow a single issuc, the war, and a single tactic,

massive rallies and marches. NPAC insistod, however,

that

chesc be poncoful domonstrations. The PCPJ, under the

influenco of the CP, in addition to demonstrations, was

committod also to include issuor on povorty, racion, and

ropression. In addition, other tactics included civil

disobedience, The Irotskyists in NPAC did not roject the

ace of civil disobedience and violonce, but felt it was

premature for such actions as they would bo counterproductive.

In 1971, the top loadership of PCPJ included five

norbers of the CP.

Sinilarly, loadership of the NPAC was

cloninated by nanocre or the sus..

In fact, four of the national

coordinators of the NiAC were affiliated with the swe: in

addition, the NPAC sicering cormitice was dominatod by SiP

and/or YSA membors.

The first large scale antivar acnonstration

organized by the NIC and SNC occurred in April, 1967,

whon 100,000 assombled in New York, and 50,000 in

San Francisco. Iron that poinc, the nature of peaceful

armonstrations changed as depictod by the violent assault

on the Pentagon during Octobor 24-27,

1967.

• Re:

Major Denonscrations or Disturbances Which Occurred

in the United States During the Period 1965-75,

In Which DomestiC subversive Groups Played a significant

Role

The "March on the Pentagon" was followed by the

confrontation in Chicago in August, 1968, during the

Derocratic National Convention, and the offori to disrupt

the Presidential Inauguration in Washington in January,

1969 .

The controntation by antivar activists

at the

National Convention resulted in Chicago authorities being

challenged to maintain concrol of the situation, with tho

premeditated intention by WNC loaders to instigate disorder

and provoke violence.

In this rogard, fron september, 1969, to July, 1970,

1792 demonstrations occurred in the Unitod States resulting

in 7561 arrescs, 462 individuals injured, and incluiing &

deaths.

Total damages were estinated to

be around $10

million.

The massive demonstration on April 24, 1971,

sponsored by NPAC in concert with worldwide denonstrations

on that date organized by the fourth International (FI, sec

appondix) was, for the most part, peacoful with sone isolated

incidents of violence reported.

The NPAC and PCPJ reccived solidarity support

fron foceign cormunisis and joined in the spring of 1971,

¿o bring about thoir most massive and protracied struggle.

the largest demonsirations ever held took place during April 24 -

Day 4, 1971, at Washington, D. C.

this gave the novemont ronewed

emphasis to

"set the dato"

for withdrawal fron Vietnam, and Ec

schedule anti-U. S. demonstrations at U.S. Embassios around the

world on July 4, 1971, in unison with communist groups in other

countries.

The organizational skill and discipline of cho

rIotskyists was clearly demonscraced by the snooch way il

wich plans for action were carcied out in the course of ¿h‹

demonstrations on April 24, 1971. In contrast to peaceful

denonstrations on April 24, 1971, PCPJ planneù civil dis

obedionoe during new domonstrations for the first wook of

May, 1971. PCPJ called for total disruption of the functions

cransportation, tying up the telephone system and the

"liberating" of various Government buildings. These parti

cular demonstrations sought so bring the U. S. Covernment

to a halt, and insisted on Congress ratifying a "People's

Peace Ircaty" which had been drafted in Hanoi, North Vietnam.

During the PCPJ sponuorea week of demonstrations,

violence became so intense that on May 3, 1971, troops wore

lined shoulder-to-shoulder across Bemorial Bridge and to a

lesser degree on the 14th Street Bridge leading to

Washingion, D. C.

Vehicles were abandoned in the middle of

strcets attompting to block traffic, ropes were run across

strects, and large groups of demonstrators joinod axm-to-arn

at intersections for the purpose of shutting down ordorly

business in the city.

Without Foderal troops and enormous

numbers of police officers, it is clear the avoved purpose

of demonsiration leaders would have becn acconplished.

rainers o1 gasoline, two 20 pound tanks of propane gas:, two

pachages of plastic explosive totaling over three pounds in

seight, and two electric blasting caps. All devices were dis-

arned by the NYCPD Bomb Squad.

Hand-printed literature of the Black September Or

canization, an Arab terrorist group, was found in all of the

automobiles. It is believed that the automobiles containing

(ho explosive devices were left near the Israeli establishments

sometime during the late afternoon or early evening of March 3,

1973. The explosive devices were capablo of detonation but

sailed to do so due to a defect in the electrical circuitry of

the devices.

Subsequent

investigation by the FBI developed the

sollowing facts concerning KHALID AL-JAWARY:

AL-JAWARY entered the United States at Boston,

Inssachusetts, from Montreal, Canada, aboard Delta Airlines

flaglit 025 on January 12, 1373. Upon his arrival on a B-?

(isitor's) visa issued in Beirut, Lebanon, he furnished In~

formation to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)

PLOT BY AL FATAH TO ASSASSINATE

KING HUSAYN OF JORDAN DURING HIS

VISIT TO ES TALED STATES, DARCH, 1072(9)

A double agent of this Bureau, who was initially

recruited by Al Fatah in the Middle East to set up assassi

nation plots against U.S. political leaders, advised during

March, 1972, that Al Fatab intended to attempt to assassinate

King Husayn of Jordan during his visit to the United States

in March, 1972. (5)

As a result of the information obtained from this

source, we obtained the names of

more than 500 Arab

individuals who had applied for visas to enter the

United States during the visit of King Husayn. These names

were checked with the source who identified three visa

applicants as members of the Assassination Section of Al Fatan.

This information was forwarded to Secret Service who had

protective responsibility for King Husayn during his visit

and to the State Department for appropriate action with

respect to denying visas to these individuals. (5)

During King Husayn's visit there were no incidents

involving his safety.

Ojeda was charged by the Police of Puerto Rico with violation

of the Explosives Law of Puerto Rico. He subsequently became

a fugitive and FBI assistance was

obtained by local authorities

to effect his apprehension. Based principally upon FBI

investigation and information provided by a confidential

informant, Ojeda was apprehended by the FBI On 10/10/70, 012

a charge of Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution - Explosives

Law of Puerto Rico. After his release on bond, Ojeda jumped

thai bond and is at the present time an EBI fugitive. He is

also a prime suspect in the numerous terroristic bombings

which have recently occurred in New York City and Puerto Rico.

RE: PARTIDO SOCIALISTA OBRERO (Socialist Workers Party) (PSO)

This organization should not be confused with the

Trotskyist sMP.

PSO was created in Puerto Rico in 1968 under the

subversive banner of Marxism-Leninism as expounded by the

Maoist Chinese.

PSO advocated armed revolution in its endeavor.

to obtain independence of Puerto Rico from the United States.

The FBI initiated investigation of PSO in Puerto Rico in 1968

and in due course confidential informants were developed.

Puerto Rico and based principally upon information provided

by IBI sources, the Police of Puerto Rico were enabled to

arrest nine PSO members on 4/29/69, on charges of violating

the Puerto Rican Explosive Law.

FBI sources reported in 196S that within PSO a

clandestine extension was developing. That development became

Inown as Movimiento Independentista Revolucionario En Armas (MIRA).

RE: MIRA

. •

MIRA was organized in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, in

December, 1968, as the covert action arm of the PSO, referred

to above. It was composed of select PSO members who, 'for the

most part, were trained in Cuba to carry out waves of terrorism,

sabotage and incendiarism directed against American-owned

establishments in Puerto Rico and other "imperialist" targets

such as the National Guard and other military installations in

Puerto Rico.

Several MIRA targets were also victimized in

New York City.

Cuban principals. Confidential informants operated by the FBI

provided information disclosing that MIrA

also had a resident

branch located in New York City which was headed by Carlos

Feliciano Vasquez, another U. S. citizen of Puerto Rican

extraction. As a result of FBI investigation and information

provided by FBI informants, the New York City Police Department

arrested Feliciano in May, 1970, while he was in the act of

placing a pipe bomb in New York City. Had that bomb detonated

it would have had devastating results. Feliciano was identified

as an individual completely dedicated to obtaining the

On September 30, 1975, the New Yorls Office of the

FBI advised the Los Angeles Office that one Mary Kochiyama

had attempted to obtain a press pass, which was to be utilized

in connection with the visit of the Imperor and Impress of

TERRORIST ACTIVITY

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED EXCEPT

nluoo

WHERE SHOWN OTHERWISE.

DECLASSIFY ON:

Bombings were the primary terrorist tactic in this

country last year. There were 89 bombings attributable to terrorist

activity in 1975, as compared with 45 in 1974 and 24 in 1973.

Six persons died in terrorist-claimed bombings in

1975 and 76 persons were injured. Five other deaths were reported

in other types of terrorist incidents. Monetary damage reported in

terrorist bombings exceeded 2. 7 million dollars.

The New World Liberation Front, a revolutionary group

operating primarily in California, claimed 19 bombings in 1975, pri-

marily targeted against a public utility. The Armed Forces of Puerto

Rican National Liberation (FALN) claimed 18 bombings, targeted

against Government and corporate targets, especially banks, in New York

City, Chicago, and Washington, D. C.

FALN

The Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation,

or FALN, took credit for the most serious terrorist bombing reported

in 1975: the explosion which claimed four lives on January 24 at the

Fraunces Tavern in New York City. The group claimed a total of 18

bombings and one attempted bombing in 1975.

The capabilities of the FALN were also illustrated by

the simultaneously coordinated attacks against "Yanki government and

monopoly capitalist institutions" in New York, Chicago, and Washington,

D. Co, on October 27, 1975, the "first anniversary of our existence as

an organization" in the words of the FALN communique issued in

connection with these bombings. (The group's first claimed bombings --

against five corporate and banking targets--took place October 26, 1974).

Half of the FALN-claimed bombings took place in New York

in 1975, and half were directed against banks. Weekends or Mondays

before business hours were the time of three-fourths of FALN bombings.

The group has demanded independence for Puerto Rico and freedom for

five Puerto Rican "political prisoners," nationalists convicted of attacks

on President Truman and the U. S. House of Representatives in the 1950's.

NWLF

The New World Liberation Front (NWLF) claimed 19

bombings and one attempted bombing in 1975; all but one of these took

place in California. A primary target of this group has been the property

of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The NWLF has not shown any

time pattern in their attacks, but have consistently carried out actions

almost every month of the past year.

While previous NWLF actions have attacked targets con-

nected with international issues, i.e., hotels leased by a multinational

corporation in protest of alleged corporate actions abroad, recent attacks

have focused on local issues. Besides demanding cuts in local utility

rates for individuals, as opposed to businesses, recent communiques

have concerned "poor people's health" and actions of San Francisco city:

government. Credit has been taken in NWLF communiques for four

recent automobile bombings in San Francisco, aimed at police.

WEATHER UNDERGROUND

This self-described "guerrilla organization" of "communist

women and men, underground in the United States" claimed three bombings,

and one attempt, in 1975. The first Weather Underground (WU) bombing;

on January 29, was against the State Department in Washington, D. C.

At the same time, another WU-claimed bomb failed to go off at a Depart-

ment of Defense facility in Oakland, California.

On June 16, the group claimed the bombing of New York

City bank and on September 5, a bombing that caused $150, 000 damage at

the Kennecott Copper Building in Salt Lake City was claimed by the WU.

This bomb had been placed in a ladies' room; the State Department bomb

had also been placed in a wall with access from a ladies' room.

WU published four issues of its newsletter, Osawatomie,

in 1975, and its aboveground support arm, Prairie Fire Organizing

Committee, also issued a publication, Groundswell. The group demanded:

"Stop U. S. aid to the junta in Chile" in the communique claiming the Salt

Lake City bombing and each issue of Osawatomie has said of the Bicentennial:

"The rulers have set the time for the party; let us bring the fireworks."

Four other revolutionary-type groups claimed significant

• bombing activities in 1975. Safeway grocery stores have been the targets

of two groups. The George Jackson Brigade claimed four bombings in

Washington State, half against Safeway. The Emiliano Zapata Unit (EZU)

took credit for three Safeway bombings (and one Bank of America bombing)

in the San Francisco area since the end of October, 1975. One EZU

communique spoke of children suffering from malnutrition and threatened:

"We will kill to protect our children."

The Red Guerrilla Family claimed three bombings in

California in March, April, and July, targeting Government in two cases.

in Denver, Colorado, the Continental Revolutionary Army (CRA) took

credit for four bombings in 1975 against primarily Government targets.

The last CRA communique attacked U. S. activities abroad--in Panama,

Chile, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and North Vietnam.

Black Liberation Army (BLA) activity in 1975 was limited

to four escape attempts. A major portion of the group is incarcerated

for the numerous attacks on police and bank robberies that have been

linked to the BLA since 1971. One of these jailbreak attempts, on May 25

in New York City, resulted in the death of a BLA member when his bed-

sheet rope broke during a ten-story descent to the ground.

AIM

Indian occupants of two vehicles were arrested November 14,

1975, by Oregon State Police at Ontario, Oregon, after an exchange of

gunfire with an officer. It was later determined that Leonard Peltier,

charged with the June 26, 1975, murder of two FBI Agents, had been

involved in this incident

and had escaped.

Timing devices and other bomb components were found in

the two vehicles, along with nine high-powered rifles, some with serial

mumbers obliterated, two police-type shotguns, and three heavy caliber

pistols. Seven fifty-pound cases of dynamite were seized and there were

indications the individuals involved were interested in Bicentennial activities.

American Indian Movement (AIM) leader Dennis Banks has

Said, On December 16, 1974, in a Sacramento, California, television

interview, that a goal of AIM is to "stop the Bicentennial celebration,"

Another AIM leader Vernon Bellecourt, Said in a March 15, 1973, speech

at Berkeley, California, that "by 1976, the 200th anniversary of the founding

of the U. iS., AlM will be powerful enough to blow out the candles on the

birthday cake."

• We have at this moment no specific reported information

that international terrorist groups will target the Bicentennial celebrations

for a terrorist act. Hewever, many of the groups and organizations cur-

rently of investigative interest to the Bureau have made veiled threats concerning

terrorism during Bicentennial celebrations. Domestic groups such as the

Peoples Bicentennial Commission; the American Indian Movement; the

Weather Underground and other revolutionary "New Left" type groups

have threatened actions to disrupt the celebrations. Foreign-inspired

or financed groups such as the Palestine liberation movement, the Puerto

Rican independence groups, as well as South and Central American liberation

organizations have reportedly talked about disrupting the Bicentennial by

acts of terrorism. Past experience has shown that it is events such as the

Bicentennial, which are the focus of worldwide attention, that have become

the target of the international terrorist in order to obtain maximum notoriety

for their cause. In connection with the Bicentennial, there will be numerous

foreign dignitaries and heads of state visiting the United States and any group,

whether domestic or foreign which feels that it has a "cause" against that

particular individual, could strike while that dignitary or head of state was

in the United States.

For example, the Queen of England will visit the

United States early July, 1976, and a terrorist group such as the Irish

Republican Army (IRA) which has not committed any terrorist acts in the

United States to date could conceivably target the Queen for assassination

or attempt kidnapping while she was in the United States. We must remember

that terrorism is theatre and what better stage than an attack during the

Bicentennial celebrations, our election year, or the Olympics in Canada.

The Puerto Rican independence groups have shown by their

bombing of historic Fraunces Tavern in New York City that they are com-

mitted to terrorist acts against sites holding historic value to the United

States. It has been reported many of the Puerto Rican terrorists have been

trained in Cuba and receive substantial aid for their terrorist acts from that

country. As, once again, relations have cooled between the United States

• and Cuba, it can be expected Cuba will not act as a restraining agent to

prevent further acts of terrorism by their trained Puerto Rican terrorists

in the United States.

Of prime concern also during the Bicentennial is the form-

ing of a new Arab terrorist group made up of elements from the "Rejection

Front'' and headed by the international notorious terrorist "Carlos" true

name Ilich Ramirez Sanchez. This new group is reportedly backed by both (5)

- 4-

SECRET

HH 55156 DooId:32989581 Page 59

## Page 60

SECRET

÷.

Libya and Algeria and its targets are Western Government leaders.

Prior terrorist acts in which Sanchez has been connected with have

always been on the spectacular side, i.e. (OPEC), and the events

during the Bicentennial offer a perfect stage. (S)

Other groups of the Palestine liberation movement,

such as Al Fatah and its terrorist wing, the Black September Organi-

zation, have ceased international terrorist operations since the Palestine

Liberation Organization (PLO) has received observer status at the UN

This, of course, is no guarantee that these terrorist organizations will

not resume international terrorist operations if they feel thai a political

solution cannot be achieved at the UN. (5)

The Jewish Defense League (JDL) has apparently

embarked once again on a systematic terrorist binge directed at those

countries in the UN who voted for the resolution equating Zionism with

racism. The JDL readily reflects the feelings of the Israeli Govern-

ment in the United States. Any decision reached by international bodies,

such as the UN, which adversely affect Israel becomes the JDL's cause,

and they strike out on behalf of Israel against the countries voting for

the adverse action against Israel. Thus far, there have been ten incidents

involving ten different missions to the UN. These have been rock throwing

incidents, intrusion onto mission property, one bombing and attempted

bombings at missions and at the UN itself. A member of the JDL in

November, 1974, on public television openly threatened the life of Yasir

Arafat, the leader of the PLO. Arab establishments in the United States

and Arab diplomats continue to be targets of the JDL.

Other terrorist groups such as the Japanese Red Army

and the anti-Castro elements within the United States, have proven by

their actions that they are a credible threat against

dignitaries who

might visit the United States during Bicentennial activities. The IRA

has engaged in terrorist operations in Britain, breaking away from the

traditional urban guerrilla warfare they had engaged in in Northern

Ireland by adopting the terrorist weapon of bombings, hoping to cause

hysteria in major cities within Britain. Individuals connected with

anti-Castro groups in the United States have engaged in numerous

attempted and actual bombings of Cuban establishments throughout

North and South America. They have engaged in mail and book bombs

directed to Cuban establishments, as well as the bombing of banking

institutions and other commercial firms which deal with Cuba.

Under Public Law 92-539, the "Act for the Protection

of Foreign Officials and Official Guests of the United States, " the FBI

has investigated approximately 900 incidents. These incidents range

from the mugging of an Ambassador's wife to the armed takeover of a

foreign embassy. They also include such things as the harassment of

a foreign Consular official by telephone and the bombing of a foreign

mission to the United Nations.

Public Law 92-539 provides for concurrent jurisdiction

between the FBi and local police departments. The facts of any violation

are immediately presented to the U. S. Attorney for his opinion as to

whether FBI investigation is warranted. As a general rule, the U.S.

Attorney will authorize FBI investigation only when the violation is a

major one and when there are aspects of foreign policy to be considered.

One example of a major PFO violation investigated by

the FBI is the attempted bombing of the United Nations. Five sticks

of dynamite were found in the United Nations on August 7, 1974, by a

United Nations security guard. Even though the Secretary General of

the United Nations refused to allow the FBI to enter United Nations grounds,

the case was solved and one Michael Halsey Brown, a member of the

American Nazi Party, was convicted under the Protection of Foreign

Officials statute and

sentenced to 25 years in the custody of the Attorney

General.

Another example is the armed takeover of the Philippine

Embassy. On November 18, 1974, Napoleon Bayaga Lechoco, armed

with a firearm, took over the Philippine Chancery, Washington, D. C.

Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez and Attache Mario S. Lagdameo

were taken as hostages, but remainder of Embassy personnel escaped.

The FBI immediately responded to the scene and took

overall charge of the efforts to neutralize the situation, following receipt

of the U. S. Attorney's opinion that a Federal investigative presence was

warranted. FBI contingency plans developed for such a situation were

utilized.

At approximately 2:00 a.m., November 19, 1974,

subject surrendered to FBI Agents.

On June 25, 1975, Lechoco was found guilty on seven

counts including violations of the Act for the Protection of Foreign Officials.

He was later sentenced to ten years in the custody of the Attorney General.

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY

The Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) is a

revolutionary, Trotskyist-communist organization, which

is headquartered in New York City.

Its purpose,

as

stated in its Declaration of Principles, is the overthrow

of the U.S. Government and the institution of a dictatorship

of the working class and the eventual achievement of

communist society. It was founded in 1938 and maintains

close

association

with international Trotskyist organizations

as a

"sympathizing" group, but it denias formal membership

1n any foreign group to escape application of the voorhis

Act, which regulates certain types of organizations subject

to foreign control.

While the SWP does not openly advocate

the use of violence at the present time to overthrow the

U.S. Government, 1t believes that eventual violent revolution

in the U.S. is inevitable.

Its objection to the current

use of violence is based on the ground that it believes

violence is premature at this time.

The SWP seeks to

precipitate a revolution when conditions

are ripe and to

seize control of the revolution and

to direct it when it

occurs.

According to lilton Rosen, National

Chairman, the PLP advocates violent overthrow of the Government,

In 1972, the PLP organized the Workers Action

Movement (WAN) as a front group in order to build a base

in the trade union movenent and to attract workers into PLP.

U. S. Senate Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

The matter of documenting Levison's CPUSA membership

has been addressed in prior SSC requests, and FBI responses

thereto.

For example, in response to an sse request dated

Noverber 7, 1975, FBI

memorandum dated November 20, 1975,

brought to notice the highly sensitive oral briefing turnished

to Senator Church and

selected members of the SSC Staff by FBI

personnel on Novenber 5, 1975. It was stated that this briefing

bxtefing

was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any written informa-

tion in response to SSC requests for communications documenting

Levison as a secret member of the CPUSA.

The FBI memorandum dated February 6, 1976, responding

to the other Items in the January 23, 1976, request, also

elucidates on FBI documentation supporting

the reported CPUSA

membership of Levison.

Once again, we are reiterating our position, which

remains unchanged, that our briering of Senator Church and

selected SSC Staff Members was sufficiently candid and

informative to have resolved any doubt as to Levison's communist

background,

including

hismembership in the CPUSA.

As those

who were briefed are fully aware,

this Bureau, at considerable

risk to the security, personal and otherwise,

of several

individuals,

"walked the extra mile" with the Committee.

Security considerations, personal and otherwise,

are still

paranount.

In good conscience,

we are unable to be more

informative in this matter which the Committee continues to

pursue.

NOTE:

Shaheen's advise as to modification of Item 3 was to

CONDUCTED BY THE FBI

Reference is made to the SSC letter of November 21,

1975, requesting delivery of materials pertaining to the

authorization and purpose of certain electronic surveillances

conducted by the FBI.

The SSC letter of November 21 referenced a surmary

chart prepared by the FBI showing electronic surveillances

conducted by the FBI since 1960.

This chart was furnished to

the SSC by memorandum of October 23, 1975.

This memorandum effects delivery of documents

responsive to Items 2, 4, 5, 6, 8-10, 12-16, 18-21, 23-24,

28, and 30.

Response

to Item Il is being furnished by

separate communication in response to a request contained in

SSC letter February 5, 1976. The remainder of Items not

delivered by this menorandum were delivered in menoranda of

Dear Mr. Kelley:

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE 11160 BYSPLALMen

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

I am in receipt of your letter dated January 23, 1976,

and will forwara a copy of my book to you as soon as I receive

then.

In regards to my interview with Mark Epstein from Senator

Church's committee, the following is a brief summary:

I am no longer sure as to the exact dates but as

best as I can remember it was on July 17,1975 that I received

a call from Paul Avery who is a reporter for the San Francisco

Chronicle.

Paul asked me if I would object to being interviewed

by an investigator from Senator Church's committee. I told

him that I had no reason not to talk to anyone from any committee.

and told Paul to have him give me a call.

The next day, wnich would be July 18, 1975, a man who said

he was Mark Epstein called me and said he was from Senator

Church's committee and that Paul Avery had given him my name

and phone number.

He requested a meeting on that very day as he had to

"return to washington that evening. I told him he could come

"to my house for the interview.

He arrived at my house at about 2:00 PM and stayed until

Fabout 5:00 PM. He asked me to give him a full description of my

activities with the F.B.I. and the Weather Underground. I started

from the beginning and as the story unfolded he interrupted as he

I desired additional information."

As the interview progressed, I became-aware that the only

time he interrupted me was when he thought he had discovered

some mistake the F.B.I. had possibly maue.

A good example of this is in regards to the Detroit

police Officer's Association bombing plot. This was the only

bombing plot that I was involved in while I was with the

bin 8l0e 7

¿Weathermen and Mr. Epstein found it very interesting. He

was mainly interested in what the F.B.I. had said and done in

regards to my activities in this plot.

What was the F.B.I.

going to do when the time came to actually place the bomb, he

asked over and over gain. Since Bill Ayers had told me to

¡forget the DPOA bombing and go to Madison, 'Wisconsin instead,

¡I could not accurately answer his question as my part in the .

plot came to an ena perore the bono was to be placed.

I dia

¡remember that Carl O'Gara, who was the F.3.1. agent that i was

¡in contact with in Detroit at the time, had told me to be very

#careful as to what part I took in the planning, and under no

¡circumstances was I to initiate any action.

MI. Epstein found this a little difficult to believe

ox at least thet is what he said. The entire interview went

this way until MI. Epstein felt that he had heard enough.

As he was leaving, he told me that he did not expect that

the committee would ask me to testify. Upon hearing this I

asked why, was there any problem? Mi. Epstein replied, "well.

you really do not have very much bad to say about the f.B.I.,

"now do you"? No, I suppose not was my answer to this statement

and I repeated as I had throughout the entire interview that

never once during my association with the F.B.I. was I asked

'to do anything illegal, quite the contrary if anyching the

•Bureau was constantly reminding me to be extremely careful of

¡what I did and said, so as not to instigate anything.

MI. Epstein left telling me that he would be in touch

with me in about two weeks.

After waiting for his call for

about a month I decided to call him at which time he informed

me that a decision had not been made in regards to my testimony.

"I called him on several different occasions and he was never there,

and never returned my calls,

After reading about the testimony that the ex-

KIu-Klux-Klan informer gave about F.B.I. activities in the

south I realized that the probable reason that I was not

ficalled was because Senator Church's committee found somébody

"that had nothing but bad things to say about the F.B.I.

I hope this will be helpful to you and your impending

struggle to maintain the F.B.I.'s integrity. I do not believe

that Senator Church's connittee is as unbiased as they would like

people to believe and as I can understand where the over zealousness

•of individual agents could cause mistakes to be made that does

not. necessarily mean that the entire F.B.I. is guilty.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

ShAh

I talked to Special Agent Jack Baker, of the San Francisco

Field Office, yesterday. He told me of your request to show the

letter that I wrote to you, concerning the Church Committee. I

have no objection to you using that letter in any way that you may

deem necessary.

I sent that information to you, with the hope that it would

in some way help in your struggle to maintain the f.B.I.'s integ-

rity.

If Senator Church and his Committee are really trying br

establish reasonable guide lines for F.B.I. activities, then

ertoft shoula have been made to present the correct as well as the

Incorrect methods that are employed to gather intelligence infor

mation.

* feel that my experience with the F.B.I. qualifies me tu

say something about the correct methods that were used in my case.

and why the Church Committee chose to ignore me is a little diffi-

cult to understand.

3

I would like to add that it is my belief that if the intelli-

gence community is greatly weakened, at this crucial time, the

terrorist problem is going to grow accordingly. Mistakes may have

been made in the past but this does not negate the fact that the

acts of terrorism, in this country,

have increased tremendously

in the last few years and will continue to do so if little or nothing

is done to put a stop to it.

I believe that my experience with the

Weathermen qualifies me to, speak out on this issue as well.

As you have said, Mr. Kelley, "the American people are going

to have to decide which they fear the most. the F.B.I. or the

MAR

terrorist." There are many organizations; in the United States

today, that advocate the violent overthrow of our Government.

These

people must be watched as the possibility

exists that

violent rhetoric may change into violent a ReLiu

This is to record transmittal of certain documents to the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) by the Department of Justice.

BACKGROUND

By SSC letter to the Attorney General (AG) dated 2/4/76

(copy attached), a request was made for certain documents which the c

Department of Justice recently made available to the attorneys for

the plaintiffs in a pending civil action entitled "Iberia Hampton, et al.,

v. Edward Hanrahan, et al. (U. S. D. C., N. D., Illinois). "

As current and former personnel of the Chicago Office

of the FBI are named as defendants in the civil action, the question

arose as to whether or not these documents could be released to the

SSC. Subsequent contact with the U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago

determined that the documents had been made available to the plain-

tits attorays and were aot untratective court oder.

REC-50 /

54-1420

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special

Counsel for Intelli-.

gence Coordination, Department of Justice, telephonically advised

on 2/9/76 that the Department had ruled that the documents could be

furnished to the SSC. Consequently, copies of the documents were

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. JENKINS

RE:

ENATE SELECT COMMITTEE REFORT

As announced in the February 84, 1978, meeting of the Executives

Conference, it is expected

bat the Senate Select Committee Report will be

out about March 15, 1976.

It to thought probable that we will be criticized

on several pointa.

As I explained to the Conference, we should now start gathering

together the body of material decessary in order to draw up either a simul-

taneous release at the time the report is given publication or to follow

immediately afterwards. There is no reason why we cannot defend our

selves on this occasion, particularly in developing statements to the eflect

that:

Certain harm has caine to the Bureau as a resuit of the

revelations made by leaks or careless handling.

2.

There have been repeated reports that persons called lor

interview before members of the staff have been asked to

give gossip," rumors, and other unfounded information upon

which apparently some concluslong bave been drawn which

are totally unfounded. -- such an approach'is, of course, not

avallable to us and certataly not considered as a prolesslonal-

type approach.

3.

or inquiries, we have done some things which indicate our

Director See'y —

The report of the Senate Select Committee on

Intelli-

gence (Church Committee) is reportedly to be completed and

released approximately March 15th.

We have already been

provided with a number of documents which the Church Committee

intends to publish in connection with its forthcoming report.

As expected, these documents clearly indicate that the Bureau

will be in for substantial criticism. It can be expected that

the report will be released with the usual hoopla and with

appropriate media exposure.

It is the teeling of the External Affairs Division.

that after almost a year of intensive investigation and

resultant publicity that the American public are tired of

listening to the same old faces making the same old accusations;

It is felt that steps should be taken to prepare for the release

of the Church Committee report and have information available

which can be provided to the field and media contacts of the

an he provided to the t

External Affairs Division countering the criticism of the Church

Committee report.

It can be readily expected that the COINTELPRO

and the alleged

harassment of Martin Luther King, as well as the

use of informants, will be the principal areas of criticism.

The External Affairs Division feels that representatives

of the Intelligence Division and the External Affairs Division

should begin immediately to review the aforementioned critical

areas in order to adequately prepare responses

to the forthcoming

Church Committee report.

While the forthcoming Senate Select Committee report

may be expected to be highly critical of past alleged FBI abuses,

we do not anticipate it will include many, if any, new revelations.

Numerous memoranda, position papers, and briefing materials

have been prepared regarding past areas of criticism. While it

is not believed feasible to prepare additional general briefing

material in anticipation of the release of the report, Intelligence

Division is available to brief External Affairs relating to specific

areas of past criticism and to promptly respond to any new allega-

tions resulting from the report.

Re:

62-116395

Chief Counsel Frederick A. O. Schwartz - During

discussion concerning Bureau investigation of

domestic organizations, Mr. Schwartz requested

a list of readily available major demonstrations.

in this country for which domestic subversive

organizations were responsible.

OBSERVATIONS:

A copy of the now defunct "Attorney General's

Subversive List" has been obtained by the Senstudy Project

Unit. Regarding the list of major disturbances for which

domestic subversive organizations were responsible,

although no date was set, it is believed that such a list

covering the years 1965-1975 would be responsive to the

request of Mr. Schwartz.

It is believed preferable that the above-requested

material be obtained or prepared by the sections of the

Intelligence Division listed below and responsive material

forwarded to the Senstudy Project Unit for inclusion in

one cover communication directed to the Attorney General

for referral to the SSC.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the IS-1 Section prepare and send to

the Senstudy Unit an appropriate reply to Senator Morgan's

request for information concerning alleged payments made

by this Bureau to George F. Dorsett.

The Honorable Clarence M. Kelley

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Mr

Kelley:

I am in receipt of your letter of January 30, 1976 in which you

referred to my comments before the Asheville Area

Chamber of Commerce.

It is sad for me to tell you that the statements attributed to me are

substantially what I said to the Chamber. I am convinced, after

personally observing countless FBI documents as a member of the Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence, and after observing some of those

charged with the responsibility of responding to committee inquigies

directed to the FBl, that the Bureau does constitute a serious threat

to the individual liberties of American citizens.

I doubt that anyone can read of the many actions of lawlessness

committed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the last decade;

of the unwarranted domestic surveillance, bugging,

and wiretapping,

without concluding that the Bureau is not far from being in the same

condition it was in when Attorney General Harlan Stone reorganized it

in the 20's.

In addition, Mr. Kelley, I have seen very little in the

actions of the top echelon of the Bureau to indicate to me that there

is any real change in the philosophy of those who direct it.

response to the mention of the actions of wrongdoing

o the detonat

The usual

has been in the

nature of, "We have made some mistakes in the past..." or,

"We were wrong,

but...

ST-111

REC50 02416395-1412

In your letter you state, "Understandably, such sentiments are most

disturbing to my associates and to me."

As one who had been an ardent

admirer of Mr. Hoover and the Bureau for many years, the sentiments are

disturbing to me also. They are, however, the direct result of reading

the Bureau's own documents and of hearing the testimony of Bureau officials

before the Select Committee.

I, as you well know, have a long history in the field of law

enforcement. The State Bureau of Investigation, under my direction as

Attorney General of North Carolina, performed excellently as the State's

primary law enforcement agency.

It is my hope that the Federal Bureau

o1 Investigation can, in the near future, regain its status as a highly

respected law enforcement agency. This can only be accomplished by the

Bureau's free admission that, for whatever reason, it has placed itself

above the law in the past on occasions too numerous to mention and by

Its active willingness to work with the American people through their

elected representatives in Congress to bring to light and to correct those

abuses of the past.

The Domestic Subcommittee of the Select Committee, on which I serve,

is now in the process of completing its inquiry into past FBI activities

and preparing legislation and guidelines to govern future FBI activities.

If you feel that you can be of assistance to me in performing my duties on

the Subcommittee I will be glad to meet with you and discuss your ideas at

a time convenient to us both.

Sincerely yours,

Choles Morghn

94TH CONGRESS, 2ND SESSION

A single Committee member, however, is entitled

under Senate Rule. 35, to request a closed session of the

Senate in which he may disclose to the Senate any informa-

tion of any kind.

Hey disclose tho

He may. use a closed session to request

that the full Senate overrule

a Committee decision concern-

ling public disclosure.

Section 8 pertains to the Committee staff.

It

would limit staff employment to six years, and require a

Istaff employee to agree to be bound during and after em-

ployment by the rules of the Senate and other committees

with respect to the security of classified intormation. It

also would require an employee to receive an appropriate

security clearance.

Section 9 would require the Committee to formulate

rules to prevent

the disclosure of information which would

violate a person's constitutional rights or privacy.

This

requirement would not prevent the Committee from publicly

any infringement of the privacy

of any person.

Section 10 describes the procedures for the dis-

closure of information in the Committee's possession.

The

Committee could disclose any information if it determines the

national interest would be served by the disclosure.

In any case in which the Committee were to decide

to disclose any information which the President requested be

kept secret, the Committee would be required to notily the

President of its intention and it could not disclose the in-

formation for ten days.

If the President, prior to the dis-

closure, were to certify in

writing that

the disclosure would

threaten the national security,

and if the Committee were to

lecide to refer the question of disclosure to the Senate, the

information could not be disclosed unless the full Senate

were to agree to do so, or the Senate were to refer the matter

back to the Committee and the Committee thereafter were to

approve the disclosure.

94TH CONGRESS, 2ND SESSION

If the question of disclosure were to be referred

to the Senate. by the Committee, the Senate would be required

to. vote on the matter within three days.

Ultimate authority to decide what information should

be disclosed thus would rest with the Committee, except that,

as noted, a member of the Committee would have the right under

Senate Rule 35 to request a secret session of the full Senate

and to move that the full Senate overrule a decision of the

Committee.

Section 11 would authorize the Committee to permit

a personal representative of the President to serve as a

liaison to the Committee and to attend closed meetings.

Section 12 provides that all materials now in the

custody of the Senate Select Committee would be transterred

to the new Committee.

As mentioned above, Sections 4 through 12, if the

bill is enacted, could be amended by the Senate acting alone,

since these sections would be

enacted as an exercise in the

rulemaking power of the Senate.

Subsection 13(a) would impose upon the head of each

intelligence agency an affirmative duty to keep the Committee

"Iully and currently informed with respect to intelligence

¡activites" of his agency.

Subsection 13 (b) would make it the duty of the head

(of each intelligence agency "to furnish any information or

document in its possession, custody, or control, or witness

in its employ, whenever requested by the Committee:..

" with

respect to any matter within the Committee's jurisdiction.

This duty, if imposed, would give to the Committee,

its staff, or an agency working at the Committee's direction,

such

total, and complete access

as the General Accounting OfIice, unreserved, unlimited,

to FBI information and documents.

No mention is made, for example, of the head of the agency

having authority to withhold the identity of a confidential

source of information.

granted by this subsection, the proper interpretation of this

phrase is of no moment.

Subsection 11(c) would prohibit covert or clandes-

tine activities in toreign countries in peace time without

prior notice to the Committee.

Section 14 would require annual authorization for

appropriations for the intelligence activities of, among

others, the FBI,

"including all activities of the

Domestic

Intelligence Division (sic),"

or its successor.

• Perhaps a word is in order about what the bill

would not do. It would not create a joint House-Senate

Committee; it would not reduce the number of committees

having oversight jurisdiction over the FBI; it would not

establish penalties for unauthorized disclosure of informa-

tion; it would not require prior notice before engaging

in specific acts, although the authorization for appropria-

tion section (Section 14) could result in nearly the same

thing; and it would not apply to criminal intelligence unless

it were to be determined by the Attorney General of the

Director that criminals pose or are considered to pose a

threat to the security of the United States.

(Differentiating

between the various species of intelligence is beyond the

scope of this memorandum.)

What would the bill do?

It would create a new

standing committee of the Senate; it would add one to the

number of committees with some oversight jurisdiction over

the FBI; it would grant total access to FBI documents and

information - access unprecedented even during the investi-

gations by the Senate and House Select Committees; it would

give one Senate Committee the authority to disclose sensitive

to be utilized, all 100 Senators in most instances would

Therefore, if the Executive's fear of the harm

which could be caused by disclosure by the Senate - either

authorized or improper - outweighs the Executive's determina-

tion of the benefits to be gained from an intelligence acti-

vity, then in that case the bill will have created a one-

Dear Mir. Attorney General:

As a part of the Select Committee on Intelligence's pre-

paration of a final report on IBI donestic intelligence operations

we will be seeking to take the testimony of persons whose memorande

and statements might be quoted in that report.

In our investigation into the FBI's counterintelligence activities

against the Black Panther Party in Chicago certain Bureau memoranda

and Airtels may be quoted.

The following is a list of these documents.

Actual copies, received by the Select Committee from the FBI, are also

enclosed.

Memorandum SAC, Chicago to Director, FBI 12/16/68

Memorandum SAC, Chicago to Director,

FBI 1/13/69

Memorandum SAL, Chicago to Director, FBI 3/14/69

The Select Committee staff believes that Special Agents Joseph

Stanley, Joseph McCabe, and Roy Martin Mitchell were responsible for

these memoranda and we would appreciate your forwarding to us the names

of other FBI personnel responsible for their preparation. We would

also like you to make the necessary arrangements for Select Committee

staff to be able to interview these persons.

Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Yours very truly,

track
