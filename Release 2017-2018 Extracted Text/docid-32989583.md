MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

The telephone surveillance on the national head-

quarters of the Black Panther Party which was authorized on

February 4, 1969, has proved to be most valuable.

It has

provided information concerning the planned establishment of

Black Panther Party branches at Eugene, Oregon; Fresno,

California; the Watts area of Los Angeles, California;

Syracuse, New York; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Columbus,

Ohio! It provided information concerning the removal of

Joudan Ford from his leadership position in the New York City,

branch and, most recently, has furnished details concerning

the travel of National Chairman Bobby George Seale to the

Scandinavian countries where Seale is at the present time.

Live informants are furnishing information indicat-

ing that the organization will increasingly use underground

methods of operation which further emphasizes the desirability

of obtaining additional coverage to supplement data being

furnished by our live informants.

It is requested that authority be granted for

telephone surveillances on the Black Panther Party headquarters

at 4115 South Central Avenue, Los Angeles, and on the Black

Panther Party office at 2026 7th Avenue, New York City or on

any other places to which they may move.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

NEW YORK DIVISION

You have previously authorized this Bureau to

initiate and continue a telephone surveillance on the

office of the extremist Black Panther Party (BPP) in

Ne Xia cot contined to pro see sin Ascar data on

this group's plans and operations, and it is apparent

the BPP in New York City is second only to the national

headquarters in Berkeley, Californial from the standpoint

of generating plans for racial violence.

This Bureau has developed information that the

BPP in New York recently opened an office at 1370 Boston

Road, Bronx, New York! This office is known as the Black

Community Information Center and reportedly is to function

as the East Coast Information Center for the BPP: It is,

therefore, apparent that a telephone surveillance at this

location will provide access to invaluable data regarding

the BPP'S plans and activities, not only on a local level

In New York City, but on a national scale as well.

It is, therefore, requested that authority be

granted for a telephone surveillance at the above location.

The telephone, concerning which coverage is requested, is

listed in the name offRonald Morris, a known BPP member

in the New York areas!

Communist China and Cuba. The Young Lords has received

political education from and has embraced the basic program

The

New York Young Lords in December, 1969, seized

a neighborhood church and held it for ten days before being

evicted by police action. On March 5, 1970, an officer

INTERNAL SECURITY - YOUNG LORDS PARTY

Reference is made to this Bureau's memorandum dated

June 19, 1970, and approved by you on the same date wherein

you approved continuation of telephone surveillance at the

headquarters of theYLP in New York for a three-month period,

effective June 30, 1970.

It has been determined that telephone service at YLP

headquarters]has been terminated due to nonpayment of the

telephone bill. Accordingly, the coverage previously approved

by you is being discontinued, effective July 15, 1970.

The YLP continues to have telephone service at its

Bronx, New York, chapter which is also the center for publica-

tion of its revolutionary paper, "Palante." It would appear

that YLP activity in the New York area will now be centered at

the YLP office, Bronx, New York. Previous technical surveillance

coverage of YLP headquarters provided valuable intelligence data

regarding the organizational and the financial structure of the

YLP and also furnished information regarding the identities of at

least 15 new YLP members.

The YLP continues to advocate revolution and violence,

and recently applauded the actions of those Puerto Rican revolu-

tionaries who attempted to assassinate President Truman in 1950

and who wounded several individuals in a shooting spree within

the chambers of the U.

S. House of Representatives in 1954.

The monitoring of this surveillance will be conducted

in accordance

with the instructions contained in your letter

RE: REQUEST FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

I hereby request,

that you, on behalf of the

President of the United States, authorize a telephone surveil-

lance on the National Office of the Young Lords Party (YLP)

at 202 East 117th Street, New York City.

The YIP is a militant Puerto Rican youth group patterned

after the Black Panther Party.

In addition to several branches

in New York City, there

are YLP branches in Bridgeport,

Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Puerto Rico.

According to its 13-Point Program and Platform, the

YLP is a revolutionary political party fighting for the

liberation of all oppressed people, seeks self-determination

for Puerto Ricans' liberation, and believes armed self-defense

and armed struggle are the only means to liberation.

It cites

the Castro revolution in Cuba as an example of the right of the

people to destroy a government which oppresses them and of the

importance for all true revolutionaries to have definite plans.

Major confrontations with police authorities occurred

in New York City during 1969 and 1970 when armed YLP members

and sympathizers forcibly occupied a Harlem church for an

extended period.

During the current month agitational activity

Of YLP members and sympathizers precipitated serious civil

disturbances in New York City and Bridgeport, Connecticut.

One YLP leader, Rafael Viera, reportedly is an associate of

various suspects in the Capitol bombing investigation.

that conversations of Jackson/and other leading SNCE officials

MEMORANDJM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

It is felt a telephone surveillance at Jackson's

residence, 855 Ansterdam Avenue, New York City will provida

vital information in our efforts to effect a solution of

this murder case as well as information of intelligence

value regarding black extremist activities. It is anticipated

results of this telephone surveillance will be introduced

in court or that leads to evidence may be obtained; therefore,

this request is being made not only for the purpose of

obtaining intelligence information but also on the basis that

evidence may be obtained which will be used in court. In

line with instructions on page five of your referenced letter

the following information is set forth:

It is believed that Jackson and other individuals

having access to this location may become involved in

discussions which could lead to the solution of these murders.

At the present time we are conducting intelligence investigations

of Jackson and other leading members of SNCC.

On May 21, 1971, two New York City police officers

were shot from behind and killed by two unknown black male

assailants while returning to their car after responding to

a legitimate call in the Harlem section of New York City.

TwO

days prior to these mirders two other New York City police

officers were wounded by black assailants and a letter to The

New York Times said that the shooting was for revolutionary

justice for black people against "fascist pigs." Weapons of

the same caliber were used in both shooting ineidents which

may have been related. In this crime, with the type of motive

involved, telephone surveillances of selected persons are most

valuable and necessary since a remark during a conversation or.

a contact often results in leads to the solution of the crime

which would not otherwise be available. Jackson has been

selected as a person likely to lead to the solution of these

murders.

officers were shot from behind and killed by two

unknown black male assailants while returning to

the Harlem section of New York City. Iwo days prior

to these murders two other New York City police

officers were wounded by black assailants and a

letter to The New York Times said that the shooting

was for revolutionary. justice for black people

against "fascist pigs."

Weapons of the same caliber

were used in both shooting incidents which may have

been related. In this crime, with the type of motive

involved, telephone surveillances of selected persons

are most valuable and necessary since a remark during

a conversation or a contact often results in leads

to the solution of the crime which would not otherwise

be available, Bealfhas been selected as a person

likely to lead to the solution of these murders.

AL. FATAH

Over the past several years, Al Fatah, a leading Arab

terrorist organization with headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon, has

had continuing interest in Black Panther Party (BPP) activities

in the United States. Black Panther Party - Cleaver Faction

(BPP-CF) leader Eldridge Cleaver, upon meeting with Yasser Arafat,

Al Fatah leader, in 1969, vowed full support by the Panthers of

• Al Fatah activities. BPP-CF leaders from the United States and

Algeria have reportedly traveled to the Middle East for indoctri-

nation and tactical guerrilla

training. In April, 1972, informa-

tion was developed indicating that the BPP-CF is planning the

recruitment of trainees to travel to Algeria where they would be

instructed in sniper tactics. These terrorists would be specifi-

cally trained in use of ground fire to attack the Presidential

helicopter and would be utilized if the decision is made by BPP-CF

leadership to assassinate the President of the United States.

The BPP-CF was originated in February, 1971, following

a split between Huey P. Newton and Leroy Eldridge Cleaver, leaders

of the violence-oriented BPP. Cleaver is a fugitive from justice

living in self-imposed exile in Algiers, Algeria, from which

Location he controls the International Section of the BPP-CF.

Since its inception, the BPP-F, with national headquarters at

2026 Seventh Avenue, New York City, has advocated increased

disruption of and violence against existing order. It strongly

advocates urban guerrilla warfare in the United States.

Within

the past jear, individuals associated with the BPP-CE have been

directly linked to murders, skyjackings, assaults on police

officers, and armed robberies.

Its scope of operation, however,.

has been limited due to lack of financial resources.

Recently, information was received that Al Fatah is

now willing to support financially BPP-CF activities in the

United States including purchase of weapons and explosives. In

mid-August, 1972, an Al Fatah operative, at the direction of

Eldridge Cleaver, contacted BPP-CE member Charles Emile Pratt, who

resides at 19108 Northwood Avenue, Carson, California. According -

to the information, Pratt was to arrange for acquisition of weapons

and ammunition and to make underground contacts needed by. Al Fatah

for an operation in the United States similar to that which

occurred in May, 1972, at Lod Airport, Tel Aviv, Israel, in which

29 persons were killed as the result of an Arab-directed terrorist

attack. Pratt introduced the Al fatah operative to John William

Washington, a BPP-CF member, who then resided at 1136 West 93rd

and who now resides at 4844z Mascot

Al Fatah operative and traveled to the East to obtain arms and

weapons that were to be used in terrorist acts in the United States.

Although aborted, these acts were to occur simultaneous to and in

consort with the recent terrorist acts at the Olympic Games in

Munich, Germany.

Two confidential sources, who are knowledgeable

concerning Al Fatah activities in the United States, have furnished

additional information corroborative of the data set forth above.

The first source advised in March, 1972, that an Al Fatah leader

in Beirut indicated that Al Fatah has trained agents, not connected

with Al Fatah, based in the United States who are members of black

nationalist groups and who stand ready to carry out acts of

sabotage in behalf of Al Fatah. A second source confirmed that

Al Fatah, during 1972, has contacted members of the BPP in

California concerning plans for acts of terrorism in the

United States.

The disastrous events which occurred at the 1972 Olympic

Games and at lod Airport clearly demonstrate the foreign potential

and capability of Arab terrorist organizations. The utilization

by Al Fatah of BPP-CF members to assist in carrying out acts of

terrorism would closely parallel the tactics employed at Lod

Airport in Tel Aviv in which Japanese nationals were utilized by

Al Fatah to carry out a terrorist attack.

•Foreign intelligence information essential to the

security of the United States, which

information is necessary to

protect the Nation against actual or potential attack or any other

hostile action of a foreign power, may be reasonably expected to

be obtained trom a telephone surveillance on the residence of_

John William Washington, BPP-CF member in the Los Angeles area who

is acting as an agent of Al Fatah in the United States.

All sources who furnished the information in this matter

which is set forth above have furnished reliable information in

Panther Party may be evicted from its headquarters in the near

future and, if so, (Carter's/residence would undoubtedly be used,

at least temporarily, as a headquarters to conduct Los Angeles

Black Panther Party business.. As you are aware, the Black

Panther Party is a black extremist violence-prone organization.

The Los Angeles, California, chapter has been one of its most

active chapters.

A surveillance of Carter's) telephone would be a

valuable supplement to the telephone surveillance on Los Angeles

Black Fanther Party headquarters which you initially approved

on March 20, 1969, and renewed for a three-month period on

September 8, 1969. This coverage has provided invaluable

information

not available through other sources.

A surveillance on Carter's] telephone might furnish a

valuable insight into the current power struggle between factions

of the Los Angeles Black Panther Party in which the subject is

prominently involved. In view of her current position, [she]will

undoubtedly be contacted on matters of planning and policy. For

the same reason she]should be in contact with numerous individuals

who are actively engaged in Black Panther Party activities in

an underground capacity.

It is requested authority be granted for a surveillance

Information has now been developed that the chapter

is utilizing another location at 5321 Staunton, Number 257,

Los Angeles, particularly for night operations. According

• to

our sources, this location has become a hub of evening activity

with leaders congregating there. The location has also been the

starting and termination points of a key Los Angeles Bi under

ground figure when acquiring weapons. It is also being used as

an apparent clearing house for clandestine telephone calls.

This location is referred to as the BPP Day Care

Center! Typical of Panthers deceit and treachery, they reason

that with the child atmosphere the police would not recognize

it as a serious BPPloperation and would not take reprisal against

it if they did.

The Panther office at 2136 Last 113th Street/was gutted

by fire on February 6, 1971, making operational occupancy untenable

and repair or replacement indefinite. Telephone surveillance has

RE

WHITE PANTHER PARTY - YOUTA

INTERNATIONAL PARTIJ

INTERNAL SECURITY - ANARCHIST

Reference is made to your letter May 6, 1969,

concerning the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act

of 1968.

The White Panther Party is a self-described

revolutionary organization which is a strong support group

for the Black Panther Party, The Youth International Party,

which is also known as the lippies, was organized in early

1968 by militant activists Jerry Rubin and Abbott Hoîfman.

These two organizations recently formed a coalition and the

combination of the two groups indicates the development of

the organization as a leading revolutionary white group in

the United States.

The headquarters of this organization is

located at 1520 Hill Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan! Three

officers of the White Panther Party have been indicted for

the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in

Ann Arbor, Michigan, in September, 1968.

One of these indi-

viduals, Lawrence Plamondon, was a recent Bureau fugitive

and was apprehended on July 23, 1970. He is currently in

custody in lieu of $100,000 bond.

At the time of his arrest in an automobile by the

Michigan State Police, weapons and other incendiary devices

were found. Also found was numerous written material which

indicates Plamondon may have been using the same underground

apparatus which has been serving Weatherman and other New

leftist fugitives. Plamondon noted in this material that

conditions in this country must escalate to "revolutionary

Violence" where battles will not be on police level of law

and order but on war level which will force the calling out of

the Army. Plamondon refers to this new level of violence as

involving "bombs and sabotage." He further states that financial

problems are severe and that "they" are going to have to get into

"ripping off banks like our brothers in South America."

He also

suggested that the example of "the brothers in South America"

who kidnap American ambassadors to trade off for prisoners should

be followed.

Milton Taube, a White Panther Party national officer

was also arrested with Plamondon on July 23, 1970. Taube is

known to have been a contemporary and extremely close associate

of Hilliam Ayers, a Weatherman member who is currently a Bureau

fugitive. Taube, at the time of his arrest, was a resident at

White Panther Party/headquarters and has resided at this address

Jor several yearS.

Furthermore, all business transactions of

the White Panther

Party are transmitted through this address.

Investigation by this Bureau has indicated that only some half

dozen top leaders in the hite Panther Party are privy to

I sensitive Yhite Panther Party information. He have one live

informant who has access to some information in this organization:

A telephone surveillance on the headquarters of the

White Panther Party - Youth International Party is expected to

provide extremely valuable information concerning the whereabouts

of Weatherman fugitives as well as to the New leftists who are

currently being sought by local or Federal authorities. It can

-also be expected that intormation concerning possible violent

plans on the part of this organization. will be obtained.

It can be expected that any individuals who have access

to the White Panther Party headquarters may become subjects oï

either local or Federal criminal violations., It is also

anticipated, based on the above information, -that results of a

telephone surveillance at this address will be introduced as

evidence in court or that leads to evidence may be obtained;

therefore, this request is being made not only for the purpose

of obtaining intelligence-type infornation, but also on the

basis that evidence will be obtained that will be used in court.

It is believed that Genie Plamondon, the wife

of Lawrence Plamondon, and other individuals having access to

this address may become involved in violations of the Harboring

statute, the Antiriot Law, the Sabotage statute, the Kidnapping

statute, the Bank Robbery statute and Federal Bombing and Gun

Control statutes.

2. At the present time, we are conducting an

intelligence investigation on Genie Plamondon and other

leaders and members of the White Panther Party - Youth

the White

International Party? He have very little live security

coverage of her or other individuals she may be in contact

with.

As set forth previously in this memorandum,

[Genie Plamondon, a White Panther Party national officer,

would undoubtedly use the phone at 1520 Hill Street, Ann Arbor,

Hichigang It is anticipated that other individuals who are

members of this organization or who are New left terrorists

will use this phone.

The identities of the individuals who

may be in contact with Genie Plamondon] and other individuals

at this address are unknown at this time.

1. It can be expected that the interception on this

phone will furnish us plans of the White Panther Party - Youth

International Party7to engage in terrorist activities or to

violate Federal statutes as noted above.

I, therefore, recommend the installation of a telephone

surveillance on the headquarters of the White Panther Party -

Youth International Party located at 1520 Hill Street, Ann Arbor,

Michigan, for a period of 30 days.

If approved, you will be

advised when this installation has been made.

The African Liberation Day Coordinating Committee

(ALDCC) is an ad hoc black coalition which is in the process

of organizing an African Liberation Day demonstration in

Washington, D. C., on May 27, 1972. The purpose of the

demonstration is to protest United States involvement in

•South Africa and to show African-American solidarity with.

African liberation groups.

To carry out its objectives on a mass level, a

large protest demonstration is being planned as the logical

vehicle of expression. Broad-based local ALDCCs are being

set up in major United States cities, Toronto, Canada, and

in the Caribbean area. These committees are working with

the ALDCC headquarters in Washington, D. C., to spearhead

efforts to mobilize at

least 10,000 black people to come

together in Washington, D. C., оп May 27, 1972.

Corresponding

demonstrations are also being organized in San Francisco,

California; Toronto, Canada, and in the Caribbean area on

May 25 and 27, 1972.

Plans are being formulated in Washington, D. C., to

assemble at Meridian Hill Park, 16th and U Streets, N.W. The

• group will march to and conduct demonstrations at the Portuguese

Embassy, Rhodesian Information Center, South African Embassy,

the United States State Department, The White House, and finally,

address February 23, 1972, before a group of 200 people

at Howard University, Washington, D. C., he stated there

would be no change in this society without revolution and

that basic changes should be in political and economic

of 1971 and made contact with liberation army leaders. He

spent approximately 45 days among fighters under battle

conditions and was urged upon his

return to the United States

to mobilize "brothers and sisters" in demonstrations to protest

United States and Canadian involvement in Southern Africa.

Huey P. Newton is the leader of the Black Panther

Party and the March, 19/2, issue of a national publication

quotes Newton as saying, "Armed struggle is still my belief,

in Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can

take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black

the black

community.

It was organized by Bobby G.

• Seale, BPP Chairman,

and Huey P. Newton, Minister of Defense.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," has

regularly stated that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression

of the black people. Residents of the black community are urged

to arm themselves against the police, consistently referred to

as "pigs," who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had

an article by the then Minister of Education, George Murray.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves. The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom

everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use the gun. Kill

the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an

article introduced with the following statement: "We will not

dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

"The only way to make this racist U. S. government administer

The BPP headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

In carrying out the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the

repeatedly sought to become

side of labor, join picket lines and engage in disruptive

and sometimes violent tactics against industry recruiters on

college campuses.

For example, on February 18, 1970, several

thousand demonstrators protested the presence of General Electric

recruiters on the University of Michigan campus. (worker.

Student Alliance members were included in the leadership of

this demonstration which snowballed into city-wide violence

and extensive damage occurred to banks and police cars in

the areas.

This faction is currently very active in many of the

major demonstrations and student violence on college campuses.

It is making all-out efforts to assume leadership in the anti-

war movement and is in the forefront of organizations

maintaining steady agitation

to stop military, recruitment and

abolish the Reserve Officers' Training Corps:

During the current

academic year over five hundred campus demonstrations have

taken place. Over two thousand arrests have been made and there

have been forty-one cases of attempted arson and four cases

of bombing. Nearly two million dollars in damages have been

inflicted to college facilities.

Last sunmer vorker Student Alliance had a Summer

Work-In project designed to infiltrate industry and it has

made plans to rejuvenate this project this summer. Worker

Student Alliance leaders have repeatedly encouraged action against

industrial concerns, both off and on campus with General Electric

being the main target. New Left advocates are believed to be

responsible for the bombing of General Electric OffIces In

New York City on February 7, 8, 1970. On March 11, 1970,

powerful bombs also destroyed the offices of three major

corporations in New York City.

The leadership of worker Student Alliance is extremely

security conscious at this time.

Many of its leaders are

traveling throughout the United States, especially the South,

in an effort to promote the

aims of the group, as well as

directing agitation against universities and industry.
