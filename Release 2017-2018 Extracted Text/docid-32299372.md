WFO 105-52281

PEPRAXENTENZA BEBOHENTENLA

at the Patrick Henry Library:

8. APPROX 193= 114 CEDAR LANE, CLeRKA, Virginia. He is

32 years of age, was born in Havana, Cuba, and is married.

He attended the

Belen School, Havana, Cuba, from 1939 to

1949, and graduated a Doctor of Law from the University

was employed as an attorney with the firm of NUNEZ,

& MACHADO, Havana. From 1959 to 1960, he was in private

law practice.

From 1957 to 1960, he was also employed

as an assistant professor and then professor at the

Villanueva University School of Law, Havana, and from

1961 to 1963,

he was a professor at the School of Law

of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, Ponce,

Puerto Rico.

On 7-31-64, WF 1414-S (protect - reliable)

advised SAs MIKE G. ZINCK and BURGE that Dr. PEDRO ENTENZA

is the representative of JURE in the Washington, D. C.,

area, and as such was quite active, although not very

successful, during about April and May, 1964, in attempting

to gain sympathy and financial support for JURE. However,

since the failure of MANUEL RAY to make his much-publicized

entry into Cuba by May 20, 1964, ENTENZA has been much less

active.

The informant described ENTENZA as a good

representative of JURE in that his ideas coincide with

those set forth in JURE propaganda, which the informant

considers to be very socialistic.

On 7-31-64, WFCS RAMIRO LOYS (protect - reliable)

advised SAs ZINCK and BURGE the representative of the JUre

in the Washington, D. C., area is PEDRO ENTENZA, but that

since the failure of RAY to make good his

promise to be

in Cuba by May 20, 1964, there has been little interest or

activity concerning JURE.
