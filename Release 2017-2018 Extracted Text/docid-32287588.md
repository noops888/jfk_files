JOHN CAESAR GROSSI Or JACK LESLIE BOWEN

stated that he was not inclined at this time to say

anything further concerning the 1969 Nercury or of a

Caveman auto home or of anything else. He pointed out

that the same situation exists at this time as it did

when he was at the Montessa Detention Center in Albuquerque,

New Mexico, in tho middle part of May, 1970, when he received

a telephone call from some man who represented himself

as being an insurance agent and inguiring if he had

ever borrowed a Cavenan auto hone in Oregon and if be

knew its present whereabouts. He pointed out that he

told this man making the telephone inquiry the same thing

that applies now that anything concerning those matters

would have to ba taken up with his Attorney LAWRENCE

BUCHNILLER of Albuquerque, New Mexico, who had been

appointed to represent him in his conviction and case

handled there.

JACK LESLIE BOWEN, Who states his true pane is

JOHN CAESAR GROSSI, pointed out that from Novembor of

could be done or was done to alter his prosecution.
