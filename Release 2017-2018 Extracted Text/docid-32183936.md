On 3/22/64,

the informants ascertained that ELIZAREN

MORA had

now started giving out the current

"Party line" an

the

story regarding the LEE HARVEY OSWALD caRo,

She Indicated

that che

believed now that OSWALD was

• "an edd

* ba12" who

probably ras collaberating with JACK RUBY and the police

She claims that

Police Officer nIppies vas in RUBY's

a few nights prior to the shooting.

The informants noted that MORA

is now apparently

putting out of her mind the things that had previously worried

her and vas minimizing

her concern about VINcar LE when she

traveled with hin from

CUBA, end she hazily refers to

-her

attent to talk to LEE in Cuba "obout New Orleans,

Intormants mentioned that ELIZABELE MORA had gone

to washington, D. Coo sometime during that porsod because she

sure she was in lashington during the tane ADOLFO LOPEZ

MAMBOS was elected President of Mecico,

MORA 's mother corrected

her and then she became confused and sate it was ADOLTO RUIN

CORZINES.

According to the informants,

this became patently

wrong also and then she said she now renembered

that it wào

f2om something someone had unitten to her.

The informants recalled that MORA had gone

to

lashington, Chicago, and New

York shortly before she made her

application for Mexiean citizenship,

They did not know whether

she had gone to New Orleans
