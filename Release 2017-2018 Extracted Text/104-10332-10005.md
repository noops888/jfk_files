Subject: ARRB request re Fabian Escalant Font

1.

The following is a gist of my phone call Thursday

afternoon (30 November) with Gunn re his request to see

Escalant's file(s)*:

As requested by DO; I told Gunn that since we had been

unable to link Escalant with the JEK collection or

investigation the issue of relevance had been raised and

that he would not be able to see any files this week.

Gunn response: "This is an issue that they, (ARRB stäff)

seriously... if we (Agency] want a 'formal request

...:

would prepare one this afternoon...not a fishing

expedition

...information from a credible source in Johnson White

House.. (information] linked to 1964 and CIA...

I suggested that we discuss after he returned from the

Conference. He indicated agreement.

2. Gunn may change his mind and send over a formal

request anyway; he clearly plans to pursue this issue.

I

recommend we ask Gunn to be more specific in terms of

Escalant's relevance to the JFK assassination story,

timeframe and what he is looking for; this could be

done

either in a meeting with him or in a formal request. He has

mentioned in each of his conversations that the Agency may

not want this to be a formal written request, but is vague

on why.

3. See attached article for Escalant's current

activities re JFK Assassination story.

* [Gunn first raised the issue of Escalant several weeks ago;

last week he ask if it would be possible to view the file

prior to attending a conference on the JFK Assassination

that Escalant would also be attendingl.

.. SUMMARY:

.. TEXT:

(Station commentary: from the "Evening Information Review"

neuscast)

A group of investigarors. eight U.s.

and two Cuban, have just held a meeting in Rio de Janedro,

Brazil.

The group analyzed the polirical circumstances, direct causes, and

main responsibility for the assassination of U.S. President John F.

Fennedy in November 1963. It is Interesting to point out that 32

years afteri the Dallas assassination, well-tounded doubts continue

to Rrow over the official reports given at that time.

• • [ЕХТ:

A seminar enritled: JFK, The Truth Revealed was organized by the

Rio de Janeiro authorities In Iate August in that capital city.

During that seminar, Cuban and U.S. experts agreed to rule out

the theory of a sole killer, which is the main conclusion of the

report issued ty the Warren Commission.

The commission ans

appointed was by the ll.S. government to invesrigare the case.

. .ТЕХТ:

U.S. lawyer Wagne

Smith, forner chiet of the U.S. Interest Office

in Havana, said he was convinced ll.S. secrer services and Cuban

counterrovolutionary clements had plotted to murder President

Kennedy for not authorizing new aggressions arginst Cuba, atrer the

foiled 1961 mercenary invasion.

Wayne Smith

said that, after 30

years of studies and investigations

by specialists from non-

governmental U.S. organizations,

i had been established that

President Kennody had

rejected the plan of implementing new anti-

Cuben operation in 1963; the same year in which he vas shot to death.

in Dallas.

.. TEXT:

It is not furile to recall that during those days of

counterrevolutionary effervescence - sponsored, promoted, and

financed hy the government in Washington -- attempts were

made to

build a case against the Cuban government on charges chat ir vas

responsible for this crime.

The allegation was that the Cuban

government as retaliating for the Bahia de Cochinos action.

At

that rime, il was said that the Cuban government had hired several

U.5. Mafia criminals en carry nut the arrack.

There vas a gieat

deal of sperulation abour accused les larve; esuald's sissis

Mosco and Havana, there he allegedly trained for the Dallas

operation.

number of deaths.

accidental and clearly indicated that some one was trying to crase

clues.

.. TEXT:

•Division General Fabian Escalante, from the Cuban Interior

Ministry, represented Cuba at the seminar.

He based his thesis on

8has fact that the Cuban counterrevolucion had played a Lundamental

onle in the assassination.

Gen. Escalante presented

a well-

documented position to hack his theory and

was widely-praised by the

seminar's participants.

Ocher theories presented at this event

pointed to the collusion between the U.S. Contral Intelligence

Agency and che Cuban counterrevolurion sectors, mainly located in

Ine city of Miami.

.. TEXT:

Recently, several secret documents from the Warren Commission's

investigations were

revealed.

They are evidently intended to weaken

the strength of versions chat were closer to the truch. Another lor

n1. evidence, however, was left in the shadow.

It will most surely

be: revealed

when

the good

and bad people related to this historic

cpisode have died.

In the years that folloved his death, dictatorships intensified

in Latin American countries,

among them

Brazil and Chile, with

the

support of radical CIA sectors, and drus trafficking and arms

snuggling began lo operate in a new genpoiltical context, based on

porerful cartels.

This was a revard char the mafia was eagerly

annizing, atter the Criminal Union doclined on errablish its old

headquarters in Cuba, which had been strengthened in

the time of

Fulgencio Barista, Fidel Castro's predecessor. The reward for Cuban

exiles was the strengchening of the blockade against the Castro

regime, while the United States, which

was engaged in a strong arms

bualdup policy, extended the war in Viernam until 1973.
