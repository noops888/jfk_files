ANNUNZ1O, was a well-respected Italian businessman and leader

of several Italian civic groups.

Villa Scalabrint Old Peoples Hone and is Director of the Italian

Welfare League.

During the intervier ANNUNZIO expressed a

desire to cooperate fully with the interviewing Agents and

bemoaned the lact that the respectable Italian-American

professional and businessman is not in a position to force out

the old Ward politicians who are obviously backed by the Chicago

syndicate, namely JOHN D'ARCO and ANTIONY GIBOLAMI. D'ARCO

states in

the above conversation that ANNUNZIO was questioned

about GIROLANIÂ®s

ANNUNZIO initiated the conversation

pertaining to GIlLANI and expressly asked the question of the

Interviewing

in today?

I'll tell you why.

He- was tapped on the shoulder

and was hand picked by certain individuals."

He described

GIRDLAIT as probably the worst example to his knowledge of an

Italian-Anerican politician hand picked by the syndicate to

look after their affairs..

had ben interviewed by Bureau Agents and advised SA RODER

context of the interview 1s unknown; however, one possibility

is that he may be attempting to gain D'ARCO's confidence while

at the sane time cooperating with the Bureau Agents. ANNUNZIO

has been assigned symbol number CG 6514-PC as possible development

under the top echelon criminal informant progran. The conversation

then continues as follows:
