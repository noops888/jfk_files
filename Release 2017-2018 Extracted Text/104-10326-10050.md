SUCH ACTION COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES

RELATIONS AT A TIME WHEN A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT SECURITY

AND ECONOMIC ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED.

IT ALSO WOULD RISK REIGNITING

EARLIER CONTROVERSIES

PUBLIC CONFIRMATION WOULD, WITHOUT A DOUBT,

DISRUPT COOPERATION

_ON IMPORTANT

COUNTERTERRORIST AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CASES.

BY MAKING THE

JOBJECT OF GREATER PUBLIC AND POSSIBLY OFFICIAL SCRUTINY,

IT WOULD LOWER THE CONFIDENCE |

ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY AND SECURITY:

GOVERNMENT DOES

NOT PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT IT COLLECTS INTELLIGENCE, AND AS A COROLLARY,

DOES NOT ADMIT TO HAVING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE

AGENCIES.

AVOIDS PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT

IS. ANATHEMA TO THE LEFT WING OF THE

POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AND ANY ADMISSION WOULD GIVE THE LEFT NEW

OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK

WHICH WAS THE

RULING PARTY |

AND IS TODAY THE PARTY OF THE PRIME

MINISTER AND THE LEADING PARTY WITHIN THE RULING COALITION. ANY

CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE LARGELY RECEDED FROM THE HEADLINES. L

THE PRESS MADE A MAJOR ISSUE

_ IN ITS

FORMATIVE YEARS.

ANYTHING THAT LENT CREDIBILITY TO THE STORY WOULD

BE A SERIOUS POLITICAL LIABILITY

THEN FOREIGN MINISTER

I PERSONALLY ASKED AMBASSADOR

THAT

THE US GOVERNMENT NOT RELEASE DOCUMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT.

EXPLAINED TO AMBASSADORI

JCAN DEAL WITH RUMORS AND

EVEN UNCONFIRMED LEAKS, BUT OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION

WOULD BE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AFFAIR, THREATENING TU DAMAGE

SUCH A RUPTURE IN THE RELATIONSHIP

DEFIES EASY REPAIR.

THE SOUTH KOREAN AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

PLANNING, WHICH SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED JAPANESE LIAISON WHEN IT

KIDNAPPED OPPOSITION POLITICIAN KIM DAE JUNG FROM TOKYO OVER TWO

DECADES AGO, IS STILL TREATED AS A PARIAH TODAY.

7. IMPACT ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS: OUR ONGOING COOPERATION

IN PURSUIT OF A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL

TERRORIST GROUP COULD BE TOTALLY DISRUPTED BY DISCLOSURE. EXTREMELY

IMPORTANT US LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE EQUITIES ARE AT STAKE

IN THIS COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR.

THE TERRORIST GROUP IS PROBABLY NOT

AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF US INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR PURSUIT. DISCLOSURE
