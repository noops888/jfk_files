Ethat Orlando Bosch Avile, head of MIRR, indicated he has $3,000

about 5:30 p.ll. and land at dark at Marsh Harbour where it will

rendezvous with the snall plane. After loading, the two-engine

aircraft will leave at about 2:00 a.m. and proceed to the target

twin-engine aireraft for this operation which is still in the

planning stage. Bosch indicated he was going to send one Luis,

full name unknown, to Marsh Harbour this week for orientation

purposes. Luis was described as a white male, about 35 years of
