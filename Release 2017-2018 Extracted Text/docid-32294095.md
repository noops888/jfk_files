NOTE:

The extremely sensitive source referred to in instant

letter 1s MY 694-5%

Susan Frank and her husband, Richard, are suspected

of being agents for the Chinese Communists in the U. S., not

only by the Bureau but by CP, USA. It appears that Ilaison with

Chinese Communists is maintained through Israel Epstein and

TANG Ming-chao, who have headquarters in the office of a member

of British CP in London. If we can persuade British to intensify

coverage of individuals in London, possiblyy exists, we may

ultimately learn details re Chinese Communists activities in U.
