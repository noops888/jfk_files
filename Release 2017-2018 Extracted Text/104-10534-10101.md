Technical Analysis of Letter and Envelope -

DB CASE 44361

Wa/2 Mamo dated 13 December 1963

I. In response to referenced request, an original typewritten

letter and envelope addressed to the American Sabasay, Stockholm,

vere exanined in order to deternine the origin of the letter and the

nationality of the writer.

The following conclusions vere drawn concerning the letter

and envelope:

The typewriter In question 18 equipped with an obsolete

style of German-made type which, acoording to our references, was

fitted on a mmber of typewriter made in Germany during the 1920s

and early 19300.

The ponible makes would be Atoever, Torpedo,

Nercedes, Rheimetall, Urania, Orgs, Fortuna, Continental, Kappel,

roma, Irlumph, Mers and possibly sons others. Of there makes,

the Torpedo, Mercedes, Rhelmetall and Trlumph were probably the

most videly distributed.

b. The machine in question 1s equipped with a black and red

Strike -overs:

unlaut-u for hyphen and "y" for

charaotere are adjacent on the standard Swedish leyboard, but not

on the Germen.

The unlaut-s was not uned in the street address,

"Strandvagen" (where the dots should have been placed over the

second "a"). Thie might be either a simple overnight or an attempt

to conceal the uriter's fantllarity with the correct apolling.

c. ine paper of the letter 18 of the international standard

(DIN) B129 "A4" which 1s almost universally used In Sweden. The

Iinen-textured stationery seems to be rather eoumon in Breden.

The two smaller pieces of blank paper mutch the letter paper with

respect to width, thieknens, color, texture and look-through, and

were probably out from another sheet of the same type.

The envelope

matches specimans of Swedish envelopes taken fron DB/5-Postal.

Intelligence files.

The letter was posted from the Stockholm Ban post office,

which 1s located In the central railwy teratnal In Stockholm.

All mall deposited in street m1l borea in this area or in the post

office would be processed through this station.

The cancellation cachet on the envelope 1s identical in

all respects' (format, postmark, number style and lengtn of killer

bars) to exemplars available in our office.

f. The postage 1s correct for Swedish Internal mail and the

postage stamp 1a of current 1asue.

A possible Irregularity is the time lag betveen the internal

date of the letter, the date of the postmark and the date of receipt

In the American Embassy- The total time from the Internal date of

the letter to the time of receipt 1n eight days, the time between

the date of posting and the date of receipt is more than three days.

This transit time of more than three days for intre-city mail appears

Irregular when compared with the average tranait time of only two

three daye for arrival between Stockholm and the United States.

3. The text of the letter varrants sone comments because a number

of peculiarities were noted - aside fron pure spelling or typing errors -

which seem to indicate a Swedish writer. The following worde represent

either Swedish spelling or modification: "reserv",. "etablisbed", "mirded",

"Krustjer". Other examples of Swedish grammar and syntax would be:

"in Soviet" (Swedish form but not spelling),

4. Another sigalficant detall is the name given, "Ryo liang Yüan".

for Chinese.

but never in combination with "yo". "Ryo" In a Japanese spelling. In

the name given it 1e not known whether the Chinese or Western presen-

tation 1s uned, in other vorde, whether "Ryo" or "Jun" in mant to be

the surname. Among Chinese syllables which could be represented by the

Japanese "Ryo"' are lileo, Llang and Lung. Of these lung (TC:7893) and

Ilang (TC:2733) are uned as surnemes.

In sither case,

"Ryo" I8 hardly

a name by which a real Chinese would Identify himself.

5. In siminary, and based on the above information, 1t 18 concluded

that the letter mus trananitted via normal Swedlah postal charnele..

letter Is probably a "crank letter", most Itkely written by a Swede,

wing a Swedish-keyboard typewriter and Swedish stationery.
