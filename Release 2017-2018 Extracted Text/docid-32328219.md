On May 26, 1959, CV T-9 reported to SA THOMAS

J. O'HARA that he had visited ALEX SHONDOR BIRNS at his

home during the last several days and that BIRNS told

him about being involved in the affair at Miami,

in la he nia bei sat

Florida, where U. S. Customs Agents seized an airplane,

munitions and arrested DOMINICK BARTONE. DOMEN

CV T-9 reported that BIRNS told him he was

one of the key men in the deal and that if it had gone

off, he would have made a lot of money.

CV T-9 stated that while at BIRNS' residance

BIRNS telephoned someone in New York City whom he called

TONY and during the phone conversation from what was

said it was apparent that TONY was also involved in the

Florida affair.

This phone call was made after 9:30 PM.

BIRNS stated that he was not going to contact anyone

down in Florida.

He revealed to CV T-9 that on one of

the last nights that he, BIRNS, was in Florida he was

with two other men and the wife of one of them. They

decided to go look at the plane involved and stopped

to drop off the wife in question and have a few drinks

at their house. On the way out of the house it started

raining heavily so they did not go see the plane, but

returned to the house. BIRNS told CV T-9 that he was

lucky in this instance because undoubtedly the plane

was being watched at this time by U. S. Customs personnel.

CV T-9 stated he received the impression from what BIRNS

said that the two men with him were from Cuba. CV T-9

stated BIRNS told him that he is not returning. to

Florida until the heat is off.

By letter dated July 15, 1959, the Miami Office

advised as follows:

CV T-10 on May 15,

1959, advised SA LEMAN I.

This phone was connected on December

The files of CV T-10 reflect that this individual

is a retired clothing manufacturer from Serpentine,

Pennsylvania.

He previously had service

at I0 6-1348,

Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which was discon-

nected probably the latter part or 1957.
