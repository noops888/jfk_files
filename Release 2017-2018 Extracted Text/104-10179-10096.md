1. Ray did not return to Washington until carly morning on Friday,

12 May 1961. He called me at 0700 from the airport. He was unable

to fin a definita hour for ue lo got together due to the fact that he was

expecting as appointment with a person be did not name some tire

during the morning. He later called a number of timeo from the Hotel

Ambassador to advise mo that he otill had had no word on his appoint

ment.

At 1145, Mr. Botarcourt called to say that he was with Ray

and "Fugendo" (Rogalio Cloneros) and could we got together. I sug

gerted they drive out to se Clarendon Hotel Court on Wileon Boulevard

where I had taken a room for holding our meeting. They arrived in

Mr. Detancourt's car at approximately 1230 noon time and we first

went te the nearby Hogate Restaurant on Wilson Boulevard for luoch

before we gor down to the businens of the prospectus.

portunity to streas in a mout serious way the need for absolute secrecy

to the proper people at the earlies poadible simo a carefully thoughe-

out plan of action which would sat foria clearly the objectives - what

the projact hoped to achieve; a statement of the problem; the strength:

of the Castro regime following the ill-fatad Invasion; the status of the

underground and its morale and capabilitles; the extent of internal

support for and discontent with the regime, etc., esc.

4. I also spoko of the nood for describing the kind of activities

which the Ray organization planned to engage in and the asseto and

capabilities which they have or can acquire to do the job. The need fox

explaining the relationahip and coordinatior. of the plan with the Revolu-

tionary Council was discurned at some length.

5. I suggested that ho include in the plan an itemization of the kinde

of support which he would expoct un to supply immediately ae well as she

kind and quantity of eupport which would be required of un as the project

developed.

6. I also suggested that the plan Include their views on how U. S.

linioon and coordination could best be worked out; how funds would be

funneled into the project; what commo and other training would be to-

quired; whothar U.'S. "real estato" would be needed, etc.

J. Ray outlined some of his thoughts regarding hio proposed plan

of action. According to him it contemplates action in three broad flolde:

(a) Underground activity - principally sabotago . in the

urban areas.

(b) Gradual bulldup • largely through clandeetine Infiltra-

dions of small bodies of men - of guerrilla forces in mountala-

ons and defensible areno.

(e) A psychological waríaro campaiga within Guba and abroad

Aimed at discrediting Castro and at the same limo providing the

people of Cuba something to fight for.

Is la Ray's Intention to depend almoat entirely on maritime opera

done for the Infiltration of personnel and materiel into Cuba, He alo

rules out of hio plan the creation of another invalon army but does con-

template the training of groups of perhaps up to 150 men in other friendly

countries of South America (he mentioned Venesuela as a possibility)

and said he would oxplora the possibility of basing maritime operationa

in non-U. S. ports.

. Ray said some means, other than Swan laland, must be foun

lor reaching the Cuban population by radie broadeasts. Ho spoke o

the possibility of short wave broadcaste from Venezuela and utiliza-

llon of a commercial station in Miami which he understande can be

clearly heard in Cuba.

10. Ray spoke of the denircability of stimulating the organisation

of "Pro-True Cuban Revolutionary" student groups in many countries

of Latin Amosica (he said a succossful organization has been formed

da Puerto Rico) and of sending quallfied representatives to those Latin

American countries where there in Soviet diplomatic representation to

contaci student and labor groups and leaders in an effort to present to

them the true picture of the sorry state of students, workers, and

intellectuals in Castro's Cuba.

11. Ray la also Interested in the possibility of putting out a "Newe

Lotter" under MRP sponsorahip which would discuss various aspecte of

lhe Cubas picture and set forth plana for Cuba after the fall of Castro.

Ho thought nuch a newe letter could go a long way towarde correcting

mistaken Impressions among American university professors and in

other circles as to the true nature of the Castro regime. He pointed

to the recent letter from 63 Marvard profesuors which was recontly

published in the N. Y. Times ao a "horrible example" as to how mia-

Ilormed eves university professors are on present day Cuba.

1z.

When the diecussiona got around to the seed for conducting

operations as least "under the umbrella" of the Revolutionary Council,

and the need for obtaining Dr. Miro'a concurrence before the U. S.

would be able to support any operation, it was obvious that neitber

Ing. Ray nor Mr. Betancourt holde a high impression of the Council.

Both feel that there in a strong ponibility that the close public

identlication of the Council with the recent invasion may well have

discrodised lhe Council to such an extent that it commands no supposs

or respect misala Cuba.

Tor the unko of argument they were willing to concede that the

political adrantagon of maintaining the Council for the purpose ol forcing

unity of the various oxile groupe may well outwolgh ite other obvious

shortcominge, However, both fool, and Mr. Betancourt was quite

emphatic on thie point, that the Council as a body le not capable of

directing clandestino actiona againat Castro and as a matter of fact

is opposed to any further efforte at overthrowing Castro by sabotage

and other subversive actions since they are completely "sold" on

the theale that Castro can only bo ramoved by direct U.S. military

action and therefore a continuation of Cuban underground activities

can only result in needless and futile lone of life. In the factof this

attitude, Ray said he does not expect to receive much encouragement

for his plan from the Council, although he in fairly confident that

DI. Airo's approval can eventually be obtained.

Ms. Betancourt thought that a workable solution might be found

to thair problem if the Council would agree to concern iteolf exclusively

with (a) the current taok of undying the opposition, and (b) planning for

Ite future assumption of power as the provisional government. Under

this arrangement, oporations aimed at the downfall of Castro could be

entrusted to those leaders and groupe (auch sa the MRP, MRR, and

possibly the MDC) which have both the susets and the will to do the

Job. Mr. Ray thought that it might be feasible to create an operations

planning board or command among the groups with demonstrated asseta

and thus avoid unnecesary duplication and confusion and make possiblo

overall planning. It was obvioue, however, that he would prefer to ac:

autonomoualy in the execution of his program.

Mr. Ray was very critical of Artime and claimed he was in possession

of aufficient "Yacta" to convince him that Artime, in collusion with ele-

menta of the camps, were planning to eliminate tho MRP and it= leadere

from the picture, when the invasion succeeded. He said he "known"

that Artime was being financially supported by wealthy ex-Datiatianos

of the Miami area-

13, Ray hinted at various times that the MRP may at some polat

find itnell faced with the neconsity of withdrawing from the Council and

going it alone. He says that the Council in composed of "goud men" but

they have no assete or significant followinge and "have nothing to offer

the people of Cuba" and although the proclamation of the Council, an

finally drafted, was a good one the "progrenaive" aspecta of the proclam-

ation were forced on the Council by the Americans and do not represent

the true feelings of the majority of the Council membero: He said the.

that acceptance of the Council would be improved by adding to ita

membership two or three more people whose names would be signs.

'icant and meaningful to the Cuban people. He did not name any

specific candidates.

14. Mr. Ray lat me read a 13 or la page raport which he higho l

just received from the MRP coordinator in Cubal

which painted a dreasy picture of conditions in Cuba since the failure

of lhe Invasion; was critical of the inclusion of Eatiotianos and "nino.

bonitos" in the invasion force; conveyed the strong feeling that the

Cubane had baen betrayed by the Americans; and indicated that while

the MRP organisation was still pretty much intact physically, morale

was almost completaly shattered. Ms. Ray said he would provide me

a sanitized copy (there were some operational and personal details)

of the report for our information.

15. In view of this report from within Cuba, Mt. Ray said that

he will winh to defer aubmitting his plan for our consideration until

he is able to receive word from Cuba concerning the capabilities,

willingness and feasibility of carrying out some of the activities he

has in mind.

He said it la useless to submit a program of action li

the bunan elemente to carry it out are lacking or completoly demoral-

ired. He thought he might be able to present his prospoctus within

approximately ten day.

he said naturally he will not giva the people

Laside any indication that he has been discuesing a plan of action with

16. I urged Ray to consider submitting at least a preliminary and

admirtedly tentative proppectus at this time based on the aseumption

that his assats aro till intact and will be willing to cooperato in order.

that it may receive early consideration. However, he stuck to his

belief tnat this would not be practicable and reiterated the need for

prior evaluation of the strength and morale af his following, "

17. Ray asked concerning the detainees at McAlles, Texss, and

wondered if they have been selensed. He was told that as far as !

know they are still under detention.. He sald Mr. Goodwin had taken

their names and promised to loak into the master. Mr. Botancourt

sald he would check directly with Mr. Goodwin se their statua.

18. Jinvied Mir. Ray and/or Mr. Betancourt to call me over

the weekend in case either should want to diecuss the matter further.

I had the feeling that Mi. Betancourt was personally in favor of aub-

mitting now a plan covering "abort term" needs of their organisation

and it may be thas such a paper will be submitted afier ho has an

opportunity to talk with Mr. Ray in private.
