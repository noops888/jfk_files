NEGATE THIS POSSIBILITY, CASTRO WAS UNDERTAKING AN INTENSIVE

' PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO HIS TROOPS AND TO LIMIT

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY INTERNAL UPRISING.

3. FIDEL CASTRO ADMITTED TO "SOME DIFFÈRÉNCES". BETWEEN CUBA

AND THE SOVIET UNION, BUT EXPLAINED. THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD.

ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR A CONTROLLED RELEASE OF NEWS RELATIVE

TO SUCH DIFFERENCES AND THEREBY WIN SOME TIME.

4. CASTRO INDICATED THAT ONE OF THE AIMS OF THIS CONTROLLED •

RELEASE OF NEWS WAS TO LET THE IMPERIALISTS BELUEVE THAT THE

SOVIETS WERE TAKING THEIR TROOPS OUT OF CUBA AND DISMANTLING SOME

OF THEIR BASES.

•: 5i.. ACCORDING TO FIDEL CASTRO, DESPITE THE FACT THAT IN EARLY

NOVEMBER, THE BULK OF THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT WAS STILL UNDER SOVIET

CONTROL AND WOULD BE USED (BY THE SOVIETS?) IF NECESSARY, THE

MAIN PURPOSE OF KEEPING THE ARMS IN CUBA WAS TO RE-EXPORT THEM TO

THIRD COUNTRIES, WITHOUT THE SO:IET UNION APPEARING AS A

PARTICIPANT IN THIS ADDITIONAL ARMS EXPORT.
