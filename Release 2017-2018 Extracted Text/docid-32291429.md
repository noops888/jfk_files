SUBJECT:

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

DALLAS DIVISION

Re Bureau airtel to Albany, 4/22/63.

In connection with Bureau instructions it has been

ascertained that at the present time there are no specialized

police gambling schools being conducted within the Dallas

Division.

It is noted, however,

that close liaison is being

maintained by the Dallas Division with trustworthy law enforce-

ment officers concerning procedures employed by gamblers and

bookmakers and vernacular used by these subjects.;

Any perti-

nent information developed is immediately brought to the atten-

tion of agents assigned to the Criminal Intelligence Program

in the Dallas Divison for assistance in their investigations.

In connection with State laws regarding introduction

of microphone evidence in State trials, it has been determined

that there is no such law ener pro or con, concerning this

matter in Texas, according to local trustworthy police officers

and the local DA's office,

'Dallas..

These sources, however,

state that it is their belief that the introduction of such

evidence in local trials would be barred in view of recent

supreme court decisions and therefore, any evidence so obtained

is not even used in local trials.

presently before the Texas House of Representatives, a proposed

legislation introduced by a group of Texas attorneys which

would make wiretapping, by anyone, a violation and punishable

by imprisonment.
