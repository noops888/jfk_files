Dear Mike:

The Select Committee is considering the release

of a report on certain FBI activities conducted in San

Diego, California.

On March 4, 1976, Senator Walter Mondale

of the Committee met with an administrative aide to a member

of the San Diego City Council to discuss this matter.

Attached is a copy of a resolution adopted by the San Diego

City Council in January 1976 and addressed to the Select

Committee.

During this meeting, Senator Mondale agreed to

seek to obtain FBI clearance for release of appropriate

aceton to nator one

documents in connection with this report..

The Committee

believes the attached documents fall within this class..

Therefore, I am requesting that these documents

be cleared with appropriate excisions for the above purpose

within one week.

Additional materials may also be submitted

for clearance within a few days.

INFORMATIVE NOTE

Date

4/19/76

Attached "Greensboro Daily News,"

Greensboro, North Carolina, newspaper

article advises that U. S. Senator Robert

Morgan of North Carolina has publicly

identified George Dorseit of Greensboro

an FBI klan informant. (Dorsett was

previously identified by the "Greensboro

Daily News"

as an informant which disclosure

at that time was attributed to an unnamed

source on the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence (SSC) of which Senator Morgan

is a member. Dorsett was in fact a klai

informant from 1/59 to 10/70 and documents

delivered to the SSC, when compared with

each other, do identify Dorsett as an

informant. His informant status has not

been publicly acknowledged by the Bureau

or Dorsett.)

Senator Morgan also reportedly said

that the list of illegalities by the

Internal Revenue Service, Central Intelli-

gence Agency and the FBI was "frightening,

"morally reprehensible" and "shows a lack

of respect for law," all done in the name

of national security which "became the

catch-all for illegal activity."

GREFNSBORO DATTY NEWS

Greensboro, N. C.

BY JACK BETTS

Dally News Staff Wriler

Sen. Robert Morgan, D-N.C., has pub-

icly identified a Greensboro man as a

paid informant on the Ku Klux Klan for

the Federal Burcau of Investigation dur-

ing the EBl's campaign of infiltrating

left-and-right wing hate groups during

the later Sixties, •

In remarks prepared for delivery Sat-

unday nicht in Winstor-Cadeto, Morgan

* idenüified the man as

"the Rev. Mr.

'Dorsett" and said that at the same time

¡ Dorseit was on the l'BI payroll, he was

speaking in "a most inflammatory man-

ner" at Ku Klux Klan rallies in North

Carolina.

Morgan press aide Neil Hill said the

reference was to George Dorselt of

¿ Greensboro, a long time participant in

KKK affairs and the chaplain of the

state Klan.

Dorsett was identified by the Greens-

boro Daily News in December as the

FBI's principal contact in the state

KIK, but until now. his identity has not

been officially confirmed by Niorgan, the,

FBI or the Senate Intelligence Commit-

lee, of which Morgan is a member.

• In a speech prepared for delivery be-

fore an audience at Wake Forest Oniver-

sity's law Day observance, Morgan

detailed several instances of what he

called the federal government's "laws

"morally repr tensible" and "shows a

lack of respect for law.

He cited the break-ins of homes of •

Socialists Workers Party members by

the FBI without warrants, and of the re-

ported "organizing of Klaverns of the

Ku Klus Klan" in North Carolina in an

attempt to weaken the influence of exist:

ing Klan groups.

But, said Morgan, many were not

aware that "the Rev. Mr; Dorsett, who

was on the Fol payroll at the time,

spoke in a most inflammatory manner at

one of the largest Klan rallies in the

The Senator quoted Doisett as saying,

at a Raleigh Klan meeting in 1966,

"We

don't intend to have any vioience if we

have to kill every nigger in America."

Commented Morgan,

"For an FBI in-

formant to act in this way is most im-

moral. It sets race against race and is a

preiude to lawiessness."

He also cited the FBI's writing of an-

onymous letters to individuals "in an ef-

fort to break up their marriages."

In one such case,

he said, the FBI

wrote the wife of a Klansman that her

husband "had taken the flesh of another

unto himself," and in another letter to

the husband of a peace activist, wrote

that "your old lady doesn't get enough

at home or she wouldn't, be shucking

fand jiving with our black men."

Both letters, Morgan said, were "fa-

brications," and the FBI reported the

only "tangible result" was that the hus-

band and wife in one caee separated.

Said Morgan, "Apparentiy our FBI

has forgotten the maxim, 'What God has

joined together, let no man put assun-

i der."

• Morgan was critical of the FBI's ac-

tions in these cases, saying,

"All of this

immoral and illegal activity was carried

out with the excuse that it was in the in-

terest of national security. National se-

¡curity became the catch-all for illegal

But the Constitution, said Morgan,

'"gives no one, not even the president,

: the right to break the law....We must

make it clear that; everyone, from the

president to the snost common citizen,

i must obey the law, that no one is ex-

• empt for any reason. Only then can we

¡ be certain of preserving our freedom."

PURPOSE: To advise of the current review by the Intelligence

Division (INTD) of the revised Senate Select Committee

(SSC) draft of its report on our discontinued Counterintelligence Pro-

grams (Cointelpros).

SYNOPSIS: On 4/1/76, SSC made available the 133-page revised draft

of its report on our Cointelpros. Review of this report

determined the ssC has excluded two items requiring classification,

and report in revised form contains no information which could disclose

sensitive intelligence sources and rethods. SSC staff member Barbara

Banoff was advised 4/5/76 copy of its draft was unreadable as relates

to many citations to Bureau communications and that two names of

supervisory Special Agents should be deleted. She has advised names

would be deleted and in two or three days galley proofs of printed

report would be iurnished FBI Headquarters so citations could be

checked. Although considerably revised, drait continues to includo

most of criticisms in original drait reviewed by INTD representatives,

so no additional notice to the Department regarding our criticisms is

required.

• RECOMMENDATION: None. For information.

Memorandum to Mir. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Cointelpros

62-116009

DETAILS: At 4:30 p.m. on 4/1/76, Mr. Tom Dawson of the SEC staff

made available to the Analytical Research Unit a 133-page

revised drait of the Committee report entitled "Cointelpro: The FBI's

Covert Action Programs against American Citizens. " This report

was to be reviewed to determine if it contained information which

could jeopardize intelligence sources or methods. It is noted this

draft report originally was made available to FBI representatives for

review on 3/2-3/76. At this time the representatives noted two items

warranting classification and so advised the Committee. A statement

was also submitted to the Committee indicating further comment

would not be made because of the distorted nature of the report.

A careful review of this revised edition of the draft report

indicated the two items previously specified as requiring classification

had been excluded.

On 4/5/76 SSC staff member Barbara Banoff was advised

telephonically that the draft of the revised report was unreadable as

relates to many citations of documents. It was pointed out the FBI

was unable to check original information to determine if information

cited in the report could lead to sensitive areas in raw files. Banoff

advised she was unable to furnish a more readable copy of the report

but that upon completion of the FBI review for sources and methods

the report would go to the printer and thereaiter, in approximately

two to three days, galley proofs of the printed report would be fur-

nished FBI Headquarters so citations could be checked.

Banoff was advised that page 19 of the report sets forth

the name of former FBI Headquarters supervisor Russell Horner and

page 120 of the report identifies FBI Headquarters supervisor David

Ryan. Banoff stated she would take steps to insure these names were

excised from the report prior to it being furnished to the printer.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Cointelpros

62-116009

Although this revised drait report is considerably changed

and many editorialized comments and distortions have been deleted,

il is still replete with items taken out of context, distorted or set

forth in a manner to depict the Bureau in a most derogatory fashion.

Our criticisms, based on the review of the original drait report,

were forwarded to the Attorney General by letter dated 3/16/76.

Because these original criticisms stand, it is not believed additional

notice to the Department regarding this revised draft report is

warranted.

On 4/5/76 Miss Banoff was advised the review of the

revised report had been completed and no instances requiring exci-

sions of sources or methods material were located. She was told

the copy of the report could be picked up at any time by Committee

representatives.

By letter dated 7/22/75 the Attorney General re-

quested a description of all activities including but not limited'

to electronic surveillance or physical intrusion that might be

called into question or should be reviewed. The Attorney General

specifically requested a description of the types of such activities

now being conducted by the Bureau. In so requesting the Attorney

General noted he felt it was important that the entire Bureau be can-

vassed in order to discover any such activities that took place in the

past as well as currently taking place.

The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) by

letter dated 12/11/75 requested documents in the possession of the .

Department or the FBI relating to FBI practices which might be con-

sidered to be or have the appearance of being improper. In forwarding,

this request to the FBI, Mr. MichaelE. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel

for Intelligence Coordination, U. S. Department of Justice, forwarded

FBI documents sent to the Attorney General responsive to his letter

of 7/22/75. Mr. Shaheen requested that these documents be considered

• for transmittal to the SSC

in accordance with its request of 12/11/75.

On 2/23/76 Bureau representatives met with Mr. Shaheen

and Mr. Jack W. Fuller, Special Assistant to the Attorney General,

in order to establish guidelines for submitting documents to the SSC

responsive to the 12/11/75 request. Following these guidelines by

letter dated 3/2/76 we forwarded to the Attorney General a letter

enclosing for his approval and forwarding to the SSC the original of

a memorandum designed to satisfy its request of 12/11/75. Being

delivered with this letterhead memorandum were a number of Bl

documents which hacter felected birthp Attorney General for trans. /554

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 15

given access to these summarized documents in accordance with

an agreement between Senator Church and the Attorney General in

July of 1975.

Following a decision by the Attorney General that

these documents were to be made available to Senator Mondale for

his review Inspector Cregar met with the Senator on the morning of

3/9/76. At the outset of the meeting Senator Mondale advised Cregar

that he was not interested in seeing any documents that involved foreign

officials or persons other than United States citizens and permanent

resident aliens. He stated he was not interested in what investigative

tactics we employed against representatives of hostile foreign govern-

ments and that he did not choose to read any documents in Cregar's

possession which dealt exclusively with foreign nationals. Cregar

advised Mondale that the only document that did not deal with sources

and methods employed against foreign nationals was a letter to the

Attorney General dated 12/30/75 entitled, "National Caucus of Labor

Committee (NCLC), Internal Security."

Senator Mondale was allowed

to read this document in its entirety. After reading it he made the

observation that he did not feel this was an impropriety or an abuse,

but he requested a copy of it be furnished to the SSC.

This letter

on the NCIC, a copy of which is attached, discusses the fact that

the Bureau had developed a confidential source who owned the building

where the Ohio Regional Office of the NCLC is located. As landlord

of this building the source provided custodial duties among which was

the responsibility for removing trash discarded by the NCLC. The

letter further notes that the source voluntarily contacted Special Agents

of our Cleveland Office and made available for their review the contents

of the abandoned trash of the NCLC.

It is believed that with proper excisions we could provide

a copy of this memorandum, classified Confidential, to the SSC.

Senator Mondale asked Cregar if he could be assured

that the materials furnished to the SS'C by memorandum dated 3/2/76,

as well as the materials brought to the meeting by Cregar represented

Re:

all FBI practices which might be considered to be or have the

appearance of being improper against United States citizens or

permanent resident aliens.

Cregar advised Mondale that he could

not give him that 100% assurance;

that Mr. Kelley, responsive to

the Attorney General's letter of

7/22 furnished to the Attorney

General summaries of all activities that could be identified

that might be called into question. Cregar pointed out to

Mondale that these documents or these summaries were submitted

to the Attorney General under substantive captions and that

the Attorney General upon receipt of those summaries selected

the documents furnished to the SSC by FBI memorandum 3/2/76,

as well as those brought to the Cregar-Mondale meeting.

Senator Mondale stated to Cregar that he was satisfied

that the FBI had been responsive to the SSC, but that he had

several additional questions.

Mondale asked if the FBI continues

to employ incommunicado interviews at this time. Cregar advised

Mondale that we do not but should the opportunity present itself

in the future, we would only do it with specific approval of the

Attorney General. Mondale asked if during an incommunicado

interview had any person ever been hurt.

Cregar advised Mondale

that on one occasion a female Soviet illegal officer had taken

an overdose of barbiturates

resulting in her death following

interviews by the FBI.

Mondale was advised that in this instance

the victim was not under arrest; was living in her own apartment

alone and was not in any way under any type of physical surveil-

lance or control.

Mondale stated he did not feel that this was

an impropriety and was not interested in this individual as long

as he could be assured that the victim was not an American citizen.

He was so advised by Cregar.

(137-2528)

Memo, Baumgardner to Sullivan, 7/7/64, stated New York Office advised

that new book by Frank A. Capell entitled "The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe,"

which alleges that Attorney General Robert I. Kennedy had an intimate relationship

with iViss Monroe, would be ready for sale about 7/10/65.

Kennedy's Friendship with Miss Monroe "Well Known"

The New York Office has now furnished us with a copy of this 70-page

book. The book claims that Miss Monroe's involvement with Kennedy "was well

known to her friends and reporters in the Hollywood area," but was never

publicized. It is alleged that "there are person-to-person telephone calls, living

witnesses, tave recordings and certain writings to attest the closeness of their

¿friendship."

The author suggests that Miss Monroe "was led to believe his intentions

were serious," and that Kennedy had promised to divorce his wife and marry her.

When he failed to do so, the book charges, she "threatened to expose their

relationship, " which would have ruined his presidential aspirations. It was then

that Kennedy decided "to take drastic action. "

'Kennedy Had Communists "Murder" Miss Monroe

According to the book, Kennedy used "the Communist Conspiracy which

is expert in the scientific elimination of its enemies" to dispose of Miss Monroe

by making her murder appear to be a suicide. This could have been achieved

without great difficulty, the author points out, because her personal physician,

Dr. Hyman Engelberg, was a communist.

Re:

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Viost of the allegations made against Kennedy are contained in the

chapter entitled "The V.I.D." (pages 49-61) and on pages 69 and 70.

Allegation Previously Branded False

It should be noted that the allegation concerning the Attorney General and

Miss Monroe has been circulated in the past and has been branded as utterly false.

References to Director and FBI

There are several references in the book to the Director and/or the FBI.

A biographical sketch of Capell on page 3 states that, while associated with the

Westchester County, New York, Sherift's Ofice, "he supervised the investigation

of over five thousaid individuals and organizations, including Nazis, Fascists

¡and Comtaunists, on behalf of the F.B.I. in most vases.""

On page 49, it is stated that "under the direction of Bobby Kennedy the

F.B.I. has been frustrated as never before."

On page 59, it is said that Mr. Hoover does not share Kennedy's opinion

remain sicanto

that the Communist Party, USA, "is a windmill virtually powerless to harm the

United States."

On page 70, reference is made to an anonymous letter quoted in a column

Tof Walter Winchell datelined Viay 25, 1964, at Hollywood, California, which told

of a 23-year-old Beverly Hills blonde who had been "terrorized for months by the

same person who caused Marilyn Monroe's death.... You can check this with

F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Grapp in L.A..... Her initials are M.J." *

Our Los Angeles Office reported that "M.J." was Mary Lou Jones, a >

would-be actress of no talent, who is apparently mentally disturbed. Miss Jones

complained to

the Beverly Hills, California, Police Department that she was

being followed and harassed by unidentified men, but her allegations were completely

unsubstantiated by the police.

Dr. Hyman Engelberg Former Security Index Subject

Dr. Hyman Engelberg was the subject of a Security Matter-C investigation,

but his Security Index card was canceled in 1953 after his cooperative interview

with Agents of our Los Angeles Office. At that time Dr. Engelberg admitted

membership in the Communist Party from about 1939 to 1948.

CapeH Former Criminal Informant of New York Office

Capell ima former criminal informant of the New. York Office who was

discontinued in 1962 at his own request, since he expressed the belief that his

relationship with the Bureau. He Is editor of "The Herald of Freedom, " Post

Office Box 333, Staten Island, New York

which is an anticommunist newsletter of

an expose type.

Capell has been irterviewed in recent months by Agents of our New York

Office regarding numerous charges he leveled against a number of prominent

individuals. some of Capell's allegations are from public sources and are apparently

true, some are completely without foundation, and others are extremely dubious

alleged sources to our Agents.

Attorney General Advised of Capell's Forthcoming Book

By letter dated 7/7/64, we advised the Attorney General of the nature of

Capell's forthcoming bock, as well as background data on Capell set forth in the

preceding paragraph, although no mention was made that he was a former

criminal informant.

That the attached letter be sent to the Attorney General enclosing a

copy of the aforementioned book.

Reference SSC request dated 2/18/76.

The SSC requested to interview Special Agents - -

Joseph Stanley, Joseph McCabe, and Roy Martin Mitchell re-

garding investigation of the Black Panther Party in Chicago.

The SSC was furnished the following documents:

memorandum

SAC, Chicago to Director, HBL,

12/18/68; memorandum SAC,

Chicago to Director, FBI,. 1/13/69; memorandum SAC, Chicago

to Director, FBI,. 3/4/69.

The SSC requested interview with

these three Agents, and also the names of other FBI personnel

responsible for the preparation of the above-mentioned docu-

ments.

Inasmuch as these three Agents are currently involved

in civil litigation with the Black Panther Party in Chicago,

the Department has determined the SSC would not be allowed

to interview these Agents at this time.

The Department has

offered to furnish transcripts of the testimony of these

Agents to the SSC as it is available.

Contact with Steven K. Blackhurst, Assistant Special

Counsel for Intelligence Activities, U. S. Department of

Justice, indicates that he is of the opinion that SSC should

not be furnished with any additional names of Bureau Agents

involved in the investigation of the Black Panther Party in

Chicago. This matter is currently being litigated in a civil

trial in Chicago, Illinois.

Memorandum to Mr. T.W. Leavitt

Re: Senate Select Committee (SSC)

DETAILS:

On the morning of 3/30/76 Messrs Paul V. Daly, Robert L.

Shackelford and William O. Cregar met with Departmental officials in

the office of Douglas Marvin, Counsel to the Attorney General, to discuss

the so-called final draft of the Senate Select Committee. Joining Marvin

were Michael Shaheen, Jack Fuller, William Funk and Allen Kornblum.

At the outset of the meeting Departmental officials stated they

do not desire we redraft the report for the Committee nor correct obvious

errors of fact in the report. In addition, Mr. Fuller voiced the opinion

that no matter what the Bureau or the Department suggests to correct the

report, the Staff of the Senate Select Committee will pretty much do what

they want, implying that the minds of the Staff regarding the report have

already been made up.

In addition, Fuller noted that in his opinion certain

recommendations contained in the report reflected the personal opinions of

Mark Gitenstein, John Elliff, and Mike Epstein, all Staff members of the

Senate Select Committee.

With that the Departmental and Bureau representatives

reviewed the recommendations set out in the draft received by the Bureau

at approximately 4 p.m., on the evening of 3/29/76.

Attached is a copy of a work paper prepared on 3/29/76 for

the Director's information. The issues raised by Bureau representatives

with Departmental officials are identified in this work paper. In the

absence of specific comments, Departmental officials took the position that-

they agreed with the Bureau's concern'but noted that probably nothing could

Ibe done to change the substance of the Staff's paper.

Specific comments of Departmental officials are set out

below keyed to the Arabic number of the issues raised in the attached workpaper.

3. It appears the foreign intelligence agencies, i.e., CIA

and NSA are precluded from conducting investigation in the United States

against foreigners. Douglas Marvin was not sure that these agencies are

precluded and hoped to clarify that during a meeting he, Mr. Fuller and

Mr. Funk expected to have with Senate Staff people during the afternoon of

3/30/76.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senate Select Committee (SSC)

4. Departmental officials interpose no objection to

the Director of Central Intelligence having authority over the intelligence

community to mandate physical, document and personnel security.

7. This appeared to preclude NSA from exploiting

clandestine transmissions within the United States between foreign

establishments and their agents. Mr. Funk expressed the opinion that

this as onto a coat the verment sued, theretore co are

exploited by NSA. (5)

8. The final draft of the Senate Select Committee

reviewed py bureau oificials now allows for the use of military

personnel as double agents against hostile foreign officials in the

United States. (5)

11. This relates to Number 3 and it would appear that

Departmental officials will get clarification from the Staff of the

Senate Select Committee as to what, if any, domestic activities CIA,

NSA and the military can engage in.

12. The Department concurred with the opinion of

Bureau representatives that the recommendations distort or mis-

interpret Terry v. Ohio (The Stop and Frisk Standard). They stated

they would prefer to let the recommendations stand as they are with

the error in them as this reflects substantially on the credibility of

the recommendations.

as

16. Department officials were/concerned as Bureau

representatives regarding the sealing and purging procedure noting

this included destruction of indices. Departmental officials intended

to seek clarification from the Staff as to whether indices could be

retained should it be necessary to locate and unseal materials collected

by the FBI.

18. The Departmental officials were adamant that underlying

or texas should not be made available to Congressional committees

T&R SECRET

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senate Select Committee (SSC)

21. There were mixed feelings regarding the establishment

of a general counsel and whether or not it politicized the FBI. The

consensus was that much study will have to be done on this particular subject.

22. Douglas Marvin and Jack Fuller both stated that the

selection by the Attorney General of Assistant Directors was not a desirable

procedure and Marvin was not even aware that present procedures allow

for the designation of Assistant Directors of the FBI by the Attorney General.

The general consensus among Departmental officials was that although the

Attorney General had to approve the selection of Assistant Directors, such

selection would probably remain with the discretion of the Director.

23. Departmental officials shared Bureau concern over the

concept of annual statutory authorization for domestic intelligence programs.

They pointed out that based on their contacts with Staff people, the Staff

seemed to envision an annual review and possible complete change of

direction of these investigations on a yearly basis as. the Congress at that

time perceives the threat to domestic security.

Departmental officials also hope to clarify with the Senate

Select Committee Staff as to whether programs to collect cryptographic

material against foreign establishments (Anagram) is provided for in the

final draft.

(V)

The meeting concluded with the observation that very few

of therecommendations will ever be incorporated into possible statutes.

Mr. Funk voiced the opinion that probably a charter for 'NSA and for the

FBI to engage in foreign counterintelligence investigations would result

from these recommendations, however, he expected little more, if anything,

to be written into new statutes. Prior to the meeting breaking up,

Mr. Marvin indicated to Bureau representatives that he would orally

furnish the results of his meeting with the Staff of the Senate Select Committee

scheduled for the afternoon of 3/30/76.

OVERVIEW

1. Permissible areas of activity of the FBI in the

domestic security field are limited to

a. Terrorism

V. Hostile foreign intelligence activity

c. Domestic violence and rioting

The scope of investigations permitted is limited.

to those imminent violations of Fuderal law related to the

above three areas.

Imminence is defined as "soon to be engaged

in."

V.s.

2. The absence of specific language to allow, foreign

intelligence agencies, i.e., NSA, CIA, and the military to

• engage in intelligence collection activities in the U.s.

creates a void, in the overall intelligence product required by

the policy-maker. This void cannot be filled by the FBI due

to the lack of statutory authority as well as the capability to

collect positive foreign intelligence in this highly specialized

field.

3. Recommendations recognize the use of "specialized

techniques" but require "probable cause" standards for their

use. We believe the establishment of probable cause would be

most difficult if not impossible in many of these areas covered

by the recommendations.

Provisions of the recommendations dealing with •

sealing and purging of investigative results and cases resulting

from preventive criminal intelligence investigations would

probably preclude FBI from recovering information on individuals

who subsequently become the subject of a name check or other

inquiry due to newly developed information. Investigators

could

not accumulate incriminating information and each item

of information would stand alone.

5. Recommendations require excessive oversight. calling

for full access to the files by the Department of Justice,

the Congress, and the General Accounting Office. This would

inevitably result in the compromise of the integrity of our

files and breach the confidential relationship we enjoy with

our sources.

6. The recommendations originating in the Congress provide

in-depth oversight to an extent probably not Constitutionally

provided and are: probably in excess of the generally recognized

separation of powers among the three branches of Government.

T. There are provisions in the recommendations which

could lead to the political abuse of the FBI. Appointments

of Assistant Directors by the Attorney General would have severe

impact on the Bureau from a career development and professional

From a practical standpoint in foreign counterintelli-

10. Pg. 22, V, I. The following sentence is a

direct quote from Senate recommendations.

"All domestic

security activities of the Federal Government should be

under the authority, supervision, and control of the

Attorney General."

This may refer to administrative supervision,

but, in the overall context, it is clearly the tenor of

the recommendations to put the Attorney General (Department)

into a direct operational supervisory posture. Attorney

General Levi has specifically stated he does not wish to

operate in this manner.

11. Pg. 23, 2. This provision centralizes

all domestic security investigation activity within the FBI.

Does this, in fact, pRemote other agencies of the

intelligence community, such as CIA, NSA and the military

intelligence departments? If so, the FBI would have to

substantially increase its manpower and other resources

with a concomitant increase in budget authorization.

12. Pg. 26, 2.

The recommendations acknowledge

a need for investigations prior to an actual violation of

Federal statute. In describing what they term "preventive

criminal intelligence investigations," they would authorize

investigation where there is a "reasonable suspicion" to

believe that a person intends to soon engage in some sort

of terrorist or hostile foreign intelligence-directed

ictivity. The problem here is that while lerry Y: Oni‹

(the stop and frisk standard) they immediately attempt to

narrow the meaning of that decision by putting it in a

more imninent category by use of the word soon. A contact

case, for example, involving a hostile foreign establishment

would be virtually impossible to meet the standard of

"intent" and "soon." The same problem would apply in

virtually all of our security work.

troops for enforcement of Federal law or Federal court order.

Thereby, the FBI would not be. in a position to advise the

Attorney General of the imminence of such violence and

rioting. This is more restrictive than the Attorney General's

guidelines which cover the provision of obtaining advanced

• intelligence, as well as covers FBI activity in connection

with demonstrations.

14. Pg. 32. (4).. This provision required the

establishment of probable cause to believe that the place

SEARCHED

to be reocked (surreptitious entry) "contains evidence of

a crime."

This provision does not provide for the

• acquisition of espionage paraphernalia, i.e., shortwave

radio, secret writing equipment, etc., which in and of

itself is not evidence of a crime.

• 15. Pg• 33, (1). This restricts the use of

informants to identify a perpetratorsof the act (illegal)

and collection of evidence.

In other-words, informants

may not be used until after a crime is committed.

Do. the sealing and purging procedures allow for

"the retention in FBI indices of references to the sealed or

purged materials? If not, there is no way that the FBI can

recover information on individuals who subsequently become the

subject of a name check or inquiry due to newly developed infor-

mation. This would also mean that as investigators we would

be denied the ability to accumulate incriminating information

and each bit of material received would have to stand on its

own as to whether a violation of Federal statute existed. This

is totally contrary to practical concepts of conducting investi-

This calls for termina ion of "preventive criminal

year except with a 'written finding of 'compelling circumstances.'"

This is excessive language and while the Attorney General's

guidelines call for review and approval after one year of a

continued investigation, the tenor of the recommendation is

far more severe and impractical by use of the language "compelling

circumstances."

the Inspection Division to the IS-1 Section, INTD; and the

consolidation into IS-1 of all classification reviews in

Freedom of Information Act matters, including the addition of

several supervisors and support personnel.

The physical location

of these people can best be effected by utilizing Room 4063,

consisting of approximately 700 usable square feet, presently

site of SENSTUDY 75 Project. In order to accommodate the

above,

It is necessary to relocate SENStudy 75, the needs of which

for approximately the next six to eight months will be:

A room (or contiguous rooms) of approximately 500 to

600 square feet which will accommodate four to five people,

with desks for each; approximately 15 file cabinets; and a work

table approximately

5'X:3' plus two or three smaller

ones.

This space need not be in INTD. This space and personnel will

be used for a'wrap-up' project relating to SENSTUDY 75,

once our current work is completed, and will entail the

integration of files and indiges and a number of other record-

Dear Mike:

It has recently been reported in the press that

there was an FBI wiretap on Mr. Robert Amory under the

Kennedy administration.

The Select Committee requests

delivery of materials

pertaining to the authorization

and purpose of this wiretap, according to the terms

agreed upon in my conversation today with Mr. Blackhurst

of your office.

The Committee also requests delivery of a

chart pertaining to FBI electronic surveillances which

to have been delivered to the Committee on October 23,

1975.

Finally, the Select Committee finds that it does

not have copies

of the authorizing materials pertaining

to the electronic surveillance of the Jewish Defense

League which was declared unconstitutional in the Zwebon

case.

Therefore the Committee requests appropriate

materials pertaining to such authorizations.

Sincerely,

John T. Elliff

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise Senate

Select Committee (SSC) staff member James Dick had exhibited one

document from Bureau files concerning Reverend Ralph Abernathy of

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

DETAILS:

By memorandum dated 1-29-76 you were advised that an

inquiry had been made of John Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director,

SSC, concerning the possibility Bureau documents had been shown to

Reverend Abernathy. Elliff, at that time, had been unable to ascertain"

whether this had been done. Subsequently, on 3-17-76 Elliff advised

SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that James Dick, a staff member, of A

captionedi committee had exhibited one document to Reverend Abernathy

in conducting committee business. Elliff described the actions of Dick

as being an approved committee investigative activity and insofar as

he could determine the document in question was a letter from the Bureau

to former Vice President Spiro Agnew.

It appears that there is no basis for a protest concerning

this particular matter and that no further action is warranted.

Memoranda are then prepared concerning these reviews. Deputy Assistant

Director Homer A. Boynton held a conference on 3-2-76 with representatives

of this Division and the Intelligence Division in an effort to determine possible

steps to be taken to respond to publicity either before or at the time of the

Report's release.

It is felt that, in view of the recommendations being made by

Bureau Supervisors at the time of review, and since the draft will be rewritten

many times before publication, it would be premature to prepare a public

statement at this time.

TREC-100

4211115913

External Affairs will continue to review the memoranda

50529

prepared by the Intelligence Division to exise material that we might utilize

in preparing a statement at the time of the Report's release..

Attached is a memorandum from the Attorney General

to the Director dated March 15, 1976, captioned "File

Destruction Program."

The Attorney General's memorandum, in

part, states "Before the program actually resumes the Depart-

ment

will have to contact Congresswoman Abzug, who has requested

of me that no files be destroyed." Since the

aforementioned quote

appears not to be consistent with our prior understanding

depariment on this matter, Jack fuller, special Assistant the

Attorney General, was contacted on 3/18/76 and he was asked whethef

the Department

was implying they would solicit the approval of

FIT

Chairwoman Bella S. Abzug prior to the resumption of the file

destruction program. Fuller said that this was not the case

and they were merely going to give Chairwoman Abzug notice

the decision to resume the program

The notice would be given

in a fashion to apprise her that this resumption had been

approved by Senators Church, Scott

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

LASS I

GINERAL:

SEE 11600 BY PEALM Pe

In responding generally to questions and criticisn

regarding the FBI's investigation of king, it should be noted

that our investigation should be viewed in context of the time

involved--the early and mid 1960's--not today.

those were years

of considerable cacial strife throughout the nation when sub-

versive and other disruptive elements were attempting to

capitalize for their advantage on the social awakening in our

country on the civil rights issue.

Media, congressional and public criticism of our

investigation of King have occurred in the following major

areas:

ALLEGATIONS:

ALLEGATION: The FBI had no valid basis for

investigating King.

RESPONSE: This is not true.

The FBI had a

valid basis for Investigating King to determine the extent

of communist influence being exerted upon him.

However, for

reasons of national security and ongoing investigations, the

FBI is unable to provide any specifics.

It can also be pointed

out that this communist influence was of concem not only to

the FBl, buc also the fresident and Attorney General ot the

United States who spoke personally with King concerning the

matter.

It should be noted that the bona fide civil rights

activities of King were never under FBI investigation.

(2) ALLEGATION: That the FBI conducted illegal

electronic surveillances of King.

RESPONSE: This is not true. All electronic

surveillances of King were legal.

(3) ALLEGATION: The FBI mailed an anonymous tape

and letter to King. According to interpretation by various

individuals in the media and the Senate Intelligence Committee,

contents of this letter suggested King commit suicide.

ENCLOSURE

HH 55169 DocId: 32989589 Page 161

---

## Page 162

-

RESPONSE: There is no record in the official

fBl files to verify that any mailing of anonymous letter or

tape recording to King was an official FBI action or with FBI

approval. As to the suggestion that the letter sent to King

urged his suicide, we can find no basis for any conclusion

that the anonymous letter urged King's suicide and we do not

know what the letter urged. All we do know is that the draft,

or original of what might have been the letter was found in

papers left at the FBI by William C. Sullivan, former Assistant

to the Director.

(4)

ALLEGATION: The Fbi played tapes of monitored

King conversations to persons outside the FBI.

RESPONSE: There is nothing in the files of the

FBI to substantiate such an allegation.

(5) ALIEGATION: Information developed during our

Investigation of King was disseminated outside the Executive

Branch of Government.

RESPONSE: This is true.

Although our primary

dissemination regarding King was made within the Executive Branch,

there was some limited disseminations to other U. S. Government

elements such as Congressmen.

In several instances, on a highly

selective basis, dissemination was made outside the Federal

Government to leaders in religious, academic and news media fields.

"Dissemination did not include playing of any tapes.

(6)

ALLEGATION: The FBI conducted a campaign to

discredit and neutralize King.

King initiated actions, including several under our Counter-

intelligence Prograns, to neutralize and discredit King.

was no statutory basis for such actions. As to the possible

notive for the activity, because of reasons of privacy anc

and disce die pose bree

delicacy, possible motive is not proper subject for public

(7) ALLEGATION: That the FBI was in some way in-

volved in the assassination of King.

RESPONSE: False. There is no evidence to

support such an allegation.

This memorandum reports the review by supervisors

Homer Newman, Jr., and Edward P. Grigalus of the Senate

Select Committee (SSC) draft of the use of informants in

domestic intelligence investigations.

The above Supervisors were instructed to review

the draft on informants which report had to be read in the

SSC space and that no notes describing the content of the

report could be taken.

On 2/19/76 the report was reviewed by Supervisors

Newman and Grigalus which report amounted to approximately

70 pages. Thisreport set forth in some detail information

taken from the Manual of Instructions as it pertains, to

security and extremist informants.

This report discussed

policy and constitutional issues raised by the use of intelli-

Party, and Women's Liberation Movement (1969). All of

the above organizations were the subject of prior

inquiry by the SSc.

The report also discussed several informant

programs. such as the Ghetto, Plant and the American

Legion Contact Program.

It discussed the use of informers

at colleges and universities and the size, scope and

standards of the intelligence informer programs.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SSC:

This draft, as reviewed, did not contain any

recommendations of the SSC:

ISSUES:

There were no issues surfaced by this draft

report which had not been aired previously.

OBSERVATIONS:

In fairness, whenever the SSC draft report

set out intormation, which was criticar or derogatory

of the Bureau, there was also set out the Bureau's position

as a rule: However, in several instances, the above

Supervisors took issue with various parts of the report.

• It was noted that the word political was used extensively

which was brought totheir attention, specifically advising

them that the Bureau never conducted political investi-

gations.

In another instance it was pointed out to the

SSC that a passage appeared in this rough draft to the

effect that "it was understood that Rowe would have to

be involved in Klan violence." It was explained that

there was no such understanding on the part of the Bureau

and it was agreed that this would be changed.

RE: SENSTUDY ' 75

62-116395

In regard to informants signing written reports,

the draft erroneously indicated that extremist informants

were only required to sign reports where possible prose-

cution was involved. This was inaccurate and the SSC

agreed to change this passage.

There were two instances noted wherein informa-

tion was taken from classified documents. Both of these

instances have been made the subject matter of a commun-

ication back to the Committee through the Department

of Justice dated 2/26/76.

Staff Investigator Robert Kelley was advised

of the above and requested to make changes so that the

information set out above would be accurate of the Bureau's

position.

It is noted that this draft report contained

no conclusions or recommendations on the part of the SSC.

ACTION:

None. For information. No press response is

required at this time since the report contained no

conclusions.

2.

During 1952 the FBI was continuing to

seek a definite answer from the Department as to whether

during an emergency the program utilized in the Department's

portfolio or the Emergency Detention Act (EDA) would be

followed. The FBI did not commit itself to one or the

other programsbut did indicate that if the Departmental

program was to be followed, a positive statement to that

effect be received from the Department.

was

The FBI, therefore,

attempting

to receive guidance concerning a Departmental

program, and not one of the FBI's, which concerned apprehension

of individuals during emergency conditions.

An index was maintained as an administrative

subversive elements. Since the individuals maintained

this index were not scheduled for any apprehension or

detention and the list was used strictly as an administrative

aid it was not necessary to advise the Department of the.

existence of such an index.

Results of the investigations

of the individuals on this index, however, were furnished the

Department so the Department could be aware of their activities.

Memorandum to Mr. I. W. Leavitt

Re:

Senstudy 75

DETAILS:

The SSC, during its investigation of the practices

of the FBI, requested detailed information and numerous

documents regarding former indices utilized by this Bureau

in connection with apprehension and detention of individuals

during national emergency.

As a result of sSc requests,.

information and documents sought were provided and have been

made a part of the recently released report of the SSC regarding

their findings of their investigation of the FBI. A UPI news

release dated 3/8/76 by Nicholas Daniloff reflects in part that

documents provided the SSC showed:

1) Hoover ignored a

July, 1943, order by Attorney General Francis Biddle and

continued to compile a list of aliens and citizens who might

Internal

Security Act of 1950 was tooliberal, and 3) In 1960,

the

FBI did not tell the Justice Department it was compiling

a special list of educators, labor leaders, writers, entertainers,

lawyers, doctors and others with alleged "

subversive associations

and ideology" who might be dangerous in time of national

emergency.

Regarding Item I, the sse was provided a document

dated July 16, 1943, from AG Francis Biddle to Hugh B. Cox,

Assistant Attorney General and J. Edgar Hoover, Director,

FBI,

which related to the former Custodial Detention List (CDL)

and dangerousness classifications which had been utilized by

the Bureau and the Department during the early part of

World War II.

This document indicated "There is no statutory

authorization or other present justification for keeping a

"Custodial Detention' list of citizens.

The Department

fulfills its proper functions by investigating the activities

of persons who may have violated the law. It is not aided

in this work by classifying persons as to dangerousness.

This letter further indicated the classification system

was

a mistake and the AG directed that classifications previously

made should not be regarded

as

classifications of dangerousness

or as a determination of fact in any sense, and in the future

should not be used for any purpose whatsoever. Mr. Biddle

indicated questions raised as

a particular individual should be disposed of by consideration

of all available information but without reference to any

classification previously assigned. Subsequent to the document,

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re:

senstudy 75

a letter to all SACs dated August 14, 1943, was sent

indicating, in part, cards previously known as custodial

Detention Cards would be known as security Index cards

and the list composed of such cards would be known as the

security Index (st Additionally, this Letter advised, Iox

intormation, that the AG, on 7/16/43, ordered the dangerousness

classifications previously made by the Department were not to

be used in the future for any purpose whatsoever.

Mr. John I.

HIllI, Stall Member, sC, has interpreted the 1943 document

to mean the FBI could no longer maintain a list of individuals

who were then considered dangerous to the national security

and by renaming the CDL to the SI the FBI had ignored a direct

order from the AG.

We are presently preparing a document

to be forwarded to the AG noting a protest of Mr. Elliff's

interpretation of this matter, and it is the contention of

the FBI that the AG did not order us to cease maintaining

a list of individuals who should be considered dangerous to

the national security, but that the order pertained to the

dangerousness classifications then being assigned by the

Department.

It is therefore the Bureau's interpretation

that the AG's order pertained strictly to the Departmental

classifications of dangerousness of individuals and not

to the authority of the FBi to maintain a list of those

individuals of significant importance during that period

in history which related to the national security.

Item 2 of the UPI release indicated that during

1952 the Bureau won permission from the Department to

maintain our own plan for arresting subversives because

the Internal Security Act of 1950 was too liberal. On

8/3/48 the FBI was furnished by the Department a portfolio

regarding the apprehension and detention of individuals who

proper to one a ep ton

could be considered dangerous during a national emergency.

I'his portiolio was provided at a time prior to any law which

provided Ior the detention of dangerous individuals at the

time of an emergency." "Based on this portfolio, standards

and guidelines were established by the FBI and

approved by

the AG by which the plans maintained in the Department's

portionio could be implemented. Upon passage of the

Internal security Act of 1950, commonly referred to as

the Emergency Detention Act (EDA), numerous discussions

and communications concerned

'the differences apparent

between the Department's portfolio and the EDA.

The FBI'S

planning and operational procedures for any apprehension had

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re:

Senstudy 75

been based on the Department's portfolio and not on the

detention provisions of Title II of the EDA.

Following

passage of

the ida, the Department, during 1950, indicated

Title II of the EDA was undoubtedly in conflict

with the

Department's program

and if Title II remained in effect at

such time as initiation of the Department's program woulc

become necessary, appropriate provisions for repeal of the

EDA would be introduced along with steps to be taken under

the Departmental program, inasmuch as the EDA, as enacted,

contained many provisions which would be unworkable in event

of an emergency or outbreak of hostilities, and it was not

anticipated Title II would permanently supersede the Department's

program.

During 1952, it became apparent a definite and

positive stand should

be obtained

from the Department

over this highly controversial matter.

Efforts were made

to obtain such a positive statement from the Departmen bI

however, it was felt under no circumstances should the

make any commitments regarding the desirability of

proceeding under the EDA or the Departmental program.

Inasmuch as it was our impression the Department desired

to continue under their program, a letter was submitted

to the AG indicating it was not

within the province of the

Bureau to recommend the adoption of any one program as

opposed to another; however, a definite and clear-cut answer

was requested of the at as to whether the AG would intend to

proceed in an emergency under the Departmental program and as

to whether standards to be used for inclusion of an individual

on the si then in use met with his approval. During

November, 1952, the AG indicated he wished to assure the

FBI it was the

Department's intention in the event of

emergency to proceed under the program as outlined in the

Department's portfolio invoking the standards then used.

Item 3 indicates the Bureau failed to advise the

Justice Department of the compilation of a list of influential

persons with alleged "subversive associations and ideology"

who might be dangerous in time of national emergency.

This

statement. refers to the formulation of our Reserve Index (RI)

during 1960.

The RI was previously known as the Communist

Index; however, during 1960 it was felt the name RI would be

more descriptive as the index at that time also contained the

names of individuals formally affiliated with subversive

organizations other than the Communist Party. The RI, when

established, was divided into two

sections, namely Section A

and section B. Section A was to include the identities of

individuals whose subversive activities did not bring them

within the si criteria but who, in a time of nationa

emergency, would be in

a position to influence others

against the national interests or would be likely to furnish

financial or material aid to subversive elements due to their

subversive associations and ideology. Section A was to

include, therefore, individuals of influence, such as

protessors, writers, lawyers, educators, scientists, and other

influential persons

on a local or national level.

of the RI was to include

the identities of other

• individuals

who were felt could possibly be dangerous during a national

emergency but whose

activities did not meet the criteria for

inclusion in the SI.

The Department was not advised of the

existence of the RI inasmuch as the individuals who were

maintained thereon were not subjects for apprehension or

detention as were those individuals maintained on the sI.

The RI was used as an administrative aid within the Bureau

of those cases considered of such importance that the

individuals so listed could use their influence during time

of a national emergency.

Results of investigations of the

individuals maintained on Section A of the RI were

disseminated to the Department so the Department would be

made aware of the activities of these individuals.

SENATE SELECT COMMITIRE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVISA OR FORDER FBI INSPICIOR BY SSC

"Statement

"I consider that the IBI had a valid basis for

investigating Marcin Luther King to determine the extent

of communist influence being exerted on him. Allegations

and inquiries had been received from many sources, including

nembers of Congress, the White Fouse and the Department of

Justice, concerning

the possibility king was under communist

domination or influence. Many suggested IBI inquisy in

this connection be made. the President and the Attorney

Gencral vere awarc the r'Bl instituted investigation.

Attorney Ceneral Robert Kennedy approved the use of telephone

surveillences. the investigation did establish a person

reported to be a communist to be on the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) staff as well as a commnist

contact by King outside his regular staff. The results of

the investigation vere disseninated to the Actorney General.

The President and the Attorney General wore both concerned

and Attorney General. Robert Kennedy spoke with King about it.

Certain steps were taken to neutralize the communist influence

on King.

Whether or not each was fully justified may be a

matter of judgment.

Certainly in the main all were designed

to counter the efforts of the Communist Party in this general

arca, and vere not intended as harassrent of Fing or to

affect his constitutional rights.

Instructions issued to

the fiola called for the approval at FBI leadquarters

before the implementation of any such actions. Some were

approved; others were disapproved. However, to my knowledge,

the anonynous letter to King, which has been the subject of

news corment, was never submitted for official approval.

I em certain lix. Hoover would never have approved any letter

which might have been interpreted to encourage suicide,

although I do not personally believe this to be the logical

implication in the letter.

Fron what I have seen in the

press, and I have no other knowledge concerning it, I think

RE: INTERVILI OF PONIER FBI INSPECIOR BY SSC

it much more logical that the writer intended to suggest

King's witharaval fron the roverent for racial equality,

that his presence in the novement under the circumstances,

that is under communist influence, was detrimental to the

rovErent.

Press statements indicate a draft of the letter

was found in the papers of a former bureau ofricial, who

has denied knowledge of the letter. At any rate it is

quite apparent the letter was never approved by tir. Hoover,

he had no knowledge oi it, and there was never other

oIlicial Sureau approval for this lettez.

"'It should be noted that, at the time of this

Inquiry, Ix. V. C. Sullivan was the Assistant Director In

Charge of the Division and he took personal interest and

supervision in this case, often dealing directly with the

supervisor to whom the case was assigned without discussion

with intervening personnel, and I was an intervening official

at the tice.

thus he is in the best position to answer

questions concerning the investigation of King. Horever,

his statements must, of course, be evaluated in light of his

foxced retirement by Mr. Hoover, the causes of this action

and subsequent developments.

"End 0f Statement

"I was then asked if I could name the specific

members of Congress who, according to my statement, had made

allegations or inquiries concerning possible communist

influence over King. I said I did not recall the names of

specific Congressmen but had a clear recollection several

such inquiries had been received by Bureau officials. 1

was then asked to define the tern 'neutralize" as used with

reference to communist influence. I said I meant "to render

ineffective' in using this word.

a credible source concerning an organization of signifi-

cance to our society. I was then asked it there vas a

set period for the running of such an investigation and a

set time for terination. I said this would dopend on the

when the case was reviewed. I was then asked if the King

case was set for periodic revier.

I said it received

almost dally revier, I was then asked if King vas actually

Influenced by communists and how much. I said I felt he

had been intluenced specifically when he was considering

the March on Washinzton as he was encouraged by a Communist:

Party nenber to hold the larch, and the Communist Farcy

had an interest in the larch, but the excent to which fing

was intluenced is diificult to assess.

I was then asked if

I could also recall any other instance there the Commnist

Party had pressed King to take action of interest to the

Communist Party. I said I did not recall specific instances

but he was under constant exposure to such influence. I

was then asked if the FBI Was upset because of the action

taken by the Pepartment in discussing the matter with King.

I said 'not to my knowledge.'

taken to discredit King. I was then asked if I could recall

any of the actions to which lit. adams made reference.

said I could not but, if they wished to show me the list,

I would be glad to lool: at it. They did not do so but returned

to the memorandum referred to above and asked me to reread

Tras asked to nane other counterintelligence techniques

which might be used in any case, whereupon I asked what

purpose such a line of questioning had in this interview.

Postal said he thought it might serve to refresh my

recollection of actions of like nature taken in the King

case. I said I thought further discussion along these

lines was pointless, that I was satisfied it would not

bring to mind any specific such actions in the King case.

"I was also shown a copy of a memorandum dated

January 6, 1964, concerning the authorization of microphone

coverage to develop 'intelligence and counterintelligence

information' and asked if the term 'counterintelligence'

as used here meant the development of data as to King's

personal conduct or misconduct. I said as far as I knew

it xelated to the commnist influence inquiry we were then

making as to King•

"I was also shown a menorandum prepared by

I'. Sullivan in which he mentioned the possible removal of

King fron the civil rights movement and recommended that a

man named Pierce be grooned as a replacement rather than

leave a vacuum and have many of King's followers end up in

the luslims or similar group. Sullivan referred to King

in this memorandum as 'an avowed communist." I was asked

the basis for this statement; specifically, did King himself

make the statement? I said that, while I did not recall

the details, I did recall that an individual who had been

in contact with King referred to him as an avowed communist

who would not join the party because he was a minister.

It was not clear in my memory if this was based on a

RE: INTCHVIE:! OR FORMS& RAI MISPECIOR BY SSE

memorandum suggests that lir. Sullivan felt strongly that

King was a detriment to the civil rights movement but

cost certainly neither lix. Hoover nor lit. Sullivan could

be said to have had a vendetta. I was then asked if

Fr. Sullivan ever said he was out to "get' King. I said

I didn't recall Sullivan's having made such a statement.

I was then asked what Sullivan had said to roflect his

feelings toward King. I said I believed I could recall

statements sinilar to those which appear in paragraph two

oi the scrorancun in question, that I thought it portrayed

his fcelings. I vas then asked by Postal hov I felt about

King.

I said that I did not feel as strongly as Sullivan

but did feel that it as unfortunate that a man highly

placed in the civil rights novement insisted on continuing

contact with rembers of the Communist Party even though

he had been warned by the Attorney General and assistant

Attorney Ceneral Burke Marshall against such association.

In this connection, I had been shown a copy of a Desarindun

by Courtney Evans relating to a discussion with Burkc

Marshall who said he had discussed this with King. Marshall

also made some reference to a leak in the King case which

resulted in a notation by the Director concerning 'passing

the buck' to the bureau as to lcak. I was asked to interpret

tr. Hoover's notation, but said I thought it spoke foi

itself. Reference was

then made to a notation by lit. Hoover

at the foot of the memorandur concerning the replaccent

di King by Pierce in which the birector commented to the

effect that finally Domestic Intelligence Division officials

were realizing King was under the influence of communists.

I was asked if Mr. Hoover's notation carried with it the

approval of the recommendation of the menorandum. I said

I thought that approval was implied. Then I Was

asked 1f

the recommendation had been carried out and I said 'not to

my knowledge."

I was then asked why lix. Hoover had made

such a statement, if Nr. Hoover's comtent criticizing the

Lonestic Intellizence Division officials indicated a

special attitude on his part toward king and the civil

rights noverent, and that would have notivated such a

remont. I saili, oi course, hit. Hoover did not have a

"special attitude' toward King and/or the civil rights

e course s

moverent; hovever, I had no doubt he was frequently subjected

to corments by other Governent officials, Congressren

and others about the alleged communist intluence surrounding

King with the sirong advice that sorething should be done

about it.

"I was also shown a nenorandum dated jugust 24,

1964, Thich I wrote authorizing microphone and telephone

coverage of King in the Newark Field Division. I had

approved the installation in the interest of time and noted

ve did not nced new attorney Concral authority for the

telephone surveillance as he had previously approved coverage

on 'any residence' to which king nighi so. I was asked is

I thought this included a hotel and I said I did. I Was

then asked 1 I thought the original approval of October,

1963, was still applicable in August, 1964. I Said I

thought it was. I was asked it we were not required to

get Attorney General approval of a nicrophone installation.

I said "not at that tine.'

"I was asked why this investigation had run so

long, why it had not been discontimed. I said that King

had not divorced himself from all communist contact and

therefore the investigation vas continued.

"I tas also asked if I recalled action taken to

discredit King with a religious group, ut liorquette University

and in similar situations, and I said I did not specifically

recall those actions.

RE: INIORVIDI OF FORIER FBI INSP:CION BY SSC

"'I was asked if I thought the investigation of

King was a valid one and I said I did. I was asked if te

had any other Coninfil Investigations similar to the King

case and I said I did not recall any. This terninated

the interview. However, while vaiting for an elevator

after leaving the interview room, a remark was made by

Postal concerning ny inability to recall more specific

counterintelligence actions. I again mentioned the number

of intervening years, the thousands of matters handled

in the interin prior to my retirenent and the fact that,

for security reasons, each retiring or resigning employee

at time of debriefing was admonished to renove from his

memory to the extent possible the facts concerning confi-

dential Bureau activities to which he was privy as en

employee, and that I had taken these admonishments seriously."

The Attorney General

NOTE:

SSC request of December 16 asked for delivery of

materials pertaining to authorization and purpose of certain

electronic surveillances during the period 1973 - 1975, and

in addition, for information relating to entries over the

past five years which were "not directed at a non-resident

alien in the service of a foreign power."

We responded to

this December 16 request in a memorandum of January 7, 1976;

however, this entry was not included since our interpretation

of the request at that time appeared to exclude this incident.

on March 4, Mr. Blackhurst, Assistant Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Department of Justice,

advised that John Elliff of the SSC's Domestic Task Force

requested certain information regarding the entry being

reported here.

Mr. Elliff apparently obtained a sunmary

chart of surreptitious entries we furnished the House Select

Committee in which the 1972 entry, against an "Arab Terrorist

Activist" was noted. Elliff wished information relating to

the entry and the level on which the action was approved.

Review of the file in question (Abu Ayman Wadi,

FBIHQ 105-203076; Dallas 105-3138) fails to show the authority

who approved the

entry.

The file does show. a Dallas request

for telephone and microphone surveys, which

includes request

to photograph documents, etc. This particular communication

shows a Bureau telephone call was made to Dallas, apparently

authorizing the requested activity; however, the

identity of

the official calling Dallas was not noted.
