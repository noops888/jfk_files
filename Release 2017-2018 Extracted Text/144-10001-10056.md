32. SECTION III/S - Alert In Oriento Province Balleted to he Teruinated: (see

Iter (13, hollis 25/25 Novender):

The alert in Orient Province in be lieved to be

terinated. The alort, ap-

parently prompled by Presiilent Kennedy'g death on 22 Notember, was possibly pre-

scheduled to tominate on ::5 lorenter. There have been two orders wich suiest

that the alert ras destived to be concluded on 25 November: They ares

1) Access to the coastal observation post at Punta Maisi (20-15 74-09W) was

restrictad until 25 iuvember because of the alert.

2) Subordinates of Banos, Isadquarters Eastero Naval Histrict, vere to raceive

further orders on the 25th, presumably concerning their alurt ststury so such orders

bave boon noted in communications.

There bave been no furthor referances in intercepted communications to tha

alert since 02222 on 23 Movembar.

It is possible that the restricted access to tie observation post at Punta

"latsi extends to other observatior posts in Crienta Province such as reported on:

23 lovenbar when First Army Coastal Observation Posta wore placed in alert status,

and that the restriction vas to be liftod = 25 November by all those pasts.

Further indications that the alert was terminated is the fact that the Cujer

Mary was enjaged in an 1gland-wide conminications exorcire on 25 November. It 13

considered unlikely that such an exercise would be conducted under aiert conditions,

mere hava baen no furthor refarences to the alert status of the D Percent

Santiago de Cuba) units wich was first obserrod on 23 November. All CRAF and

Soriat Forces Cuba Cormunications appear to be normal during this perfod,

22 - 26 Norembor 1963.
