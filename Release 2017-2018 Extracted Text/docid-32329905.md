BINION stated during February he had been

contacted by an Italian by the name of LOCATTO (phonetic)

who stated he

had some word from another Italian in Los

Angeles who had served time with BINION in the U.S. Penitentiary

at Leavenworth. BINION stated the information was

of no value

to anyone and he thought the main

purpose of this contact was

to try to get some money from him.

BINION was contacted during March 1959, concerning

suspects in an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor

Vehicle case entitled JOHN E. CHAMBERS; UNSUB, (2) Roy McGrath;

Ron Chambers, SU 26-17802; who had contacted him while in Las

Vegas. BINION furnished information concerning the automobile

to Bureau Agents in identifying UNSUBS.

Prosecution in this

case was subsequently declined.
