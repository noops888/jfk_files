strative Data

Confidential Source DOMINGO ROCHE advised he printed

1,000 envelopes for the Dominican Revolutionary Union but did

not print chance books for that organization.

The Spanish language newscaster in the details of the

report is Confidential Source DOMINGO ROCHE, whose name was not

set forth in order to further protect his identity.

ROCHE ad-

vised that LUIS PENA actually suggested that he, ROCHE, tape

PENA's telephonic conversation in order that it would appear

that the telephone calls were coming from the Dominican Republic.

The translation from "El Imparcial" was conducted by

SA GENTRY LOWE.

PH T-2 (PCI

advised that the elderly

woman who was solicited for tunas by LUIS PENA was his grand-
