SUBJECT

: LIENVOY TDY Report

• : TDY support of the LIENVOY operation in Mende

City was provided by this office during the perlod 23 April to

19 May 1964.

The Stall Agent, ARNOLD I. AREHART who managed

thia operation underwent surgery for & hernia on the 24th of April.

The undersigned assumed the responsibilitles and performed the

duties asociated with the LIENVOY operation during ARCHART'

convalescence. He was incapacitated for duty from 23 April until

12 May.

His operation was succeseful and recovery was normal.

AREHART returned to work on 12 May in a weakened condition and

three dayo of overlap was allowed to provide againtanco with

the more stronuous and tirosome chores.

The LIENVOY Installation was found to be lo

excellent condition.

The operating personnel were well dieciplined

and their procedures were well organined. The dally work was

being accomplished lu a bielnees like and efficient manner.

AREHART has done a commendablo job in establisbing and main»

taining thie highly productive operation,

3. The equipment ln this Installation has been in une

niteen houre a day for over four yearo. Au the reault of good

maintenance practices it is in good shape and functioning well.

B.

The drying up of the ball point pens in the B-10,

Dial Recordor has beon a constant nuisance aince

the beginaing of thie operation. The pressure

menaltive tape was the obvious answer to this

problem, but the firet ten rolle of pressure

tape were received after nearly four years ol

struggling with the defective pens. It la

recommended that pressuro sensitive tape be

supplied to this operation for future une.

The ten rolle of pressure sensitive tape

received during this IDY were wound back-

wards on their spindles.

D. The tires on the idler wheel of the B-10 are

drying and cracking and fail to obtain adequate

traction on the flywheel. This causes tape

feed problems. It is recommended that three

dosen new idler wheels ba pouched to AREHART

immediately. Several of the defective Idles

wheels are avallable in this offien for

inspection.

The Rapacki Plan

The Polish proposal for a Central European

nuclear-free zone was introduced

at the 2 October 1957

session of the UN General Assembly

by the Polish Foreign

Acting as spokesman for the

Government, he formulated the proposal:

both East and West Germany agree to a ban on the produc-

storage of nuclear weapons on their territories,

simultaneously introduce an identical han on

her territory.

Rapackt did not mention Czechoslovakia,

but the head

of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking

after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his

country would Join the agreement,

extending the

East Germans subsequently varoly

Rapacki's proposal

had obviously been cleared and

coordinated with Soviet leaders prior to its introduction.

Moscow promptly reported the proposal aporovingly and the

Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would he rel

comed by the peoples of Europe,

would facilitate agreement

on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and

"help improve relations and briny closer together" the tro

Gersan states.

The proposal was formalized in a 9 December 1957

government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki

to the US,

British, and French ambassadors in Warsaw.

then sovlet Premier,

Bulganin, promptly endorsed the

in a sertes of letters

to heads of governments through-

out the world.

In 1958 Rapacki modifled his plan, allegedly to make

it more palatable to the Western powers.

of the plan, published in Novemher 1958, called for a two-

(1) current nuclear stockpiles and

be banned in Poland,

Czechoslovakia, East and kest Gernany,

and (2) existius nuclear stockpiles

eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement

for the four-nation area.

The revised version of the

plan also called for

"alr and kround control' with NATO

and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the control

system.

Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal

agreement on the Rapacki plan.

Shortly after the opening

of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the

Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation

of a nuclear-free zone in Central europe.

basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the

Rapack1 plan.

The Soviet delegation Is currently urging

that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question

of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.

6. Since the Rapacki plan was introduced, It has had

support from Moscow.

The Soviets have

even urged

extending the zone to Include Baltic and Balkan countries.

Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a moans of

eliminating German power in Central Europe--one of Moscow's

major foreign policy objectives.

The US strongly opposes the Rapacks plan, viewing

It as a Bloc device to

neutralize Germany, to deepen

even perpetuate the division of Germany implementation of the

de facto recognition of East Germany.

proposal would also be militarily disadvantageous

US military power in

Europe would be diminished with

out a concurrent decrease of Soviet strength.

Bonu also considers

such proposals as sinister and subtly

intimidntory to the

West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt with as if they

vere inert objects, and who detect in such schemes a creatior

of conditions for their eventual communization.

president would

The training objective of the program was to familiarize

the trainees with the basic tradecraft principles and techniques

involved in the conduct of clandestine activities, with primary

emphasis on the work and activities of security services.

this lead, but even this was of value to the trainees.

One traince

was required to make a pretext tolephone call, another team of two

made a noighborhood check, and the remainder were divided into teams

to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, the Social Security

Institute and tho Metropolitan Police. Except for the last team,

all picked up some information of value, and the information and

its significance in terms of the projected investigation of PEREZ

discussed with them.

Sho three DFS men, because of their provious tralning and

experience, were ablo to

absorb and understand the lectures and

reading material much

more quickly than the others.

None of the

others had any provious training or experience in intelligence or

security work..

However, they were keenly Interested, actively

participated in classroom discussions and field exercises, and all

prepared their written work in an acceptable mauner.

The instructor

reviewed all written work with them, as woll as plans for meetings,

etc., and this proved most helpful.

Somewhat unusual for Latins,

students were

punctual; there were some very small and unimpor

tant dolays, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly

difficult traffic situation in Mexico City or to other reasons

apparently beyond

their control.

No student was absent from classes

the ontire training period, and no student was late for

more than 45 minutes or an hour.

In summary, the instructor and the Station feel that the

training objective

was accomplished, and that the triinees,

not yot experlenced operators, have a sufficient enough understanding

of the busic tradecraft principles and techniques to permit them to

begin operations.

They are all intelligent and
