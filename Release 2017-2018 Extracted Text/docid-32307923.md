Texas, of the firm A & M Associates, registered in Room 609

locate no bill for MARSHAL for this stay and could therefore

Division, IRS, Washington, D. C., advised SA LEWIS that a

search of the records of his department failed to reflect any

information identifiable with MARSHAL.

no additional information concerning MARSHAL not previously
