trial which may ensue with respect to any pertinent statenents that

they heard Glockner make ,rD-302's should be prepared and be included

It is not clear tron rerep whether the man who reportedly

told Harold Fitzsimmons on the norning of 5/24/63 that he had the

Ilconce number of the automobile which sped from the scene of the

shooting is Frank Kinnerle or whether there may be another witness

who has not jet been located.

Necessary investigation to clarily

this point

should be conducted.

It is noted further that rerep does not indicate that

during interviers sone persons who may be suspects in this ease

vere advised of their rights at the outset of the interview.

Newark

should insure that in all intervievs conducted in the future with

possible suspects these individuals are advised of their rights

at the beginning of each interview.

On the basis of intoration set out in rerep and in the

report of 3A Bussel I. Sullivan deted 6/7/63 at New York, it is

suggested

that the following lines of investigation, in'addition to

the other investigation which is now under way, be pursued to a

proper conclusion.

New York FCI

advised that Ton Benny, "Bull" Kerrother 4

and carry guns.

and "porky" Daleyky Appears that the only investigation which

friends orthomss J, Reynolds, are strong-ard Ben

has been conducted is an intervien with Thoras Henny set out on

page 216 of rerep.

According to this individual, "Dorky" Daley

died several, years ago.

No information was developed nor was

any investigation conducted concorning "Dull" Kenny.

It is

suggasted

that inquiries be nade in an elfort to verify the death of "Porky"

Daley; that "Bull" Kenny be identilted,

located and intervieved;

that statenents be obteined fron bin and Thomas kenny as to their where-

abouts during the pertinent period and that investigation be conducted

to verify or refute the alibis that they funish.

Efforts should be

made to determine further whether these individuals have been known to

carry guns. If so, the guns should be located and considered as

possible suspect weapons in connection with the shooting of

Glockner •

Similar investigation should be conducted with respect to

with Reynolds.

Snith also said that Barrett usually

pistol.

Efforts also should be made to verify Snith's statement

that Nunzio Provenzano reportedly was seen giving noney to Barrett

and Clark. If this can be substantlated the reason

i for Nunzio

Provenzano paying these individuals should be determined.

With respect to the gun involved in the murder of Glockner,

it is noted that the laboratory report of the New Jersey State

Police,

set out on pages 306 and 30% of rerep, did not state the

make of weapon used in the murder or the probable make of this

weapon. for the information of Newark and New York, the fBI Labora-

tory has advised that fron descriptive data set out

in the mentioned

laboratory report it appears that the bullets would have been fired

from a Colt revolver chambered for .38 caliber Smith and Wesson

cartridges.

This opinion is based on the fact that the rifling

characteristics are six lands and grooves with a leithand twist.

The possibility also should not be overlooked that some Spanish made

revolvers may have similar rifling characteristics.

Newark and New York should consider the leasibility of

examining pistol permits issued by local authorities in an effort

to determine whether any permits were issued to officials or members

of Local 560 or their associates for a .38 caliber Colt revolver.

If so, consideration should be given to endeavoring to locate the

weapons in order that test specimens may be fired from them.

Investigation should be made to determine whether Angelo

Sporaco, reported by NK2282-C as a strong-arm man for the union and

as having visited the office of Teamsters Local 810 in New York City

twice during the week prior to 5/24/63 'accompanied by Nunzio

Provenzano and Sal Briguglio, was involved in the murder of Glockner.

Sporaco's whereabouts during the pertinent period should be ascer-

tained and necessary investigation conducted to verify or refutehis

alibi.

event that PROVENZANO went to jail.

scheduled to contact GLOCKNER made some remark and GLOCKNER

refused to go with them. In a "hot-headed exchange", GLOCKNER

was shot.

NK 2150-C stated that the truckers with whom he is

familiar have commented that ZAPPY REYNOLDS is possibly responsible

for the shooting.
