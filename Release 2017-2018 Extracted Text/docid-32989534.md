The Interview bogan at 10:00 a,me and lasted for two and ona-hale hours. It

was pleasant enougn in all respects, conducted in good hunor throughout. *

Ellife's stated purpose in Interviewing me was to leam the origins and func

tions of the Bureau's Office of Legal Counsal. So, during much of the ineerview

I talked and ha riote luriousiy, Synopsirad, of course, I vent throught the his

In the beginning-dating averything (as in Christlanity) from the time that

a cartain noted figure took over-there was no in nouss counsel.:there saum to

be two reasons. First, the vast majority of the Agents were law trained. I think

the figure for 1940, when I entered, as 90 per cento Thus tha Agants were equippo

stell, This development followed on the new activisi" approach of the Supreme

Court under warren which brought the landmark decisions of Mallory, Napp, lilI-

anda, and

so.inany others, all of which complicated the crininal law enormously

for both FBI Agents and for the officers of other jurisdictions to whom the FBI

taught criminal law in the FBI National Academy and elsewhere. More than that,

these dacisions came at a tima when the percentage of lawyers in the Agent force

• had greatly daclined. It thus was obvious that both the supervision me lezal

matters and the tralning given to Agents and othar officers must be gavatly inn

creased. This brought you and Join llotis and otnars into the function, for

Donelan and I could no longer carry the load.

The final step was the establishnent of tha Office of Legal Counsel as a sap

arate division of ide FBi. This happened vithout advance notice to ne. It as

in January or February of 1971 (memory fades) when Hoover called me to his off.

ice. He opened by naming about fiva Federal law enforcement agencias such as the

Secret Service, the Marcotics Bureau, and others, that had their own consal

and concluded by

raying that the FBI had greater need of in house counsel than

any of these. He made me Inspector in Charge, and 17 days lates made me Assis.

tant Directora

• Ellif was interested in knowing why Hoover chosa that moment to create the

• naw division. I told him, and quite truthfully, that i did not know-hoover dia

not say, at least not to na. Elliff pressed the matter, lor and I pointed out

that I could only speculate. The best spaculation, in my opinion, is that the

nove was related to the

extreme embarassment which came to hoover because of

his publie statement, prior to any grand jury action, concerning the evidence

against those two priests and

their followers who were alleged to be planning

to blow up the District sewer system. That statement, I pointed out, was never

brought to my attention until after it had been

made. Had I known of it in ado

vance, I would have strongly counseled

against it. Somewhere in this time area,

I speculated, Hoover must have decided that he badly needed a closer legal mon

itoring of everything that went on in the FBi.

This brought up the anamôlous position so lung occupied by the Legal Research

Desk which had so troubled me. I was absolutely and totaily rasponsible lor an

sering any legal question raised to my by anyone in tha FBI, but I had no au

thority whatsoever to inquira into legal problems not raised to me: Inis liarsa

situation changed complately when the new division was established. Cur first

orders from lioover were to ises everything" going out of the FBI that might

embody or affect a legal question. He strove manfully to do so for a while,

but

the volume of pavar coming across the desk was simply too large. So, with hoover":

permission and over his signature, I put out a motice to all headquarters pers-

onnel which made each supervisor, division, cic., initially responsible los

recognizing tha actual or possible axistence of a legal problem and which dir-

ected them to bring all such problems to our attention. and so it went untii i

ratired.

Ellift was Interested in knowing why I was so puloily raised from Inspactor-

in-Charge to Assistant Diractor. Again, Hoover never told no, but li ono must

speculato I would suggest

that it was because I handled to his satisfaction two

•sorious legal matters which came up in the first few days. One was a proposal

from the General Intelligence Division that a file do estabilshad

on each Sena

ator and U.S. Represantative and that into that file be thrown all miscellaneous

Information concerning the person that came to our attention without investiga-

tion. The purpose was entirely innocent, and of some efficiency, viewed solely

from an investigative standpoint. The fBI had lately become responsible for in-

vestigati is attacks against thase peoplo, and it is sansible to bellove that tha

more the Agent knows abour the victim the better tha chance he has of solving the

crime. out, I countered, the fact that the fBl kept such files would filter out

to public knouledge and

irmediatoly be misinterpreted to mean that the Fil ras

not do.

Hoover agraado About the same time thare came fron the Domestic Intelli

gence Division a proposal that an informant be sent to Canada to gather infosi

ation there on certain 6.5. citizens in whom the fbi had a legitinate interest.

Canadá was not to be infonned. I countered that this was unwise; something of

the same kind had happened a few years earlier, had been discovered, and had is

sulted in quite a stink being raised in the Canadian Parliament. I suggested that

on nether boing to

the fBi work in this informant through the RO?, Hoover agreed, and it was so

done to the benefit of both this country and Canada and without 'an unfortunate

incident.

Both these matters, it might ba pointed out, were not strictly legal. But the

effectiva lawyar remembers that just as no man is ăn island neither is a legal

question. The question exists always in some poïitica:, economie, sociological,:

or philosophical context, and

We next discussed, at Ellifi's request, the functions of ths Office of lagai

Counsel. Hore pointedly, why could not these functions be performed by the U.s.

Attorney and the Depariment of Justice? For many reasons, I said First, and in

general, it daries all comnon sense and the laws of human nature

to believe that

the Director of the FBI and his people can get adequate counsel from any lawyer

over whom they have no control whatsoever, wrom they do not pay, promote or dem

mote. The FBI must necessarily be in a position to demand a quick answer from

counsel. The SAC in Butte, for example, may call at 10:00 agul, or 10:00 p.in.,

as the situation raquires. He has located a fugitive, and sees a potential searci

problem. le might got a good ansger from the Department if wa write them a memo

and wait three weeks land again we might not, depending on who answers Ene ques

the SAC needs a positive answer-a "do this" and "don't do that" answer, specific,

to the point, and suscaptible of being transiated into immediate action. lone of

ledge of the criminal law is "hornsook" variety. Some U.S. Attorneys are overly

cautious, reluctant. to take a stand, with the result that the fBl would underuse

it's authority, to the public detriment. Some are aggressiva prosecutors out to

takon. Thus it is that the FbI desire to keep lis legal actions clean as

round's tooth may contlict with the ambition of tha prosecutor. I still remember

an Assistant. U.S. Attorney who spent half an hour on the telephone trying to

harangus, badger and bluff me into sending Agents out to arrost a Secret serv

ice fugltive when both he and I knew that we had no jurisdiction to male such

an arrest, ind then some S, Attorneys simply want hayoire in thair interprat

ation of the law. If I renaber correctly, it was the U.S. Attorneys in the sast

ern District of Illinois and one the the districts of Mississippl uno onca took

the position that a

person arrested by the FBI must be brought bafore the then

Cormissioner by the arrestedg agent and by no other. & had to fight them both

cosin on that one and it took a vic of doing. So,. hace again the FBi needed its

cAn counsel.

Functions of FBI in house counsei break down into a faw obvious catagorles,

I told Ellifi. Counsel nust to sone reasobable extent rove through currant FBI

work iooking for proulens, present and potential. Some can be soived on the sp0z,

so to spear. Others must be taken to the Department, such as those which necess-

arily involve Deparient oi Administration polic", or which are of such potantiai

for damage that the E3l wants before acting to exhaust all expert advice avail-

able to it. It is a matter of considerable discretion to decide nich questions

can and should be answered in-house, in order to not be badgering the Departeet

• every other minute, and which must be raised to the Department. Ihis can be done

by an experienced

F3I Agent-Lawyer, and by no other. And then there is

can an en a by t

the con-

stant need for FBI legal instruction, which I described but on which I dia not

dwell, believing the reed

to de obrious and; in general, for the same reasons

as those discussed above.

i.

In response to Elliff's questions I admitted that the great bulk of the work

of the Office of Legal Counsel came

from the criminal side of FBI jurisdiction.

And quite naturally so. It was (I speak of my time only)in the criminal area

that most of the Agents were employed. and it was with some historical justi

fication that those doing intelligence work thought themsalves not responsible

to the criminal law, although we did all possitle to inoci that error out of

their heads. They thought thenselves only inte ligence gatherers, and so

It was then that we got such flascoes as that "high Sierras" case, which doover

This discussion led to talis of the slonder legal jurisdiation for the voris

In answer to Ellite's questions, I disclaimed all responsibility of the Offica

Associate Deputy Attorney General

SUBJECT: Legal Expenses of FBI Agent Kehoe

DATE: October 20, 1975

Consistent with the new policy we are adopting on

representation of government employees, the Deputy has

decided that the Department should reimburse Special

Agent Kehoe for legal expenses incurred by him in

connection with his recent appearance before the Church

Committee.

It is our understanding that Mr. Kehoe will

continue to need legal advice in connection with the

Church Committee investigation..

Since we would benefit

from his knowledge of the case, and in the interest of

continuity, the lawyer already retained by Mr. Kehoe

should, if possible, now be hired by the Department.

that on 11/7/75 the Navy was going to release to aforementioned

committees and the press information on drug experimentation

and that the FBI was mentioned in the pertinent files.

Those files were reviewed at the Pentagon on 11/6/75 by

Supervisor J. P. Thomas of INTD. They had been classified

"Secret" and "Top Secret" but now have been completely

declassified. FBI was mentioned in connection with three -

projects. There are no FBI documents in the files.

A memorandum dated 9/21/50 from Mr. Alberti to

elsewhere in the file as Jack H. Alberti, Office of Naval

62-116395

A memorandum dated 8/15/7 on letterhead of

Office of Chief of Naval Operations concerned "Top Secret

Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) Project on Speech-

Inducing Drugs," reported a meeting on 8/11/50 attended by

personnel of NMRI, CIA, Office of Naval Research (ONR), a

drug company representative and Mr. DeLoach and Mr. D. J.

Parsons of the FBI Laboratory. The purpose of the meeting

was to brief the FBI on a CIA project on narco-hypnosis and

on the NRI project. Parsons reportedly said the FBI had

no such project, but had information on the experiences of

Various police

departments in the United States with speech-

inducing drugs. He agreed to make the FBI information

available to NMRI and CIA. ONR agreed to give FBI, NMRI

and CIA a study by ONR on projected research to improve

polygraph reliability. Recipients were to give their comments

and recommendations on the study to ONR. At the meeting

NMRI gave DeLoach an 8/11/50 NMRI progress report on its

project.

Parsons agreed to look into the possibility of

getting volunteers from prisoners in Federal institutions

and to supply NMRI with canabis (marijuana) and heroin to

the extent they might be available to the FBI. It is noted

that no IBI representatives were listed in the memorandum

reporting a 9/27/50 meeting of this group and there is no

Iurther record in the file of FBI participation. Neither is

there any record that the FBI supplied any drugs for the

project.

' Material regarding project "CHATTER" included a

carbon copy of a rough draft memorandum (no letterhead)

bearing the penciled date "11/50?" which contained the

following, "Since 1947 the Department of the Naxy has

carried on a project in coordination with the Departments

of the three Services, of CIA and FBI consider this project

memorandum says that a project submitted to ONR by Professor

Richard Wendt of the University of Rochester (NY) had been

approved by all the agencies involved and recommended

funding the project.

The file indicates subsequently that

this project did go forward and involve human experimentation.

Another file dealt with project "CALLING CARD,"

1952-1953, designed "to render an individual subservient to

imposedwill or control." FBI was not mentioned.

A memorandum dated 9/5/50 for Mr. D. J. Parsons,

FBI; C. Edwards, CIA; and Captain Wilbur E.

Kellum of

Naval Medical Research, from W. S. Post, JI. (not further

identified), informed them that a copy of the report on the

'Ellson" project (University of Indiana, 1952) was being

forwarded to them for information. The project involved

research in the detection of deception. The addressees were

Wto be briefed by Professor D. G. Ellson of Indiana University

on the project at a future date. The file did not show that

the briefing occurred. The project was terminated in June,

The two files reviewed contained many reports of

research conducted concerning Various drugs in various parts

of the world, constituting a collection of papers on the

subject by U. S. and foreign researchers.

NOTE:

This communication responds to referenced memorandum

which was received during the

late afternoon of 10/31/75.

It is noted that Marvin asked that these questions be

responded to by Tuesday morning, if possible. Marvin also

appended a handwritten notation requesting any documents

"you think useful that bear on these questions and that have

been forwarded to the Select Committee."

A review of the

questions and materials already submitted to the Committee

indicates that we are unable to submit such specific documents

with these responses,

although in certain instances we have

referred to a broad body of material which might serve as

background and which have already been submitted to the SSC

as well as the Department.

MAIL OPENINGS

Q. What are the standards governing issuance of a warrant to

open mail?

RESPONSE: The standards governing issuance of a warrant to open

mail are set forth in Rule 41 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure

for the United States

District Courts and cases such as Giordenello

Stanford v.

Stanford Y. Texas, 379 U.S. 477(1965), and aTd V. Harris, 403

Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108

(1964),

U.S. 573 (1971), which interpret the warrant clause of the Fourth

Amendment.

Briefly stated, a Federal law enforcement officer or an

attorney for the government must submit a sworn affidavit to a

neutral and detached magistrate.

The affidavit must set forth

sufficient facts to support a finding by the magistrate of prob-

able cause to believe a crime has been committed and the letter,

described with particularity, is or contains evidence of a crime.

In U.S. V. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249 (1970): law en-

forcement officers reasonably suspected a piece of mail contained

evidence of a crime.

They seized the package and held it overnight

while the investigation continued. Additional facts were

• obtained

and a search warrant was issued authorizing the opening of the mail.

The Suprene Court held the police conduct was reasonable under the

Fourth Amenóment.

MAIL. OPENINGS

Q. What are the procedures for seeking a warrant to open mail?

RESPONSE: When a Special Agent of the FBI desires to seek a

search warrant commanding him to open mail

he must discuss

the case with a United States Attorney. If the United States

Attorney authorizes the Agent to seck a warrant, an affidavit

for a search warrant is prepared.

The affidavit is reviewed by the Special Agent, a

Special Agent who has received intensive training in lega

natters, the Agent's supervisor and the United States Attorney

Following these reviews the Special Agent submits the affidavit

As in any case, where sound judgement dictates, ib.

leadquarters and/or the Department of Justice also may be

contacted for their advice before the affidavit is submitted

This same procedure is followed by FBI Agents in

applying for all search warrants.

What are the procedures within the I'SI for seeking authorization

to erploy electronic surveillance without a warrant?

Liesnonse:

An investigative Agent, who feels that justification exists for

use of an electronic surveillance, will address a communication to the

Federal Sureau of Investigation (ICI) Headquarters setting forth the

nature of the case and the necessary facts to support his belief that this

technique is deerced necessary. This communication containing the

Agent's recommendation is reviewed by the Agent's iramediate

Supervisor. Should the supervisor agree with the Agent, he will submit

the communication bearing his anproval to the Special Agent in Charge

of the field office who will carefully scrutinize the facts set forth and

it he agrees he will indicate his approval and send the coramunication to

Kbl Headquarters, Upon receipt at I'CI Headquarters, a Headquarters

Supervisor drafts a memorandum to the Attorney Ceneral (AC) setting

forth all pertinent facts by wich the request is believed justified

according to the language of 18 US Code 2511 (6).

The request is then presented for review and justification through

channels, 1.c,, Readqvarters Unit Chiet, Section Chiel, Eranch Chiet,

Assistant Director of the Intelligence Division, Deputy Associate Director,

Associate Director, and with the final personal approval of the Director,

Tel, the request is forwarded to the Attorney General, noting that if the

request is not felt to be completely justified at any level, it is alsapproved

or returned for further clarification or justification.

For your furthor edification, I have prepared a memorandum

to you dated October 31, 1075, and captioned "National Security Electronic

Surveillances (NSES)," wherein I furnish detailed information regarding

our procedures, steps, and criteria for requesting and approving NeEs.

Question: A.

How many entries have been accomplished per year?

Domestic Subversive and White Hate Groups

At least fourteen domestic subversive targets were

We have been unable to locate documentation showing

the approving authority for these entries; however, the

significance and sensitivity of these matters indicates

approval was made on a high level at FBIHQ.

2. Does the FBI disseminate information it has obtained

by the use of a search including electronic

surveillance to other Federal agencies?

If so, what agencies and under what standards are

decisions made as to what information should be

disseminated?

RESPONSE.

Yes. Information which has been obtained by

use of a search, both those based on a warrant and those

not based on warrant including electronic surveillance

is disseminated to other Federal agencies.

Ine Manual of Rules and RegulatIons (MRR) and the

Manual of Instructions (MOI,) are the source of IBI policy

The MRR Part II,

Section 5, states that "Dissemination is ordinarily restricted

to Federal agencies in the Executive Branch."

In tact dis

semination to such agencies comprises the vast majority of

information disseminated.

Dependent however on the exigencies

the situation information in certain instances may be dis-

seminated beyond Executive Branch agencies.

Thus the MRR

requires that where there is a threat to life, interested law

enforcement agencies with jurisdiction concerning the threat

must be advised as well as the intended victim.

so also the

MOI Part, Section 23, contains instructions which require

that the

FBI immediately notify local law enforcement con-

cerning bomb threats.

With regard to the standards employed in determining

which information merits dissemination the MRR Part II,

Section 5, establishes a backdrop against which and within

which dissemination is made.

This section notes that "the

proper atilization of information received by the Bureau,

whether through investigation or otherwise is foremost among

our responsibilities. Such information may be of vital in

terest to another Government agency and/or local law enforce

ment. * In all matters relating to dissemination, good

judgement and common sense should prevail. It is not the

Bureau policy to withhold from dissemination vital and impor

tant information to which other agencies, including local

Dep. AD Adm. law enforcement, are justifiably entitled; however good

Dop. AD iv. -judgement and connon sense dictated that the need to dissemi-

nate must be both vital, and important and within the scope of

Comp. syst present requirements to do so.

There must be no indiscrimi-

Ext. Affairs nate or arbitrary dissemination."

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

In connection with the King matter and our

forthcoming hearings next week, we need to have a

complete understanding of all actions, decisions,

proposals, recommendations and operations of FBI

personnel with respect to Dr. King during the months

of November and December 1964. Accordingly, I would

appreciate your asking the Bureau to designate a

representative who can go through the FBI files for

those months relating to King with Mr. Epstein of our

staff sometime this week.

November-December 1964 portions of the files contain

materials pertinent to our inquiry, but which we have

not yet requested, I trust that it will be acceptable

to you for such materials to be designated by Mr.

Epstein at the time of

the review for delivery to

the Committee.

I would also appreciate your making available

this week all memoranda and other materials reflecting

proposals made or actions taken which pertain to the

handwritten note which appears on the bottom of the

4/23/64 memorandum from Mr. Sullivan to Mr. Belmont

captioned "Martin Luther King" (serial #352), to wit:

"4/23 DA 6 pm I told him we are working up materials

as to what action should be

taken and what reply

should be made. He agreed."

Your continued cooperation is appreciated.

visit was to ease the pressure on issuance of a subpoena to

Cook of Taunus, West Germany, contacted the FBI in Washing-

ton about her missing son, she was very anxious to "do any-

him.

Yet the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) said in December 1969,

that Mrs. Cook declined the FBI's offer to place a missing

persons notice on Riha in the FBI bulletin. What informa-

tion did the FBI furnish Mrs. Cook to lead her to make this

unlikely decision not to pursue all possible ways to find

TO: Harold R. Tyler, Jr.

Deputy Attorney General

OM

K. William O'Connor

Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination

SUBJECT: Letter Providing SSC Access to DOJ/FBI Materials

Attached is the original of my letter of today to Mr. Elliff

which is self-explanatory, and, I think, meets the issues raised in

the attachment to the July 9, letter from Senator Church and in OUr

conference with the Attorney General. :

I believe the letter accurately states the Attorney General's

position on SSC access to the information requested. The General

Counsel's office of FBI. has advised me that Me. Kelley may wish to

speak to the Attorney General before the letter is sent, because

of the broad policy problems pertaining to FBI Illes.

I have

advised Mr. Mintz that this letter fairly and accurately reflects

both my understanding of the AG's policy, and my recent conversation

with the SSC staff in the implementation of that policy. Mr. Mintz

has asked that the letter be delayed until Mr. Kelley has an oppor

tunity to consider it; I have delayed sending the letter for that

reason, but feel it should go out today, since it simply confirms

a prior position.

I would hope that this letter and the access it authorizes

would facilitate the SSC Executive Session before which I under-

stand the Attorney General is to appear on Wednesday, July 16,

at 2:30.

I am providing a copy of this memo, my memo to Mr. Mintz,

and the attached letter to Doug Marvin so that he may advise the

Attorney General of it. I understand from Elliff that the Commitüee

expects to ask the Attorney General about his views on the need for

subpoenas,

and the "agreement" to be forthcoming which is referenced

in the June 24, letter.

Pursuant to our conversation of July Il, and confirming it,

delivery of materials to the Senate Select Cornittee staff, in addi-

tion to that which has already been made available.

Please refer to the attachments to the July 9, letter:

you and your staff may take such notes as you deem appropriate; we

have agreed that the notes are to be left in the secure room of the

Hoover Building during your study. When your study is completed,

you will prepare a summary of the information which you consider

to be appropriate for Committee use.

with senior Bureau executives to ensure the protection of national

security matters and observation of privacy considerations. There-

after, the surmary may be removed to the Commitiee's office and all

Page 5, Paragraph 3, A & B. All of the materials related

to the électronic surveillance of Dr. King, in the custody of the

FBI, will be made available to you and your appropriately cleared

staff under the same conditions and with the same agreements as

specified above with regard to the "Kissinger 17" surveillance.

Page 6, Paragraph 4. Those materials in the custody of the

FBI which reflect and relate to electronic surveillance of the

Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City in August 1964,

will be provided under the same conditions as articulated above

with regard to the "Kissinger 17" surveillance.

Page 9, Paragraph C. A summary of procedures for mail

covers has been provided by my recent letter to you. In addition

will be made available to you in Room 4171, together with access to

the underlying documentation requesting the individual mail covers.

Documentation relating to the opening of mail will be with-

held at present, due to ongoing investigations.

After your review of the mail cover summaries and any

underlying documents you wish to review, we will discuss any

further access which you may request to mail cover information.

nation that the word "implementation" in line 2 of paragraph E(1)

We will furnish to you, for your study at Senate Select

Committee offices, a complete set of the excised exhibits A-E to

Page 14, Item I. This will confirm your understanding that

the Huston Plan documents prepared by the Bureau in response to

your request under this heading have been delivered to the White

House for "third agency clearance".

This statement formally

confirms my previous discussions with you of this fact when we

met with Mc. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers, on July 2.

Be advised that

the documents which have been transmitted to the White House for

clearance will be forwarded to jou, or made available for access,

if appropriate, upon our receipt of the White House directions.

0 & C files.

After you have reviewed that analysis, I will discuss with

you an appropriate further step with regard to the 0 & C files if

such is indicated; such an agreement would be generally similar

in terms to the foregoing arrangements.

I trust that this letter accurately reflects our understanding

as reached in our discussion on July 1l. If it does not, your

inmediate advice to me of any particulars in which we disagree in

our understanding will be appreciated. In the meantime, I have

furnished a copy of this letter to the Attorney General

and the

Deputy Attorney General and have requested the Bureau's cooperation

in promptly making available the infornation indicated.

I would appreciate meeting with you and Mr. Schwarz and

Mir. Smothers around July 18,

for the purpose of discussing any

problems which you may have identified and to clarify any out-

standing documentary request which you may have, and to agree upon

an appropriate schedule. Since we have received six additional

requests from you, since the July 9, letter was delivered, it would

seem appropriate to re-analyze your requirements in light of the

agreements reached on July 11.

THE GAINESVILLE &

There is a conspiracy underway in our country, It is a cynical

attempt by a small group of men to advance their

own interests- and the

interests of their backers- by a deliberate subversion of the American

political process. Bit by bit, it is becoming know, The paitern is

emerging.

It's core is Watergate, but it syans all of Nixon's time in

office and involves people from coast to coast. Now it will focus in

Gainesville, Florida.

On July 17th, the government will start the trial of the Gainesville

8 on charges of

conspiring to violently dis-upt the 1972 Republican

National Convention.

All are members

of Vietnam Era Veterans Against

the War/Winter Soldier Organization.

were corpsmen,

and intelligence specialists.

They were

indicted for doing no more than seeking to call the truth

about what

Here are the facts behind the trial of sio

FACT- James McCord's recent

senate testimony reveals

that the government is

attempting to portray VVAW/

WSO as a

violence-prone

group of dangerous radicals.

By this, they seek to

¿justify! the Watergate

break-in

and the rest of

their political espionage.

I VVAW is dangerous, it

testimony of one William

Lemmer, an ex-paratrooper with severe psychiatric problems.

He is

just as much a casualty of the war as if he had been struck by a bullet.

•Knowing of his problems, the FBI tracked him down, set him up to be

busted and then turned hin against his brothers.

The FBI skillfully

played on his paranoia and nightmares to turn him into both an informer

and a provacateur.

Most of the violence mentioned in the indictments

was proposed by lemmer and rejected by the defendants.

FACT- Pablo

Manuel Fernandez, an associate of two of the Watergate

criminals, approached some of the Gainseville vets and offered to sell

them weapons.

At the timo, he was on the payroll of the Miami police

Fernandez was told that the vets would be used for the

purpose of "embarrassing the Democrats."

the Gainesville brothers face is a charge of attempting to acquire

weapons based on

FACT- The federal prosecution team in the trial is led by Guy Goodwin.

He personally handled the Chicago and Harrisburg conspiracy cases.

He

works in

the

Justice Department's Internal Security Division the heart

of Nixon's dirty tricks activity.

When the indictments were prepared,

his: boss was Asst. Attorney General. Robert Mardian, a right wing fanatic

who, even J. Edgar Hoover distrusted.

Shortly after that, Mardian took

a position on the Committee to Re-elect the President under his friend.

John Mitchell.

FACT -

The

government deliberately tried to push VVAW/Winter Soldier

Into violence during the conventions.

Yet, our demonstrations there-

as all of our activities were marked by a spirit of discipline and

unity. We stand on our record as a non-violent anti-war group.

FACT- Perhaps the most outrageous

aspect of the government's Gaines-

ville case is the attempt to make the public believe that a small group

of anti-war veterans would attack the Miami police, the Florida State

Highway Patrol, the National Guard, the 82nd Airborne Division and the

Marines with slingshots, crossbows

and fried marbles.

Rarely has the

government's contempt for the intelligence of the American people been

so clearly shown.

In order for the government to effectively disrupt the anti-war

movement, it was not essential for them to win in court. The conspiracy

laws make it possible for them to charge people when no crimes have

actually been committed. The government has cynically used these laws

to discredit their political opposition, to tie them up in lengthy

complex court proceedings, and to create. an atmosphere of paranoia in

the country.

Even when acquitted, defendants are kept from doing more

important work and their supporters are tied up in fund raising and

defense work.

Whatever the verdict, the government has already accom-

plished this with the Gainesville 8.

This case is different, however.

Since the Watergate disclosures, Nixon's cronies will fight like cor

nered rats to get a conviction in order to vindicate themselves and

to justify their subversion and distortion of justice. They cannot be

allowed to continue their lies and deceptions.

What

can be done? A local defense effort is underway.

In addition,

•there will be a week of nationally-aimed demonstrations in Gainesville

the week the trial starts.

Funds and assistance are needed.

If you

can help, contact the VVAW/Winter Soldier storefront at 363 Connecticut

or send donations to P.O. Box 902 Ellicott Station, Buffalo 14205.

is not the time for cynicism or apathy.

Gainesville may well be

the most important conspiracy case yet to be tried. Join the people's

conspiracy for the Gainesville 8 and commit the crime of spreading the

truth

12. CRITICISM:

A productive discussion was held concerning all delegates" lack of

responsibility towards: meeting schedules, host institutions, and

portions of the 10 objectives of VVAW/WSO.

Mike Mazetti and Bob Oeser were complimented for providing us with

Sat's supper and it was suggested that more collective efforts along

these

lines be urged at upcoming meetings.

Although the meeting was not heavily attended, sessions went smoothly

and much information was passed.'' Also, there was a cohesiveness not

always seen in the past.

SAILOR ACQUITTED IN SABOTAGE OF CARRIER:

San Francisco, June 12 - Pat Chenoweth, acqused by the Navy of com-

mitting $980, 000 of damage to the Ranger and delaying its departure

to Vietnam by three and a half months, was acquitted after a six

day court martial.

The evidence against Pat was hearsay and the

Navy had tried to hold the court martial in the Philipines to insure

a conviction.

Besides the

incident Pat was charged with, the pro-

ceedings revealed that two dozen other acts of sabotage took place

on the Ranger in a five month period of 1972. He was refused bail

from the beginning and spent ten and a half

months in the brig.

ADDITIONS TO GAINESVILLE FACT SHEETS

Fact - John Mitchell, when called upon to testify in pre-trial

hearings by the Gainesville defense, claimed he had no "recol-

Lection" of ever ordering wiretaps on the 8 defendants and

other VVAW/WSO members.

The judge would not allow the defense

to question him on any, other topic. Mitchell's supporters now

state that he's suffered two minor strokes recently and is

having a little trouble with his memory.

John's the one who

told reporters, after Nixon first took office, to "watch what

we do, not what we say."

We're watching,

Fact - The office of a Gainesville defense attorney was broken...

into last year.. as were

the offices of lawyers for the Harris-

burg defendants.

the Chicago Weatherman, the Black Panthers, the

plumbers and others, apparently by members of the White House!s

In another incident, a Gainesville defense lawyer,

flying to Florida, had his briefcase

"misplaced' after airline

officials refused to allow him to take it aboard the plane as

carry-on baggage.

A few days later, it was returned with its.

contents in a different order.

ATT INFORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Brothers & Sisters-

The next general meeting of VVAW/WSO is Saturday,

12 noon.

The place is the Storefront on 363 Connecticut Street.

you haven't seen the Storefront yet, this could be a good time.

where the

big black on white sign says "Vateran's Self-Help Center."

We need any feedback we can get as to whether or not you've been

getting these mailings on time for meetings and events.

We had the

picnic last month, and

a general meeting right after that, and we

found that 9 out of 10 members we talked to didn't get their mailing

until after at least the picnic. We got the mailing out on Tuesday A.M.

prior to the picnic on Sunday.

This has bèen happening more

and more.

Either the post office

is totally breaking down or our mail

is being

singled out and delayed. Let us. know how often, you get mailings,

when and whether you think yours might

have been tampered with.

A lot of members have, stated that they want to become more active

but can't always make the general meetings. Under the nore or less

autonomous committee structure we have now, you can work on a committee

that most closely reflects your interests.

Committees in need of people

are tund Raising; Veterans

Affairs; Community Action, Political Educa-

tion; and Amnesty/Anti-militarism.

We also need people willing to sell

"Winter Soldier", downtown in

the mornings.

And we also need people to

pitch in with some of the shitwork like mailings and correcting

addresses, etc. If you can work in any of these areas, contact s

and we'll put the right people in touch.

"Winter Soldier", the national VVAW/WSO 'paper is a monthly that's

in it's fifth issue now.

We haven't had the bread to send every local

member a copy, but we hope to soon.

Meanwhile, we have back copies of

every issue

at the storefront......

: The Attica Defense

Committee will 'be leading the community in a

• series of events to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of the Attica up

rising and massacre. The degree to which we will participate will

be discussed at the meeting.

Tentative schedule:

Sept. 9th, Sun. parties to celebrate takeover

Sept. 10, 11, 12- workshops in community. Possibly one to be

held

in the Storefront.

Sept. 13, Thurs.- mass demo and rally downtown.

Everyone is urged to participate as an individual and in whatever

organizational activity is decided upon.

Also, a VVAW/WSO national

coordinator may be in town then,

so it will be a good chance to get

a sense of the national strength

organ nation.

Film and Speaker: In conjunction with the activities planned for the

second anniversary of the Attica uprising, we will have a film about

Attica and one of the Attica Brothers will speak on what happened at

Attica as well as defense efforts being made on their behalf.

This

will be at the Storefront on Tuesday, Sept. 11 at 7:30.

Gainesville

About the biggest thing VVAW/WSO faced since the signing of the peace

accords last January has

; been the Gainesville 8 conspiracy trial.

Almost every mailing this year has said something about it. To many of

us,. though, they may still

this chapter were in Gainesville from July 30 to august 5 for the

national VVAW/WSO demonstrations and three of us got to spend a day in

court and hear the opening statements.

The demos were a little smaller than we'd hoped for, but we were all

impressed by the high degree of solidarity showed there and the unity

of purpose. VVAW/WSO, as recently as a year ago, wasn't much more

than a name a lot of vets adhered to. It described a

condition.

Now

it's really an organization.

Sometimes we feel a little isolated and

wonder what's coming down in this country and it would be good to re

member this.

We mentioned

"Winter Soldier" carlier in this newsletter.

That's new this year.

Another project is Operation County Fair.

VVAW/WSO members are helping to build a community medical clinic-

We could go on, but the point is we're no longer a loose handful of

people - we're. an

organization: that's growing and that's starting to

get into some serious activity.

Too often brothers and sisters aren't

aware of what's going on in the rest of the country. In future news-

letters, we'll try to include information: äbout some of these projects.

At 3:42 p.m. on November 10, 1975, Miss Helen W. Gandy

formerly the Secretary to the Director, telephonically advised me that she

had been called by Mary DeOreo who requested an interview at 3:00 p.m. '

on Tuesday, November 11, 1975, at Miss Gandy's apartment. Miss DeOreo

said that she would be accompanied by Mark Gitenstein and a court reporter.

She said that Miss DeOreo indicated that representatives of the FBI would not

be permitted to be present during the interview, however, she was not

concerned about that because she felt that she did not feel the need to have

anyone present and she did not desire to have counsel.

I advised Miss Gandy that she could consider the employment

Mr. Robert Wick, Vice President, Audits and Security,

Pan American World Airways, telephone number 212-973-6139, whose

office is located at Room 4512 in the Pan Am Building in New York City,

called at 3:19 p.m. on November 5, 1975. Mr. Wick said that he had been

called at 11:35 a.m. on October 31, 1975, by an individual identifying

himself as Mike Epstein representing the Senate Select Committee.

Epstein requested him to come to Washington for a two to three hour

interview concerning a matter relating to his "employment. " Epstein

did not further describe the subject matter of the interview. An appoint-

ment was arranged for 10:00 a.m. on November 7, 1975.

Mr. Wick said that he was uncertain as to the probable subject

matter of the interview because other matters coming within his responsibilities

at Pan Am which were unrelated to the FBI have been of recent interest to the

Committee. He asked that he be furnished with advice concerning this matter.

At my request, SA Daly telephonically contacted Epstein and

determined that the subject matter of the interview of Mr. Wick would be

"Martin Luther King, Jr."

I called Mr. Wick at 5:00 p.m. on November 5, 1975, and advised

him that we learned that the subject matter of the requested interview would

be 'Martin Luther King, Jr." I told Mr. Wick that under the arrangements

existing with the Senate Select Committee, it would be appropriate for me

to release him from his secrecy agreement with the FBI for the interview

requested by Epstein. I furher advised him of the need to avoid discussion

of matters that may pertain to pending investigations, information derived

This is to advise of the results of our meeting on this date

with Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC), members of the Committee's staff, and Department represen-

tatives, wherein these individuals were afforded a complete briefing

on our sensitive Solo intelligence operation and specifically as it

Irelates to our investigation of the late Martin Luther King, Jr.

Present at the meeting, in addition to Senator Church,

were William G. Miller, Staff Director of the SSC, and SSC staff

members John Elliff, Michael Epstein, and Mark Gitenstein.

Senator John Tower,

Vice-Chairman of the sse, was unable to attend

and John Bayly of his stati was designated by him as his representative

at the briefing.

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelli-

gence Coordination at the Department, and his deputy, Steven

Blackhurst, attended. In addition to myself, Inspector-Deputy

Assistant Director T. W. Leavitt and Supervisors Seymor:: F.

Phillips, Michael J. Steinbeck, and David Ryan of the Intelligence

Division attended. The meeting was held in Room S201 of the Capitol

which had previously been swept to counter possible elsur coverage.

The briefing commenced at 9:45 a.m. and although Senator Church

departed at 11:30 a. m. informal discussion continued for another

half-hour.

I commenced the briefing by furnishing the Senator and

SSC representatives a general overview of our Solo intelligence opera-

tion. I emphasized the extreme sensitivity and pointed out the

continuing value of thesgy lores to our intelligence responsiblities

and the national security interests. I summarized the highly-

valuable positive counterintelligence obtained through the operation

relating to the Soviet Union and other hostile communist countries

indicating the importance attached by the State Department and the

intelligence community to the information obtained through this

operation. A photograph depicting one of these sources in conference

with Soviet Communist Party Chairman Brezhnev was exhibited only

to the Senator. Although the names of the sources were not men-

tioned, I clearly pointed out that the information being disclosed

through this briefing could pinpoint the identity of the informants and,

if compromised, could be disastrous to our intelligence interests and

possibly result in personal jeopardy to the sources.

Inspector Leavitt briefly mentioned his recent meeting

with the sources and their concern for the security of their operations.

Supervisor Ryan furnished a general overview of the financial apparatus

of the Communist Party, USA, including its secret character, cover

company operations, and control by the soviets, tying this intorma-

tion into the relationship of the sensitive sources with Stanley David

Levison, the advisor to the late Martin Luther King, Jr.

Supervisor Phillips set forth in detail the relationship of Levison

and King, emphasizing our first-hand information received either

directly by the sources or through Lem Harris indicating King was

under the influence if not the control of secret Communist Party

member Levison. Supervisor Steinbeck advised of the continuing

liaison function of these sources between the Soviets and the Communist

Party, USA, Soviet funding of the Party through the informants and

also highlighted the sensitive nature of the operation. Many questions

of the SSC staff members were candidly answered.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Senator Church expressed appreciation for the thorough

briefing and stated he believed there was adequate basis for the FBI

to reasonably conclude certain advisors and close associates of King

were affiliated with the Communist Party and undoubtedly influencing

King. He expressed his belief it was the responsibility of the FBI to

determine the extent of communist or Soviet control or influence of

King, but that he was disturbed that in the course of this coverage an

attempt was made to publicly discredit King. He said he questioned

whether the FBI as a law enforcement agency was acting within its

proper scope in publicly discrediting King. He said it was his view

and concern that such activities placed the Bureau directly involved

in. the political process where it does not belong.

Senator Church stated he had viewed one FBI document

which indicated an effort within the FBI to cultivate a new responsible

leader of the black movement and he characterized this as political

involvement which he considered highly improper.

Senator Church stated he wished it was possible for the

American people to be aware of the extent to which the Soviets were

lunding the Communist Party, USA. He said this is something the

people should know and he regretted this could not be done under

circumstances which would not undermine the Bureau's work and

/responsibilities. He promised his Committee would be as protective

as possible regarding the sensitive information provided and that he

would insure that there would be no public hearings which would

Re: Senstudy 75

I reiterated the Director's concern regarding the security

of the sources and the operation and pointed out the extreme need-to-

know basis which this information is held within FBI. I advised

Senator Church that we had requested the meeting with him since

the Committee had raised questions as to the basis for an FBI inves-

tigation of King and from his comments it was felt we had accomplished

the purpose of the meeting--to show there were firm grounds for

opening the case. It was acknowledged that the Committee was con-

cerned with other issues relating to what was done during the

investigation and I was not prepared to address such issues at this

time. However, he could be assured of FBI cooperation in responding

to any questions to the best of our ability.

Homer A. Newman, Jr., relative to documents removed from

the office occupied by Mr. W.C. Sullivan at the time of

the termination of his duties with the FBI.

• This meeting was held pursuant to a request

previously received from the Committee to interview someone

knowledgeable concerning the material and/or documents which

were retrieved from Mr. Sullivan's office at the time of

his termination of service.

Mr. Epstein's inquiries were directed principally

toward obtaining information regarding the chain of custody

of this material from the time it was removed from Mr. Sullivan's

office to date. He was advised that although Mr. Deegan

has custody of this material he would not be in a position

to furnish information relative to the chain of custody with

out further research. In this connection it was suggested

to Mr. Epstein that he make his request in writing, which

lhe agreed to do.

He also inquired

as to whether or not this was the-

material in which the original of a letter was located that

had allegedly, from its face, been prepared to be utilized

in transmitting information and/or tapes regarding Rev. King

to Mrs. King. He was informed that this is the group of

documents in which this material had been located.

At his request Deputy Associate Director: James B. Adams

and SA Paul V. Daly of this Division met with Deputy Attorney Gen-

eral harold i. lyler, Ji., on October 3,

1975. Mr. Tyler advised

that he had shown former Attorney General. Nicholas deB. Katzenbach

the original Bureau memoranda captioned "Martin Luther King" dated

5/17/65, 10/19/65 and 12/12/65 pertaining to authorization for

microphone surveilance on Martin Luther King.

he was also shown a

note dated 12/10/65 directed from him to Mr. Hoover with his initials

affixed at the botton thereof. Mr. Tyler related that Katzenbach,

after reviewing the aforementioned documents,

stated that it was

doubtful that he had approved the microphone surveillances contained

in the memoranda, although he admitted the initials looked like his

own.

Katzenbach

advanced two arguments as to why he did not believe

he had approved the electronic surveillance requests.

(I) He stated the Martin Luther King investigation was a

very. controversial topic and he was very concerned about it.

Accord-

ing to Mr. Tyler, Katzenbach stated he was so concerned about this

natter that he had discussed it with the President.. In view of his

concern, Katzenbach

stated that if he had approved such requests for

electionic surveillance he would have certainly have recalled doing

so and he had no such recollection.

(2) Katzenbach stated it was not his policy to give •

after-the-fact approval to electronic surveillance requests. (Ihe

aforementioned memoranda were all requests for electronic surveil-

lance dated after the surveillance was utilized.) Katzenbach-in-

Formed Mx.. Tyler that he had reviewed his diary and on at least one •

of the occasions when electronic surveillance was used, he was avail-

able to ayprove prior to the use of the device and, therefore,

there

would have been no need for after-the-fact ratification of the

electronic surveillance.

RE:

SENSTUDY. 75

Katzenbach, according to Mr. lyler, was shown the

Xeroxes of the atorementioned documents by the senate select

Committee during interview by that Committee apparently per-

taining to his authorization of electronic surveillance.on

Martin Luther King.

It was.

pointed out by Mr. Adams that former Attorney

General Katzenbach in a memorandum dated 9/27/65 captioned•

"Special Investigative Techniques" that he stated, in part,.

concerning wiretaps and microphones "It is my understanding

that such devices will not be used without my authorization,

• although in emergency circumstances they may be used subject.

to my lates ratification."

Mx. Tyler stated that Katzenbach had. not mentioned this

particular communication and that he, Tyler, did not know that such -

a communication existed. Mr. Tyler stated that he and the Attorney

General had indicated to Katzenbach that in order to clear up this.

question it would probably be necessary that he submit to interview

and that certain investigations be conducted: Mr. Tyler mentioned

particularly that handwriting examinations might be necessary to

verify the authenticity of the initials affixed to the documents

in question. Mr. Tyler stated he would send the Bureau a memorandum

requesting a certain investigation to clarify this question.

RIGHTS SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE

ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS, REQUEST FOR

TESTIMONY OF JOE R.

CRAIG

Senstikely-75

Нотір

During the course of a contact on another matter with

Congressman Jack Brooks, Chairman of the Government Operations

Committee, he advised that he had seen Mr. Kelley's letter to

Chairwoman Abzug regarding the proposed testimony of Joe R. Craig

in which the Director indicated he could not grant the request for testimony.

Congressman Brooks described this as nonsense and said that the Director

is treading on dangerous grounds because he in effect is defying a Committee

of Congress. He said it would be different if the FBi was investigating

Craig on a criminal matter because in that case the Congress would

back off. He said that if he had received such a letter, he would likely

call the Director to testify.

When I learned of this contact, I made arrangements to speak

with Congressman Brooks and he returned my call at 5:00 p,m. on

October 23, 1975. I told Congressman Brooks that I wanted to be sure

he understood the true circumstances and I explained to him that the

Criminal Division of the Department of Justice was conducting an inquiry

concerning the matters about which Mr. Craig was called to testify and

that the FBI was not conducting the inquiry. I further explained that

because of the Criminal Division inquiry, the Bureau had been advised by the

Department that the Attorney General's policy was that where the subject matter

of the testimony pertains to a matter under active investigation by the Criminal

Division of the Department, requests for testimony should be declined.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Government Information and Individual Rights

...

' Subcommittee, etc.

-:

Congressman Brooks said that he misunderstood the

circumstances when he saw the letter addressed to Mrs. Abzug. He

said he did not have a copy of the letter, but had only read it. He said

that the Department should assume the responsibility for declining to

provide witnesses called by Committees of Congress if the declination

Is based on Department policy. He said that the Committee would then

deal directly with the Attorney General.

Congressman Brooks said that even should the Attorney

General instruct witnesses specifically not to appear, the Committee would

still insist on their appearance unless the individual was under indictment

or unless a criminal case was actually pending.

i.:

(".

Congressman Brooks asked me if we had explained to

Mrs. Abzug the circumstances of the Criminal Division inquiry and the

consequent restrictions on the FBI due to Department policy. I told him

that we had called Mrs. Abzug last evening, October 22, 1975, and explained

the circumstances to her. Congressman Brooks said that he would discuss

this matter with Mrs. Abzug but he felt that the subpoenas requested by her

subcommittee would be approved and issued for the appearance of Mr. Craig.

This is a foliow-up to my letter to you of November

public hearings on the FBI's use of intormants and sources

:

in the intelligence area.

The date for that hearing is now scheduled for

Tuesday, December 2, 1975, rather than December 4 and 5, as

indicated earlier.

tion to the appearance that we have discussed with Bureau

representatives of three former FBI informants (Rowe, Hardy,

and Cook) and Bureau representatives (who would discuss the

overall Bureau use of informants), we are planning to hear

testimony from the handling agents and other FBI field per-

sonnel involved with the three former informants indicated

above.

My letter of November 7 requested these field person

nel be made available for interviews and possible depositions

and I understand the necessary clearances and procedures

are

nearing completion for this.

Also enclosed is a supplementary request for docu-

ments pertaining to one of the former FBI informants scheduled

to testify.

Dear Bill:

Enclosed are several documents referred to by Mr. 'Colson

and myself in the course of his recent sworn deposition at your

office.

In each case, what is provided is a typed version

of my rough handwritten notes. Those notes were prepared by

me approximately a year ago, when I was given access to the

underlying documents by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force

in the course of pretrial discovery in United States v. Ehrlich-

man, et. al

The documents are as follows:

1.

Several FBI memos and reports concerning Leonard

The text of the first report (dated July 6,

1971) indicates that derogatory information about Mr.

Boudin had been furnished by the FBI to Ray McHugh

Although I do not have

copy, there exists in Mr. Colson's White House files

a memorandum from John Dean to Charles Colson, dated

July 20, 1971, transmitting to Colson a copy of McHugh's

article.

As you know, Mr. Colson served seven months

In prison for furnishing to Jerry tertlorst a report on

Mx. Boudin prepared by Howard Hunt from these FBI

materials.

Attached letter to the Attorney General responds

to request received from Department, dated 10/17/75, with

reference to a letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairman,

Senate Select Committee (SSC), to the Attorney General,

dated 10/15/75 (copy also attached). Senator Church's

letter, in summary, proposes that SSC Staff conduct interviews

with nine FBI confidential sources in connection with

activities of the sources on behalf of the FBI in our

„COINTELPRO operations. The senator indicated to the Attorney

General that he hoped there would be no objection to such

interviews but if objections were evident he desired to be

"contacted by Tuesday, 10/21/75.

This is not a new issue. During August, 1975,

SSC Staff Member John I. Elliff proposed interviews of this

type which were objected to on the principle of the FBI's

obligation to protect the confidentiality of our relationshi

with any source whether that confidentiality be implied or

expressed.

The Director, at that time, strongly supported

this principle of confidentiality and the issue was taken do

the Attorney General. At a conference between the Attorney

General and Senator Church on the evening of 8/14/75, it was

agreed that the Committee would attempt a limited number of

interviews of individuals whose identities and/or relationship

with the FBI had been protected.

However, as a condition

precedent to such interviews, the FBI was to be allowed to

contact such individuals to inform them of the proposed

• interview and to determine whether each would be receptive

Mansto such an interview. Senator Church concurred in this

arrangement; however,

subsequently on 8/18/75, Elliff advised

that Senator Church

had reconsidered his agreement with

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Attorney General to the aforementioned procedures as a result

of persuasion by SSC Staff. Elliff, at that time, indicated

a letter recording Senator Church's change of attitude had

been drafted. To date, no such formal acknowledgement has

been received and no interviews have been attempted in the

interim.

By his most recent communication, 10/15/75, Senator

Church again raises this issue. Although he does note that

the matter was originally discussed with the Attorney General

"some weeks ago," he makes no mention of the agreement with

the Attorney General at that time. Apparently, as some sort

of precedent, he does cite the fact that the FBI did make

available for use and interview the names of Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) personnel who coopénated with the FBI in

certain COINTELPRO actiVities. We do not consider this action

on our part to be a concession with respect to confidentiality

of sources since we specifically stipulated that we considered

IRS personnel to be U. S. Government officials acting in their

capacity as such.,

OBSERVATIONS:

Obviously, the SSC has not given up on this issue.

It is just as obvious that no valid issues have arisen which

should cause us to modity the position taken by the Director

and the Attorney General concerning the confidentiality,

implied or expressed, of our relationships with sources

cooperating with the FBI.

ALI INFÖPILATION CONTAINED

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

MILLE

The Select Committee is presently investigating the

activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried

on as part of the COINTELPRO program.

We appreciate the

cooperation of the FBI and the Justice Department in

making materials available to us in this area.

However,

one problen remains to be resolved. The Committee believes

its staff must contact and interview certain persons who

received information fron the FBI in the course: of:

The FBI has withheld the names of

such persons from the Committee's use on the grounds that

they were FBI "sources"

The Committee wishes to stress that it is not inter-

ested in questioning these persons about any role as a

"source"

, but rather as a recipient of information from

the FBI.

Indeed, in many instances we would not have been

excre thahe

aware that the individual was a "source" had not the FRI

excised the name from the materials delivered to us.

Nevertheless, to minimize any incidental. deleterious effects

on legitimate FBI operations, the Committee has selected

very limited number of persons whom we desire to contact

and interview. (See attached list and materials.)

As you will recall, we originally discussed this

matter with you some weeks age.

Since then the Committee

has had an opportunity to consider the issue more fully in

the light of our experience with other investigations. For

need to use the names of IPS personnel who cooperated with

the FBI in certain COINTELPRO activities.

Those names

were made available to us for our use.

As I am sure you can appreciate, what is at stake

here is the investigation of serious breaches of the

security and confidentiality of information obtained by

Such information was apparently disclosed or

"leaked" for the purpose of disruption.

The full extent

of such disclosures in many of the cases, such as the

efforts to discredit DI. Martin Luther King, JI., is still

unknown.

Surely, it would be incongruous for an inquiry

into these matters to be impaired on the grounds of the

FBI's interest in preserving confidentiality.

The Conmittee has a clear mandate and a firm commit-

ment to investigate allegations that the FBI attempted

to

harass and discredit individuals.

The integrity of this

investigation depends upon our ability to conduct inter-

views without the appearance of outside interference.

Therefore, we hope you have no objection to our conducting

the interviews of the persons on the attached list, but if

you do, please contact me by Tuesday, October 21.

ncerely.,

At 5:10 p.m. on Odober 28, 1975, Paul E. Ertzinger, of the

Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, telephonically advised

me that he is working with a group designated by the current President

of the Society to provide cooperation with the Bureau in cases in which

former employees require legal representation in matters rising out

of their former employment in the Bureau. He requested, and I explained

to him, the interim procedures now being followed in the Department

concerning requests for counsel by employees or former employees. In

short, I told him that should a formèr employee desire the appointment

of counsel he should communicate that request to me and the matter would

be referred to the Department following a review at FBI Headquarters.

He was told that referral to the Department would be given in-

cases in which it appeared that the subject matter pertained to an activity

of the former employee that was within the scope of his employment in the

FBI. I advised Mr. Ertzinger of the need for a list of the names of those

attorneys known to the Society who would be willing to serve as counsel

if requested and appointed, and he agreed to furnish me with such names.

Mr. Ertzinger said that he would be attending the annual

convention of the Society in Houston and that he would discuss these

matters with the President and other officers and make known to them

the interim procedures being followed.

ALI INFORVATION CONTAINED

DATE 1-50/

MDRIS

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I would like to bring to your personal attention

a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to

establish the relevant facts with respect to one of the

areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inguiry.

pursuant to S. Res. 21.

I have been informed by the staff that numerous

materials

which have been requested during the past several

weeks which pertain to the. ibi's activities witn respect to

Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., have been withheld from the.

Committee by the Department because of concern expressed

by Mix. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and

estate, as to the appropriateness of the Department's

"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations

«monitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King.

Upon reviewing the lists of materials

requested,

I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could

conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,

especially in view of the fact that our letters of request

have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-

cripts should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to

place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all.of

the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King

natest 2427, 1964 memorance which pertain ele

august 24 - 21

Democratic National Convention, and (2) those portions of any

other requested materials which actually summarize or quote

from conversations monitored during any acrone surven

ance of Dr. KIng:

Bureau, January, 1941 - January, 1975, offices of

assignment,

and dates thereof with, seemingly, emphasis on specific dutles

while assigned the New York Office (NYO), October, 1946 -

July, 1960.

Mail Intercepts

Dick asked a serles of questions regarding my

knowledge of mail intercept operations while assigned the

NO.

I responded that I was in no wey involved with any such

operations and had no personal knowledge regarding such

¿activity while so assigned. Following background inquiries

regarding Joseph Schmit as head of the NYO Intelligence

Division and SA John Donahy's assignment as supervisor of e

Soviet section, he asked if I

had been present of participated

in a briefing of then Attorney General Robert Kennedy at the

No with regerd to the interception of mail. I pointed out

that I was not assigned the NYO during Kennedy's term as

Attorney General, having been assigned Bureau Headquarters

in July, 1960; that therefore I was not present or knowledgeable

concerning such briefing.. I explained that I had met Robert

Kennedy, briefly and socially, in a reception line at

Washington, D. C., in 1962, and on no other occasion.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE:

INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI. SA BY SSE

Dick asked if during the time I was supervising

Intelligence Sections in the NYO were such sections engaged

in mail intercepts. I responded that they were not.

Dick asked if at any time from 1960 on was I aware

of mail intercepts on the part of the NYO or elsewhere.

He was advised that I became aware of such activity indirectly

through a Bureau memorandum and a specific sensitive

investigative matter. Dick did not further pursue this matter:

Watch Lists/NSAI

In response to questions, Dick was advised that I

was unable to state when the practice of Watch Lists, or

name checks at the NSA originated; that the nemes were

determined by the supervisory case Agent on a selective basis,

that is whether or not the individual traveled or had contacts

abroad of, in fact, resided abroad and was of interest from

a foreign or counterintelligence standpoint.

Such requests for

a check could be made by periodically submitting a list,

supplemental individual requests, or by telephone if time

was

_ a consideration. Lists or recuests could be transmitted

toUSA by courier, liaison, telephone, and teletype. NSA -

did not mount any overt action of programs responsive to such

lists or checks, but provided data on hand or as it became

available Meetings were held on occasions between FBI and

NSA personnel for the purpose of acquainting such personnel as

to the Bureau's desires and NSA capabilities.

Dick asked if the Bureau

was in a position to provide

a Watch List that was in effect at a given time and was

advised that from experience this would not be possible, nor

would a review of case files

supply such information since

the procedure was not formalized to that extent.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITILS (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER EBI SA BY SSC

Dick was advised that the bulk of data received

from NSA was provided on a determination by NSA that it would

be of FBI interest rather than in response to a specific

FBI request; that NSA was selective concerning the deta

provided, realizing the FBI

was not equipped, manpower-wise,

or in communications areas to absorb the voluminous distribution

by NSA to other agencies: Central Intelligence Agency,

Defense Intelligence Agency, etc., and was primarily responsible

and interested only in deta of security or counterintelligence

value.

Dick was advised that data received from NSA of

a comminications intelligence nature and so classified

would not appear in an investigative case file, but received

special handling. Much of such data was destroyed following

an evaluation by the desk supervisor, and it retained, was

maintained in a special file room under stringent access

controls.

Regarding the Watch Lists, Dick asked if the Bureau

submitted any lists to NSA or made any requests subsequent

to Attorney General Richardson's letter instructing that no

such requests be made of NSA without Department approval.

He was advised that I knew of no such requests and that NSA

had been advised by the Bureau regarding Richardson's letter.

Dick asked if I knew of any instance where U. S.

citizens may have appeared on such lists.

I advised that I

could not recall, but speculated that it would be logical

for Black Panthers headquertered in Algeria to be on the list

or known terrorists traveling or residing abroad since the

FBI did have the responsibility for determining any foreign

direction, control or financing of domestic individuals or

organizations.

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

I want you to know how much I appreciated the '

opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other

day about the Martin Luther King, JI. case.

It was most

helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-

cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you

that we will do everything possible to avoid joepardizing

any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific

items set forth in earlier document requests which would

presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion

as of

various

dates in 1962, 1963 and 1964 that Stanley

Levison was a "secret member of the Communist Party, USA.".

Of course in the event that there is no particular document

in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to

the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know

so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that

which appear to have been the articulated predicates

for the "cominfil" case.

Once

again, I want to thank you for your time and

I look forward

to hearing from you father on this subjack.

singerely,

to make the following requests.

As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-

vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence

informant and source program that could be inserted in

the record of

the testimony of Bureau representatives at

the hearing.

This memorandum would enable the Bureau to

present to the Select Committee a complete description

of its program and to discuss the issues of particular

interest to the Committee members. These include, for

example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,

including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-

ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the

intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal

informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group; and

3) the program's command and control system, including the

limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant or source is per-

mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-

DRIE

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memorandum,

11/5/75, advised that Wick, a vice president of Pan American

World Airways in New York City, was in telephonic touch

with Mr. Mintz concerning a telephone call Wick had received

from Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Member Michael

Epstein at which time Epstein requested Wick's presence

in Washington, D. C., for a Staff interview. The memorandum

relates that Epstein told Wick the interview concerned a

matter relating to Wick's employment and that Epstein did

not further describe the subject matter of the interview.

Wick was uncertain as to:the possible subject matter and

asked Mr. Mintz's advice. It was then determined by

Supervisor P. V. Daly of Mr. Mintz's office that the subject

matter was Martin Luther King, JI. Daly determined this

by telephoning Epstein.

Wick telephoned Phillips 11/6/75 seeking information

relating to the procedures for the interview, Wick indicating

that he was planning to come to Washington, D. C., for

nterview by Epstein ax 10i00 a.m., 11/7/75,

questions outside the scope of the indicated subject matter

because the subject matter was all he was cleared from

his confidentiality agreement with the FBI for discussion.

le was also told of the four general privileged areas

concerning which he did not have to answer questions, such

as information relating to sensitive investigative techniques,

information which might identify confidential sources, etc.

Wick offered to mail to the Bureau a statement concerning

the interview and he was thanked by Phillips for this.

Wick made it a point to advise Phillips that he

was rather annoyed at Epstein's approach to him, particularly

that Wick had tried on more than one occasion during the

telephone conversation with Epstein to pry from Epstein the

subject matter of the interview but Epstein persisted in not

advising him.

Daly has advised that, when he called Epstein at

Mr. Mintz's behest, he asked Epstein why he did not tell

Wick the subject matter of the interview and Epstein's reply

was that Wick had not asked him. (It should be noted that,

when Daly had the conversation with Epstein, it was before

Wick's call to Phillips.)

OBSERVATIONS:

The foregoing represents two improprieties on the

part of Epstein. The first concerns the fact that, contrary

to agreed-upon procedures, he contacted Wick prior

to advising

the Bureau of his intention to interview Wick. The second

concerns divergent reports to us on the Wick-Epstein conver-

sation. Wick made it absolutely clear that he pressed

Epstein for specificity as to the subject matter of the

interview and Epstein refused to tell him. Epstein claims

he was not asked by Wick. It is the personal observation

of Phillips that, if he had to choose who to believe, there

is no doubt but that it is Wick.

None.

Senator Church:

Serstudy -75

I feel it my duty as a citizen of this

country to express my

feelings to you about your Senate Intelligence Operations

committee. p

I firmly believe in the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. and think that they

should do whatever they think nessasary to stop the spread of

crime and subversion by outside powers.

M

If they think that I'm a part of something that is against the

United

States then

I want them to open my mail or tap my phones

until they're convinced one way or the other about my activitys.

These two organizations, F.B.I. and CiI.A., were not formed to

deal with ANGELS so they shouldn't be expected to act like INGELs.

I strongly believe that you and your conmittce are wrong and hurting i

the fight that is so important to our country.

• I urge you to read Ronald Reagans "Viewpoint" October 22, 1975

"The Communist Conspiracy Parts 1 and 2".

This I feel will give

you a better idea about how your committee is hurting our country.

In closing let me say that I do not like form letters....they just

waste government money.

During the morning of October

received

a telephone call from an individual who reported himself

as John Lofton, a syndicated writer. Mr. Lofton also

stated he was a friend öf Assistant Director Donald Moore

and I could check his, Mr. Lofton's, credentials with

Moore.

Mr. Lofton stated that he had been provided a

memorandum which had been prepared for Senator Church

apparently by Mr. William Miller, Staff Director of the

Senate Select Committee.

According to Mr. Lotton,

memorandum reported the details of a briefing by Mr. Wannall

and myself which had been provided representatives of the

Select Committee Staff concerning Soviet and Soviet-bloc

activities on Capitol Hill. Mr. Lofton stated that the

memorandum did not back up

the statements made by Senator

Goldwater that the Soviets had infiltrated seven to nine

Senate staffs.

According to Mr. Lofton he had first

Mr. Lofton then referred to statements which

he attributed to Alsop that the FBI was not permitted

to go on Capitol Hill

and that Capitol Hill was there-

fore a safe haven for espionage agents. I referred

Mr. Lofton to statements made by Director Kelley

and

Assistant Director Wannall before the seminar of the

Mr. Lofton subsequently did contact Assistant

Director Moore at which time he again explained that he

had access to a memorandum prepared for Senator Church

by his staff which recounted the details of a briefing

that had been afforded by the FBI to staff members

concerning the FBI's knowledge of the Soviet intiltration

If you agree, there is an attached memorandum

to the Deputy Attorney

• General concerning the contact

made by John Lofton and his statements that he had access

to a memorandum prepared for Senator Church by members of

his staff concerning a briefing which had been given by

representatives of the FBI.

It is noted that portions of

this briefing were classified. It is not known whether

the memorandum prepared for Senator Church contained this

classified information.

We should advise the Deputy Attorney

unless requested by him, we will make no further inquiries

seguent to 6/17/72, the date of the DNCH burglary. He also advised

break-in was acquired after 6/17/72 as was his knowledge of the

Republican Party buying large quantities of security equipment.

Mr. Gary H. Baise

Associate Deputy Attorney General

Room 4208, Department of Justice

Washington, D.G. 20530

Dear Mr. Baise:

I am writing to request from the Department all files within the

possession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which relate

in aay way to A. J Woolston-Smith. As I mentioned in our recent

conversation, it is of vital importance that we obtain this information

as

soon as possible because of our pending interview with Mr. Smith.

As you may recall from our previous discussions, I indicated two

specific time sequences wherein it has been established that the

Bureau received reports regarding Mr. Smith. The firsi of these

is in December 1954 when Smith's name came up in a CIA related

matter in Boston, Massachusetts. The second is on October 6, 1972

when a representative of a foreign nation's intelligence service

provided the FBI with a report on certain activities of Smith.. In

addition to these two specific dates and reports, however, we are

requesting the entire file or files possessed by the EBI on Mr. Smith.

Thanks again for your continied assistance and cooperation.

NY 105-109042-3-92 contains an article from the

New York Post issue of 6/30/70 in which SEGARRA waS rE-

ported to have been appointed as an assistant to the ARTHUR

GOLDBERG for Governor campaign. The article related that

SEGARRA was a former aid to Mayor LINDSAY and that SEGARRA

left the Lindsay Administration after a dispute in which

SEGARRA sided with the ILP during the takeover of a Harlem

church in December of 1969. This information was furnished

He stated

his son then telephonically contacted Smith, who Dr. Casolaro

deducted from his knowledge of the above meeting

STATEMENT OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM A. BRANIGAN,

REGARDING INTERVINY WITH A STAFF MEMBER OF THE

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

On October 9, 1975, Special Agent William A, Branigan

was interviewed by Mr. James

Dick, Staif Member of the U.S.

Senate Select Conmittee on Intellige:ce Activities.

The

interview, which took place in the office space of

the

U,S. Senate, was fully recorded and lasted from approximately

2:15 p.m. until 5:15 p.m.

At the outset of the interview, Mr. Dick advised

that it was his intention to have an oath administered by

a United States Senator but none such was available.

He advised that SA Branigan would be given the opportunity

to review the record of the interview, and he requested that

SA. Branigan at that time sweär an oath before a United States

Senator who would then be available.

SA Branigan agreed to

do this.

Also at the outset of the

hearing, Mr. Dick advised

SA Branigan that it was his right to refuse to answer any

question, that he had the right to counsel, and that at any

time could interrupt the interview for the

purpose of consulting

counsel.

M7'. Dick furnished SA Branigan with Xerox copies

of approximately eleven intra-Bureau documents which Mr. Dick

said had been made available to the Committee through the

Departnent of Justice.

During the interview a number of these

documents vere made a part of the record."

Mr. Dick requested

that SA Branigan identify and

briefly explain the Bureau's various mail intercept surveys.

When this was accomplished, Mr. Dick directed specific questions

at our survey known as 7 Coverage.

In answer to his specific

question, Nr. Dick was advised Z Coverage was instituted in

Washington,

D. C.,

prior to the United States entry into

World War II. Mx. Dick exhibited

a memorandum which had been

prepared by former Special Agent E. T. Turner in the mid-1950s

which dealt with a request by the Washington Field Office to

• renew the Z Coverage mail program. Mr. Dict was advised that

this memorandum obviously reflected that Z Coverage had been

discontinued at a date sometime before the date of the

memorandum and the program was reinstituted sometime after the

memorandum

present recollection as to the specific dates involved.

program had been extended to New York and that mail directed

to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations was the object of

our Z Coverage there.

Mr. Dick inquired if at any time during

the operation

of the I Coverage there was any thought

given to legalizing

the coverage.

Mr. Branigan advised that he had no recollection

of any such effort in this respect.

Mr. Dick also inquired

as to the criteria which were used by the Agents who worked

the Z Coverage in selecting mail for special attention.

He was advised that there were no written criteria, and it was

the recollection of SA Branigan that the Agents who worked the

Z Coverage used their own judgment based upon past experience

developed over an extended period of time im selecting mail

for special attention.

With respect to the Sam Survey, Mir. Dick was advised

that operations under

the Sam Survey were undertaken to locate

and identify Soviet illegals operating in the United States.

These operations were begun based on solid knowledge as to how

Soviet illegals were instructed to prepare their correspondence

"for transmittal to mail-drop locations in Western Europe.

Communications of illegal agents had telltale indicators, both

in the envelopes and the letters themselves, and these indicators

were believed to be still valid and in use by Soviet illegals

at the present time.

Mr. Dick was also informed that mail

selected for special attention would have more than one

indicator unless, of course, it was addressed to a known

mail-drop address in Europe.

Mr. Dick had available a letter

from our New York Office which set forth the results and the

accomplishments of the Sam Survey for a particular period.

Mr. Dick referred specifically to information set forth in the

da specificates inton

letter concerning the activities of some New Left groups.

He inquired to know why correspondence from these groups was

selected for special attention

if our program was directed at

2

## Page 264

SECRET

uncovering Soviet illegals.

SA Branigan informed Mr. Dick

that he did not know why this correspondence had been selected

and speculated that the Agents operating the program might

have been aware of the Bureau's investigative interest in these

groups and based upon this awareness had selected the correspondence

in the hope of furthering the investigation of the groups.

Mr. Dick inquired as to SA Branigan's evaluation of the Sam

survey, and he was advised that this survey was considered highly

productive in that it put the Bureau in a position oi identilying

Soviet illegals in the United States without reference to any

other agency or any other source both within and without the

Soviet intelligence services.

Mr. Dick inquired concerning the Sun Survey which

• involved the

screening of mail directed to known Soviet intelli

gence agents who were employed by the United Nations Secretariat.

Mr. Dick was advised that this program was again directed at

the detection of illegal agents who might be operating in the

United States.

on indicators which would

appear in the

illegals' correspondence.

Nr. Dick was informed

that we had not detected any illegals by this program and it

was of limited duration.

During the interview, Mr. Dick asked a number of

questions concerning the level

of authority for approval of

mail intercept surveys. He inquired if Mr. Hoover had approved

the original memorandum in the

Sam Survey.

Mr. Dick was advised

that based upon W. A. Branigan's review of the file, it did not

appear that this original memorandum had gone to the Director but

certainly subsequent mail that periodically evaluated the program

had been seen and approved by Mr. Hoover.

Mx. Dick was also

advised that it was Nr. Branigan's understanding that if a field

office desired to engage in a mail intercept survey, Bureau

Headquarters approval would be necessary.

Mr. Dick had available

a communication from our San Francisco Office which indicated that

office had developed a source who had access to mail coming from

Communist China through Canada. It was pointed out to Mr. Dick

that while this source may have been developed by the San Francisco

Office on their own initiative, Bureau Headquarters was consulted

and had issued guidelines concerning material reported by the

source.

Mr. Dick asked a number of questions concerning mail

programs directed against mail coming from and going to Communist

China. For the most part, SA Branigan was not familiar with

these programs and was unable to provide positive answers to

the questions posed.

CRET

With respect to Bureau Source

200, also known as

the CIA's Hunter Project, Mr. Dick inquired why the Bureau's

participation in this was not terminated at the time

Mr. Hoover terminated our other mail intercept surveys.

In this regard, SA Branigan advised him that obviously the

Bureau Source 200 Program was not considered in the same

light as the Sam Survey and the other programs.

With respect

to Bureau Source 200, the Bureau was merely a recipient of

information provided

by another agency, namely, the CIA.

Mr. Dick exhibited a memorandum prepared by SA Branigan

to

advise then Acting Director Gray that the CIA was proposing

that the Bureau take over the Hunter Project.

In answer to

Mr. Dick's question, he was advised that the Bureau certainly

never seriously considered taking over the Project because

of its magnitude, the number of personnel that would be

required to operate the program, and because the CIA themselves

had indicated that the Postal Service feared that there was

a serious threat to the security of the program. Mr. Dick

inquired as to whether the Bureau considered the product from

the Hunter Project as valuable as our Sam Survey.

He was

advised that certainly there was no comparison between the

results of the Hunter Project and the results that came from

the Sam Survey.

entitled to be represented by counsel, could refuse to ba

interviewed and could refuse to answer any questions.

SA Lee

was placed under oath by the stenographer who is a Notary Public

in the District of Columbia since no senator was present.

Mr. Dick advised that when the testimony was transcribed,

could be reviewed by SA Lee and minor changes made but any major

changes would have to be approved by a senator. ALso at that

time, 11 the bureau so desired, sA lee could be sworn in by a

senator.

The questions covered a discussion of the SAM and

GUS Survey programs operated by the FBI (Burean) between 1958

and 1966; the lunter Project (ureau Informant 200), which was

a CIA program operated until May 1973; and Z Coverage operated

by the Bureau between 1940 and 1966-

With regard to the SAM Survey, Dick asked when it was

initiated and when it was stopped.

He was furnished with these

dates: 1958 through July, 1966.

He noted that one of the items

in his possession, a New York letter dated April 8, 1966,

pointed out that the

Mr. Dick asked what action would be taken if the SAM

Survey developed information showing a violation of criminal

law within our jurisdiction. He was told it probably would have

to be referred to the Division in the FBI handling the criminal

violation involved with all the safeguards against disclosure

of the source and limitation on the use of material explained.

he was told that in the recollection of sA lee, no such intorma-

tion was ever developed.

Mr. Dick asked if justification of the programs was

ever done on a basis less than annual review. He was told on

certain occasions we did if Mr. Hoover or another Bureau

official asked for such a review on a shorter basis..

Mr. Dick made inquiry concerning the origin of the

SAM Survey program and asked if Mr. Hoover was aware of it.

He

was told that the program originated in a conference held with

personnel from some of our field offices, including th

New York Office, and FBIHQ personnel. During this conference,

it was

agreed to begin the sAM survey program and this was

placed

in a memorandum reporting the results of the conference

to Mr. Hoover along with the recommendation of the conference

to begin the program.

This memorandum was approved by Mr. Hoover.

Mr. Dick asked the reasons for the discontinuance of the program

in July, 1966, particularly since Mr. Hoover had approved the

continuation of the program for a year in the New York Office

and Washington Field Office in April, 1966. Mr. Dick was told

that the reason Mr. Hoover made this decision was not known.

Mr. Dick asked about the GUS Survey and he was told

it involved a review of mail destined for certain postal zones

in New York, Detroit and San Francisco.

He was told it was

based on knowledge gained from our work that we could identify

mail directed to

illegals through indicators we knew were used

by Soviet intelligence officers in commnicating with illegals.

He was told we were looking for mail posted in the United States

15 an Illegal. The reavon for the selection of certain postal

in the New York or Washington, D. C.,

area, and directed

zones was based on the fact that the areas were the type in which

an illegal may live; that is, a transient-type population with

hotels, boarding and rooming

houses which attract someone

trying to establish himseli

in the United States.

Mr. Dick was

told in response to a question concerning the indicators that

they were still considered to be valid.

Concerning Z Coverage,

Mt. Dick pointed out a memorandum

had been prepared in September,

1951, discussing the possibilities

of opening the mail legally.

Mr. Dick asked SA Lee whether

any further action had been taken on this matter and he was told

SA Lee had no such knowledge.

Mr. Dick asked for the criteria

used in & Coverage and he was told this was something which

was left to the judgment of the individual Agent who reviewed

mail and that the Agent would develop a

and would ignore mail obviously prepared by children or which

appeared to be of a routine business nature. He asked if

SA Lee handled the supervision of this case and was told it

was handled in another unit and that it had commenced in 1940

which was prior to the time SA lee entered on duty with the

Bureau.

Concerning the Hunter Project, Mr. Dick asked how

information concerning American citizens traveling in Russia

or studying in Russia would be of assistance in locating illegals.

It was pointed out that such individuals could have possibly

been engaged in activities

in the Soviet Union which caused

them to be compromised and might have been recruited on the

basis of such compromise.

In addition, American students

studying at schools such as Patrice Lumumba University may well

have been recruited by Soviet intelligence.

were included

Mr. Dick asked why the names of certain individuals

were included on the Hunter Watch List, He specifically

referred to the name Leonard Bernstein.

SA Lee informed him

he had no Information conceming Bernstein or why his name

was included on the Watch List.

Mr. Dick asked about the details of the offer made

official to see Mr. L. Patrick Gray III concerning this but no

information was received that the meeting had taken place and,

if so, what transpired.

He asked what the feeling of

SA Lee was concerning this offer and it was pointed out that

CIA had informed us there were security problems involved and

for this reason the opinion of SA lee was that it might not

be wise to take over the project. He asked if SA Lee thought

the programs should be reinstituted and he was told that in

Light of its questionable legality, reinstitution would be

questionable.

He then asked if the answer would be the same if

the Attorney General approved the reinstitution ot the programs

and SA Lee stated that he would favor reinstitution of the

programs under those circumstances since it was believed they
