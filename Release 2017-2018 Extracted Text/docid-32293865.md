e Miam letter to the Bureau January 13, 1954, with copie

to Havana. MINN

Concerning the Miami informant's allegation about the Sevilla-

Biltmore Hotel trying to get a gambling casino permit, it is believed

that this information may be true, although this office has no definite

information to corroborate it. Two or three years ago, AMTETTO BATTISTI

leased the Sevilla-Biltmore to a Chicago group and one WILLIAM HOGAN came

to Havana as Manager of the hotel.

HOGAN died at the hotel about three

or four months ago and the management was taken over by one SOT SIMON, ILL.

also out of Chicago, 00(G/U)

Havana PCI

who is connected with the gambling

casino in the Tropicana night club, advised some time ago that SIMON

was encouraging Havana street prostitutes, of which there are many in

the downtown area where the Sevilla is located, to frequent the Sevilla

bar and endeavor to make pickups there.

It would seem logical that SIMON

might try to go one step further and establish a casino in the hotel,

although it is believed that he would have much difficulty in obtaining

a permit due to opposition on the part of other casinos.

With regard to MEYERALANSKY, the Bureau was advised that LANSKY

owned a part of the gambling concession at the Montmartre night club in

downtown Havana during the 1952-1953 season. It has not been possible to

deternine whether IANSKY is participating at the Montmartre this season w

The ANDRES MAURICIC

HEILER mentioned by the informant is be- 7

lieved to be identical with ANDRES HEILER mentioned in Havana letter to

the Bureau dated June 10, 1952, in the case entitled "UNKNOWN SUBJECTS,

Reason

Theft of $120,000.00 Worth of U. S. Treasury Bonds From First of Boston

Corporation, New York, New York, November 21, 1951, ITSP."

HEILER purc

portedly is the representative in Cuba of the Seaboard Steel Company of

New York City. From the limited information available concerning him, it

would appear that he is an international floater out to make a fast dollar

whenever possible, He was reported to be residing at the Hotel Sevilla-

Biltmore in 1952.

He' definitely does not work for the American Embassy!
