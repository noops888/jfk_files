NOTE FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: JFK-Package from Ford Library

1.

on 9 June, at a meeting with NARA officials on the

JFK documents, I raised the subject of the package of

withdrawal sheets we had received from the President. Ford

Libraryâ€¢

Steve Tilley, NARA advised me that no action was

required by CIA with regard to the package. He said he had

spoken with Karen Holzhausen of the Library about the

package, and learned that the sheets were sent to

Steve Katz, a Senate staffer, in response to a specific

request from him.

Tilley agreed

that HRG would hold the

package temporarily.

2.

I told him that we had identified classified

information in the package of withdrawal sheets e g, name

or a station, although the sheets carried no classification.

He took note of this problem.

Subject & Rockefeller Commission files information

To

3, Steve Katz, Senate Committee on Government Affairs

Enclosed are the finding aid to the Rockefeller Comission files

we have processed, copies of all the withdrawal sheets, and some

explanatory information.

About the withdrawal sheets:

When we remove a classified

document from a folder we record more information for

administrative purposes than you find on these withdrawal sheets.

The data put into such fields as creator's agency, classifying

agency, Classification level, coments, and special markings are

not printed on this short form that researchers see.

Our

computer program was designed to produce these abbreviated public

descriptions because some agencies,

chiefly the CIA, do not want

to be public identified as the originator of specific documents.

We have made the withdrawal sheets for the Rockefeller Commission

Items we have processed more explicit than normal practice

because the Church Committee published the gist of most of these

documents in 1975, identifying the CIA connection.

But, because

of the software limitations, the computer cannot print the

I think there is enough information for you to deduce the

originating.agency for most of these documents. Most of them

were supplied to the Rockefeller Commission by the cla, although

many of them are of interagency origin.

If you have questions

about particular sheets, please don't hesitate to call me.

We may find that some, perhaps many, of these documents have

already been declassified, but rather than take the time to

research all of them and delay "opening" the collection, we

simply "pink sheeted" everything and will wait to see what

happens with the proposed review commission. If they are not

systematically declassified, we will research them individually

as they are requested under mandatory review.
