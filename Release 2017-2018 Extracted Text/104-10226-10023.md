HORVAT, Pavle

Pavle Horvat is of Slovenian oririn, about 50 years old and was

born in the Alekija district near the Hungarian border (formerly a

part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy)

Horvat became known durin: the thirties through his numerous

manifestos and rosters by which he attempted to organize his own

political morement.

He never had, however, any following and never set up his

an electoral lists. On the other hand, it is true, that the Croat

Peasant Farty of Dr.

sacek considered him as one of its trustees ir

Slovenia for a short period.

He earned his living as a farmer.

He also had a small village

that 1s, performing all types of secretarial services for the feasants

of the area.

Anong other things, he undertook to organize the

transportation of the seasonal workers who went to France and

Germary during the harvesting months. He had difficulties with the

home authorities and police in this respect and had to apear before

the courts on a number of occasions.

At the beginning of the war he fled to cagreb, Croatia, at that

sime the Independent Croat State (Nazi purpet regime) of Dr. Pavelic.

There he set ub a small office for the relief of Slovenian refugees

but it never reached any large proportions. He was not connected

with the Refugee Connittee which handled the main relief work (Cne

an office and function 1: Zagreb during the period meant that he tas

In July 1949, Horvat wrote the Honorable Joserh C. Grew in care

of the National Committee for a Free Europe introducing himself ag

the Representative of the Democratic Slovenes and Fresident of the

Interrational leasant Union for burore, and sur esting that he foir

• 'In return for a trip to the united States he offered to bring a

large confidential report on his activities to date and present a

scheme for successfully surpressing corrunism and delivering the

subjugated nations in the shortest bossible time.

He was informed

that the Fund was confining its activities to refugee leaders already

residing in the United States and that the proposed visit was

1m ossible at that time.

Horvat has recently announced his forthcoming arrival in the

United States.

Several Sloventan and Croatian neispapers in thi

country have received articles (which he wrote himself) glorifying

his past and present activities. None of them, so far, have taken any

notice of these articles with the excertion of the Croat separatiat

(pro-ustachi) paper, "DAlICh," published in Chicase

Supposedly

Dro sacek was highly amused on reading the article describing the

great Slovene peasant leader."

CESCET

7 March 1958

ANMORANDUM FORI ASSISTANY DIRECTCR FOR POLICY DOORTINATION

- -SUBJECT:

NCE

For quito some time the stall ofiscere of thie diriedon concerned

with utilining the racilitios of the NC'i and with or 1014ing the

Albandan, Bulgarian, and Rumanian engrations hare been evare of a laol

of adoquate coordination batween our omn activities and tose of the

NCFE ataif.

In conjunction with those Ml Division officers responsible

for handling our relations with that organination, we have attempted

to explore the problem in order to find a solution unich could be

conaidered realistie and practieal.

The difficulty. lles not only in the communication systen between

ope and NCrE, which does not alwaye tranait, it exactly the right ane,

the right ideas from one organisation to the proper individuals at the

right lovel n the other.

Although to hars maintained very. close contact

both informally and through formal channels, only too often we have not

been in a poaltion to leary why NCIE staff officers have made a givon decis

lon in ragard to sono eniere organisation in which we had an interest, and

on the other hand, our desired and neede have not always been fully under

stood or accented

in New lork Again, it has happened that we were

Ignorant of dovelopments that clopoly affectod our operations until 1t

was too late for us to naie or Influence felt, and, correspondingly,

It must be admitted that we have oursoive? pushed arand with courses of

action without adequately brieling the NCt.

The most extreme case in

point known to us concerna the furanian enigration, shere we and NCFE

are now pursuing contlietin policies.

The upshot al this has been the

kradual develoment of a situation wheroin OrC is supporting an organise

thon, the NChi, which is' not tully responsive to 1t.

3.

This situation le not rogarded by us as reflecting any fundamental

Inadequacy in NCFi, or as jrasentin any insoluable difficulty.

There

exiats a problem in staff interrelationship which ean and should be

resolved by a reform in our organisational ap-roach.

The coal toward which

we believe we should work is one where OrC communication with NCIE would

be channolled directly alone a single high-level line which wold f1raly

tie in AirC's office with thit of the head of the other organisation.

Idens, suggestions, infomation, alc.

sould flou, in the regular channelo,

up fron the OPC working level to lard's offico for review ans translasion

to the top office of Ncis,

and flow down fron there through N'S'g usual

channela to the proper Individuals in 14s operational machinery.

Personal

contacte botween individuals at a lover level in the tro organisations

mould fremantly occur to supplement this usual crannal, when security

peraitted, but should be in the hands of responsible personal sho

understand the OPC policies involved.

I consider it in»dvisable for mito address your Paycholoiçal Stratern

THE "VOICE" AND RADIO FREE EUROPE

COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER

Buth Are Indispensable

"'What's the difference berween the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe?" "Why

is it necessary to liave bush the Voice and Radio Free Europe?" These are frequent questions

asked of General Clay and the other leaders of she Crusade fur Freedom.

The Voice and Radio Free Europe are both vitally needed if we are to win the

Cold War.

They are completely separare organizations. Each performs a distiner function in the fight

against the gigantic Soviet propaganda machine.

The Voice speaks with the authority of the U. S. Government. It is financed by Govern-

ment funds.

Radio Free Europe was ser up by private cirizens. It is financed by millions of individual

contributions to the Crusade for Frecdom.

Voice is World Wide

l he Voice is a worldwide nerwork, broadcasting in 46 languages over 75 transmitters.

s the only American voice heard in the Sovier Union. Is 120 individual daily programs o

news, music, roundtables, corimentaries, documentaries, service programs, erc., have a porential

audience of 300,000,000 listeners. -

Radio Free Europe is much smaller. It concentrates on the captive cuuntries behind the

Iron Curtain: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania. Its transmis-

ters are in Western Europe.

poine of view.

Bur Voice is nor limited to Government pronouncements; is regularly refleces American

opinion as expressed in our press and radio. In a friendly way with programs of informa-

sion and service i promores a berter understanding of she United Stares in Europe, in Latin

America, the Far East and the Near Ease.

1951 Year of Progress for "Voice"

During the past year the Voice of America:

1. Sepped up daily programming from 30 to 50 hours daily.

2. Made progress in overcoming Soviet jamming.

3. Increased its broadcasts no behind the Iron Curtain, adding the "splinter" languages of

Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Tatar, Turkestani, Larvian, Lithuanian and Estonian,

4. Inaugurared programs so Altania, Finland, Israel and Portugal in their respective languages;

to China in two additional dialers, Swarow and Amoy; 80 Japan and South and Southease

Asia in Hindi, Urdu, Thai, Burmese and Malayan.

5. Became more outspoken and hard-hirting. One of the principal themes was the support of

the UN effort to repel the Chinese and North Korean Communist aggression in Korea.

Major attention was given to exposing the fraudulens Soviet "peare" drive.

6. Began work on the "TRing Plan" approved by Congress, which calls for a network nf power-

ful relay bases girdling the globe.

7. Creased "Vagabond"-a ship equipped with a transmitter, so that radio broadcasts may

be relayed from shipboard.

8. Received 318,000 lerrers from overseas listeners-an increase of 38% Over 1950.

9. Need'ed the Communists so successfully shas Radio Moscow and Sovier regional stations

THE NATIONAL. COMMITTEE FOR A FREF EUROPE, INC., is a

group of private citizens who have drawn together to carry out concrete

and direct action to restore and strengthen man's most valued possession-

frecdom.

The Committee has as its active allies numerous exiled democratic

leaders who hase found haven in the United States from the Communist

tyranny of tastern Europe. Radio Free Europe, of the National Committee

for a Frey Europe, is setting up facilities that will enable these trusted

patriots to be heard again by their own people. Noe only does Fastern

Furope hear the exiles' impressions of the United States, but American

messages of hope and encouragement are transmitter, and, above all, the

truth shich totalitarian governments forbid their enslaveel peoples to hear.

Freelom or the enslavement of men's minds and souls, is the vital issue.

What shall we pass on to our children-their righiful heritage of freedom,

or the spiritual desastation of Communism? At this very moment the kind

of world they will inherie hangs in the balance. The issue is for you to

decide. In the vital confliet for the preservation of freedom, the National

Committee for a Free Europe ollers every single citizen the opportunisy so

throw in his weight.

Hashington, D. Co

Deer Allen:

At a meting so tho Executive Conmittce of the Board of N.C.F.r.

held on Joury 350 art, the senbors fult that tro of the subjects

diecussed at that bus should be called to your ettention so that you

micht know the viris o? the Counttee In the event those muttora were

brought before you at e later date.

The firat ceresen a sugrection which armrintly cine informelly

fron McCluny und oare in Incomfree,

thut 11 serris could be fourd to

do so, they be allored to use some of the R.".E. Iscilities in Germany

for cortein

of their uroudcasts. Since this batter was not brought up

as a formal request, so action was token by the comittee, but the in

dividual members untuouely expreced the opinion that this would be

most inadvisable and that they would be opposed to the use of R.f.F.

fucilitles for this spots oven 18 tine and Ircuencies were avail-

eble, which 1o not si ell certrin.

Since Ancourse 18 an orginization

1t seems advieable to acgunint you

our muin concern 1s tirt Anconfree's targets ore encirely different

from those in which ie are intsrented, and fren the standpoint of

operation from Gert Boll they urr far lesa 11k-ly to be agreeable to

BONN. We are fecrial of putting in Jeopurdy & presently successful

operation and four i five million dollars of equipmunt by the intro-

duction of a project rich un fuel should be kept separate and apart.

The other artier which come up for formal action involved the

adrienhility of uniertiring Pollah progreming In Germny, and the

Executive Committee Et rmously ogreed that R.F... should proceed

11tr the plans preacetes.

In brief, such plena call for the origina-

tion of from three to your tours delly of Polith progriming from Munich

beginning on or aboüt. Yay 1, 1992, and the introsuction of some 50 te

60 Poles into the ciry of Hunch for work with P.f.E. to carry out

this schedule.

Since this 16 & safor step in the development of R.F.F. program-

you should be formally advised of

However, Its commentaries on foreign politics

are severely criticised and allegedly the general opinion in

Hungary 18 that whoever writes this program has not the

slightest idea either of the conditions in Hungary or of the

general needs of the people.

"D. Tuere are ilso objections to the program of News

Briefs (ROVAT ADhSOK).

This propram is considered a nuisance

and isn't even listened to by those for whom it i3 intended.

By scheduling 15 and 30 minuto prorrans specifically beamed

to different serments of the population, such as: the women's

progran, the church prortam, the farnerg program, book and

movie reviews, etco, Radio Pree burope reduces its listening

audience to those uno might be interested in tre specifio

program, while the majority of the liateners are forced either

to cease listenire, to their radios or change to another broad

castini station.

As a result, Radio free Durope has beon losing

Its audienco and the declino is especially noticeale during

the prorran of Nors Briefs whon the majority of the listonors

allegedly change over to the BAC prograle

A. Porative Stare

At 1ts 1-ces-1on, the Natlonal Contree for a Pree Europe

belleved that its Iron Cartain broadcasting operation, Hadio Pree

Europe, could and anoila te cavaloped and pursiad througis the nodium

0f "National Councila® os "Concittees of Liberation" composed of

prominent exile leaders and personalitles of each natlonallty proup

could exprese to their captive esuntrymen, entirely without inerican

advice and guidance, tie sessage of hore unieh !'CP" proposad to send.

This concope was not taililled, Expertence in atrenpelng to weld a.

talented, dedicatod grasp oi exiles into a non-partisan broadcasting

operation early deconstrates that vithout Averican control the rission

of ArE would bo lost 1a tie jungle of exilo-world polities. It soon

becare evident that the leadership among the exiles was neither auffl-

elently strong nor perso ally villine to rise abore tie politioul cross

Since the advent of Rit was the most important development

affecting the extles wiich ind occurred since their flinht fro: home,

they quickly understood and applauded its implications and potential

etect on their futures. Inrouch tile instrument they could once

again becone prominent and powerful in the affairs of the horeland;

once sore they could contend for place and power.

S:lection of personnel for the purpose at hand quickly became

a political football of rival leaders, personalities, and groups.

Elsttists, Loftists, Centrists, Labor Elements, and Splinter-groupa

argied with us for advancenent of their particular personal or political

viows. Sponsorship of their own adherents as RFi exployees through who

such views would be broadcast to their captive countrymen becare the

pattern of their pseudo cooperation. This pattern was followed to such

an extent that ordinary progress and sensible development of our basio

pappose of truly free broadcasts under exile control soon appeared to

be sot only impractleable, but dangerous. For example, the National

Couse!lo Diviaion atleapted to Inaugurate broadcaste to Crochoslovakla

under the auspices of a Czechoslovak National Council. The Council was

and is sade up of exile personalitios of difieriny political views and

partios. Its factions proceeded to enfago in endless disputes aid 1r

obvious that uncontrolled exile-world Councila and professional poll-

In spite of every effort to induce harony in and obtain proper

cooperation fros the "Councils", "Comalttees", and indlviduals, ipt was

staiting has boon accomplished by examining the quallf'uations of duly

recurmendod individuals, whethor the reconmendations come fron polisical

personlities

or othorwise. Solection 1s basud on the ability of the

individual to fill a need efficlontly in turning out or partloipating

in planned programs. Rocrultment ls dotornined only by Idoological

secrity, indopondance of oxile politios, and porsonal ability, This

is not to say that many individual exiles having doolded personal con

victions and well-kuom political records are not employad, but a

positivo stutement is made that thoso axile employees who now produce

REE prograns raflect the policlos and guldando of RPE rather than prom

motion of partisan objectives and personalities.

B. Rocruitment = Detailed Procouuros

The personnel complement of each RFE nationality dask is

founded on a hard core of dependable individuals, usually two or three

people, including the chief of the desk. "Dependability" is established

by arcaustive inguiry at all available sources to establish the destro

ability, rollability, tochnical proficiancy and security of the working

cora o° the desk. Sources usad are:

1o On at lenot four ocoaslons Mr. Willian Scrippa, Detrolt Newa,

diroctly or indirectly has approached the Govarment vith proposala for

utilization of balloone for psychological varfaro. Followiug is a liat

of tho daton and method of these approachess

do 12 October 1950 - Lotter from General We Je Donovan to DCI

enclosins "Operation Ballast."

On 1 November 1950 WIlian H. Jackson

responded to this memorandum to the effect that this suggostod opera

tion was bolog referred to the appropriate parsons and suggesting a

subsequent nooting with Donovan to discuss this and other matters.

De

In November 1950 an ve vere undertaking planning for develop.

mont of bulloons with Goneral Milla, ve vero informed that Mr. Scrippa

planned a goneral meeting to be hold in Washington to discuss balloona.

Through the Genoral Mills Washington Representative Mr. Soripps was

persuaded to keep his meeting general and was lafoned that the various

agencies of the Govornment had the matter under consideration and

considered that 1t would not be in the public interest at this time

to disclone tho nature of their findings, Coasequantly, Mr. Scrippa

forwarded us on 1 December 1950 a proposal "The Use of Froe Balloons

for Load Carrying Purposes" which we acknowlodged on Il December 1950.

co On December 26, 1950 General Smith roveived a letter from

Blair Hoody summarising & suggestion from Mr. Willian scrippa for

encouraging defection of Chinese Communist troops, A routine response

to his letter was aent 6 January 1951 from Mr. Jackso:, I belleve

also Mi. Moody called upon the Directo: In early Fabriary of 1951 to

discuss use of balloons for psychological varfare. ADFC addressed &

briefing memorandum to DCI on 12 February 1951, Subja Balloona for

Carrying PW Material to Sovlet Areas.

2. In Septembor 1950 the NPSB requested that Old should represent all

Interested ageneles of this Goverument and should accorilagly take steps

to develop, procure and atockpile nn appropriate number or scientifically

designed balloons for future propaganda use la contitloss of international

emergency, At metings of the IPSB on 13 February 1951 and 1l June 1951

1t was agreed that OPt vould procure and stockpile 1,000 largo learlot

balloons for use by the appropriate agency uben and 1f such use vas

authorised, The Board also agreed that Inguirion unied the varlous govern

A poraral of tho NPSB aínutes sinse June 1751 did not insicato

Fron this
