Henry Petersen, Deputy Assistant Chief of the Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section of the Department, telephoned Section Chief 1.

J. McAndrews

this morning. He advised the Department had sent two attorneys to New Orleans

over the week end in order that they might begin this morning presenting evidence

to a Federal Grand Jury looking towards the return of indictments against

Carlos Marcello, notorious New Orleans racketeer and gambler and one of the

prime targets for prosecution included on the original list of 40 such persons.

His brother, Joseph, is also to be indicted. These indictments relate to Fraud

Against the Government and perjury in a civil suit against the Attorney General

and Immigration and Naturalization Service as an outgrowth of the deportation

proceedings against Carlos Marcello.

As a matter of background, we have at the request of the Department,

conducted investigation relating to an affidavit filed by Carlos Marcello in support

of his civill suit. In this affidavit, Marcello denied that he had ever utilized his

Guatemalan birth certificate. As a matter of fact, information concerning this

Guatemalan birth certificate was initially developed by the FBI. The information

was turned over to Immigration and Naturalization Service who thereafter deported

Marcello, He surreptitiously re-entered the United States following this deportation

and civil litigation in this regard is pending.

SAC Maynor telephoned from New Orleans at 10:45 a.m., today.

October 30, 1961, and advised that he had been contacted by the two departmental

attorneys, John Diuguid and Edward Molenof, who told Maynor they were in New

Orleans to present evidence to a grand jury and secure indictments against Carlos

and Joseph Marcello. Most of the evidence to be submitted to the grand jury is a

reading of a transcript of testimony before another grand jury in the District of

Columbia. It is necessary to do this in New Orleans, the departmental attorneys

say, since venue lies there. 'In addition, the departmental attorneys propose to

have SA Regis Kennedy of our New Orleans Division testify as to investigation

which he conducted in this matter. The Department attorneys feel certain indictments

will be returned this afternoon.

They asked that following the return of the

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

Re: CARLOS MARCELLO

indictments, the FBI arrest Carlos and Joseph Marcello. The New Orleans Division

is making an immediate check to determine if the Marcellos are in New Orleans.

at this time.

ACTION BEING TAKEN

1.- SAC Maynor is pointing out to the Department attorneys the

notorious character of the Marcellos and the fact that Carlos Marcello was able

to surreptitiously re-enter the United States following his deportation. Under

these circumstances, it is essential that the Department attorneys arrange to

have a secret indictment returned which is to be unsealed when the arrests are

made, if the FBI is to make the arrest. SAC Maynor will advise the Bureau

promptly when a determination is made if the Marcellos are in New Orleans today;

however, the Department attorneys are not to be informed in this regard.

Since the FBI has conducted the investigation relating to the

perjury and Fraud Against the Government charges, it would be proper for us to

make the arrest.. We should, however, control this situation and secret indictments

are essential.

3. Inasmuch as Carlos Marcello is one of the 40 prime targets for

prosecution under the Attorney General's drive against organized crime, it would

appear the press release once the arrests are made should emanate from

Washington. It is believed that DeLoach should get in touch with Ed Guthman of

this case.

sandled, with bution,

the Department to insure that we receive proper recognition for our assistance in

\ Developments in this matter will be immediately brought to your attention.
