FBI reports submitted in connection with case o1

United States

v.

Bonanno, Jogaph

WEF: PW: cb Holluman

Miss Gandy.

123-51-471

The Special Assistant to the Attorney General in

-charge of the prosecution of the subject case has called our

attention to the fact that many of the FBI reports received

since the return of the indictment in this case have reflected

interviews conducted by Agents a year or more before the date

of the typed reports. For example a report will be furnished

of an interview of witness Jones in March 1958, but the report

will be dated June 1959.

It is anticipated that when these witnesses testify

atithe Trial a demand will be made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3500

for the production of statements by the witness in the possession

of the Government. The reports of interviews are probably not

subject to production under the statute and production thereof

will be opposed by Government Counsel. The fact remains, however,.

that under the statute the reports can be, and in all probability

will be, examined by the trial judge in camera.

We must anticipate that in the event of such inspection

the Court will require some explanation for the interval between

the date of the interview and the

date of the report.

There are at least two possible explanations:

1. That the 1959 reports were made from notes not

previously transcribed.

2.

That the 1959 reports were taken from earlier

reports which covered more than the single

interview and that defendants are entitled only l

to the full text of interview of the witness

involved.

In view of this you are requested to advise us as

the explanation for the time lapse noted above in order

that Government Counsel can supply it to the Court if required
