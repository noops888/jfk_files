PCI

on December 16, 1962, advised

that it was believed that FRANK SINATRA would come to New

Orleans with DEAN MARTIN

early. In December, 1962, when MARTIN

was filming a portion of a motion picture;

and MARCELLO

wanted to contact FRANK SINATRA.

advised that

SINATRA did not come to New Orleans, and as far as he knew

there was no contact between MARCELLO and SINATRA.

The Los Angeles Office, by airtels dated November 20,

21, and 26, 1962, in the BILSOL, NBA investigation, reported

information involving HOMER and MAXINE SNOWDEN, 5206 Brookview

Drive, Dallas, Texas, who are possible connections with BILLIE

SOL ESTES.

Among SNOWDEN's activities was his association with

WILLIAM RUSSELL PRUNER, Apartment 103, 2509 Turtle Creeks

Dallas, Texas, President of Texas-Mustang Industries, Inc.,

2528 Farrington, Dallas, Texas.

An individual named EDWARD NICHOLAS BECKER, 8613

West Olympic, Los Angeles, a licensed private investigator

in the state

was introduced by SNOWDEN to

PRUNER on Seprember 20, 1962, AlsO present was CARLO ROPPOID,

age 27, a graduate

geologist

of Louisiana State University,

residence 515 Egan Street, Shreveport, Louisiana. The meeting

was to promote an oil additive known as Mustang, and ROPPOLO

expressed an interest in being the Louisiana distributor.

ROPPOLO claims he wanted to contact a wealthy and influential

uncle in New Orleans, and BECKER and ROPPOLO were supposed to

have gone to New Orleans to get this Individual, who was

subsequently identified as CARLOS MARCELLO. ROPPOLO alleged

several days later that his mother 1s. CARLOS MARCELLO's sister.

The significance of the activities of SNOWDEN, PRUNER, and

BECKER,

insofar as the relationship with MARCELLO, is

unknown

SNOWDEN is apparently an oil promoter who has numerous

promotional interests and has apparently served in both the

California State Penitentiary and the Federal Correctional

Institution at Terminal Island.

In view of the possibility

that this information

is part of the intrigue involving

private investigators connected with the BILSOL case, the

information is not being included in the body of the report;

however, efforts will be made to determine any possible

connections

between MARCELLO and CARLO ROPPOLO.
