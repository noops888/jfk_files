JONES stated that he had built a house on Blanch Circle which nome cost him $6, 500.

It is to be noted that this home was purchased from Foilara-simnons.

Record 2

Discussion of GUTHRit's German Shephera dog 22 months old.

Recora 3

JONES discussion of the pover of money relating that a few years ago $50 a week

was good money but now was nothing

Record 4

GUTHRiE stated that he had chance to buy a .357 Magnum revolver and he described

to JONES the penetrating power of the weapon stating it would shoot completely

through a Packard automobile. PAUL advised GutHRIE not to buy any kind of gun.

He stated friends will give him guns and guns he will confiscate at the Sheriff's

Office will more than satisfy his needs. JONES aiscusses the relative merits of

various firearms stating that in his estimation a 32.20 is a gun he believes best

suited for his purpose as it will penetrate a bullet-proof vest, hovever, JONES

stated this sun nad no snocking power, that it would go through a men aná

much damage. He advised GÜTHRIE to carry a firearm tith the most shocking force.

PAuL says his gun is a Colt 45 automatic with hammer and trigger guard sawed off.

Recora 5

He described this gun as being loaded with a clip containing three shells, which

clip nolds the ejected cartriäge case after the bullet has been firea. He re-

lates that this gun is extremely handy inasmuch as it is difficult on a rainy

night to crawl arouna on your hand and knees looking for ejected cartriage cases.

He states he knows a man who smuggled in 100 gunds from Germany and they are

perfect. JONES stated that he never hit a nan with a gun in his life and never

wants to be hit by one. The only time he had ever taken a gun irom his pocket,

or rould ever take it from si pocket would be for one purpose and that would

be to kill someone. A gun to him is a weapmonly to be used for mufäer. CRIME CCMIMSSION

spot in the Unitea States today, the hottest spot. Not only that,

but

JONES:

J.

Why is it hot?

Because they let this vice get out of control. I know there is

going to be dice ganes, bookie joints, and -

Why not control it?

That's what they should have done, but they let it get out and the

only way to control it is this way now,

J.

G.

It can be controlled.

all of them got scared when some of these people were identified

here in town, right after Miryard was bit ana they came to me and

offered me the thing for $5000 dollars a week. I told them if the

I'm fed up with that shooting. i don't care if a man is a gambler he

We don't shoot nobody. We don't shoot nobody. There won't be no

You know how we get mixed up with Lipski. He was a dairyman in

Chicago. Lipski startea the Farmers Co-operative Association and

he wanted the Jairyman Union, of which we are interested in; and he

manted us to Of him and his Cooperative Union.

After while Lipski

He went into the black market

whiskey business with a fellor named louis Isharo (phonetic) and they

made about one million dollars quick. Lipski and Isharo bought the

Lockheed factory in Los Angeles. The Internal Revenue moves in on

him and he loses everything. Lipski goes to Mick DeJohns and said I

am broke.

I want to leave Chicago and would like a little help. He

had never been to ballas, Texas in his life.

I got him a room and he

came to Dallas and just drove around and told me he would like the li-

quor.

"anted to know the law on beer here. He said he haâ an opening

for 5,000 gallons of bondea whiskey in kegs.

5,000.

Yes, he said t would like to have a store to put it through. I said

vinat's the deal. He told me. He said i have already talked to Nick.

I said why don't you go back to Chicago anà talk to Nick and I'll

call Nick and tel him you'll be down.. We opened a store, then a

bigger store as the first one wasn't big enough.

He said send me

two

clerks from Chicago. I ask why he didn't hire local clerks and

he said he had rather have somebody he knew and could trust. I said

OK. He sent 2 fellows whom 1 aid not know. da told them to come to

me.

Iney called me and told me they vere in room so and so at the

Aaolphus, so i went down to see them. I look at them and they tell me

that lipski sent them cown.

They continued living at the golphus.

Next time I talk to Nick i told him these 2 licuor clerks sent from

Chicago were still living at the Adolphus, eating at big places, and

opened charge account at weinans. I said how about it, a little nigh

I want to explain how that happened, because that stinks to high heaven.

Lipski said he was going to lose lots of money liquidating the store. He

said he would stay here if Nick would let him.

Nick said Faul is there

oe bought. Lipski said t'11 buy it. 1 sald where are you going to get

your $70,000. He said I'll get it from Paul. raul's night club, Chicago.

Sgt. Akard from the Chicago Folice brought $60, 000 and he bought one balf

interest in Southwestern Amusement Co.

G.

Is Lou Schneider one of nis men.

J.

Yes, you was one of his men but lou came later, he was in the irmy at this

I say, now marcus if you want to get in

Dallas I'll go to Chicago with you and we'll sit down with the man in

I put a stop to that. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in the "stir".

I told him that I have livea with these people, I have worked with them ano

olayed with them and I think I knor their reaction. That would be the

wrong thing to do.. In the first place you're not going to take them over.

If the opportunity ever presents itself I'll take them over, not you.

We argued for several days.

He said well' Paul what about the slot machines,

hor about me taking over all them.

I said all right I'll give you the

slot machines but you are going to have to buy them and at their terms.

I'll get them all together and find out how much money it will take if

they want to sell. So i bought out the slot machines and juke boxes in

Shreveport, Monroe, duston, Louisiana, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Mineral Wells

While we are on this subject I want to get a few things straight. I

an a young man at this thing... You know the church people put me on.

You know yourself that nobody was behind me. What would they say if

I opened up a joint out in the county.

You're not going to open the joint.

Well I mean if a joint is openea. linat about tonzaullas, he'll can

my ass off.

You have nothing to do with this joint.

money.

All I am going to have out there is a man to protect the geme

to see that the "deals" don't throw the money away.

Your man is there

to handle the money, and I am going to have a man there to protect

him because he is not going to be smart enough, because all he can do

is to keep sonebody from taking it out of his pocket.

And if ferra

New Yorker, Clint Matheson or some of those boys come in, and they will

be in with a couple hundred thousand in their pocket to shoot at.

you, you want to be able to protect yourself.

G:. I think that is out of the question as to the county.

J/ Why?

G: Well you know way, they haven't had it so far.

J: Why?

G: The damn state would get on their ass,

man/

J: Why doesn't the state get on "Jöp of the üill".

G:

Because Amel Carter, takes care of that I imagine. You take Gonzawles.

I don't now whether he has anythine to do with this or not but he is

rough.

J:

They take care of Gonzaulles in the City why not in the county.

Here is what I am trying to get straight. you know you are my

friend.

I can trust you. how in the hell are we going to open a

place when there hasn't been a place in the county.

That is one reason why the syndicate has no complaint to make,: that 15

why I want to open in the county.

B¢ The County, virgin territory.

Go I know it is virgin territory.

Jo I an not stepping on no bodys toes if we open in the county.

Ob, shit man, you don't know. I am telling you boy, I am scared of

thos Rangers. They can get me.

J.

How?

They say, Guthrie, come here we are going out here and put a pad-lock

on this joint.. Then there goes all the money..

All right, suppose they come out and are caused to close the place.

Before they do that, before they come in don't you think it would be

smart for you to raid the place once in a while.

Jo.

But Paul you can

t get by those boys.. They slip in here without anybody

knowing 1t.

Well maybe lf the Rangers get too active, maybe they might be transferred

to El Paso or some place like that for their bealth.

G. How about Gonzales?

J. Gonzaulles gets along here allright. He has not bothered anybody.. Has

he bothered anybody?

Go

Well I don't know that he has bothered anybody but I know he is here

24 hours a day, six days a week.

J.. There is only one man I am not sure of and that is Will Wilson.

G. Well, I tell you one thing, Will is rough.

J.. I would like to know how we can handle Will Wilson.

All right you say you are going to finance everything 100%, how much

are you going to put out for will Wilson?

J. 1 would offer Will Wilson -

Jo

Do, 1'11 tell you why. I want you people to see how it is.

You have

You have your

have got to take care of Gonzaulles, you have got to take care of this

Vice Squad, that all comes off the top. Then you arrive at the profit.

He will divide the profits 50-50. All profits fron the gambling, marble

tables, slot machines, punch boards, go into the company. When we

later take over the city of Dallas it will al go into this company.

I will guarantee you that you will have noopposition for re-election.

Just let me tell you thatthen time comes for you to make. your income

settlement. See what I mean. It is like this, you walk in and say,

Ilsten, I made a lot of money, didn't keep no records and don't know

where lots of it came from, but my man does the talking.. He takes

you to the man who knows what it is all about.

G.

You know Paul yourself that you can't spend a pocket full of money.

J.

He are going to worry about you more than you are going to worry about

yourself.

G. I don't know about that.

J.

They are not going to let you do anything that will embarrass you because

it is our interest to protect you, we have got to. He do everything

possible to keep crime down in the county.

You know that when crime

is committed the heat is put on you. he can't keep kids from stealing

autonobiles, but we can keep any known criminal from operating in the

county.

G. I don't think you can get to Will Wilson without an initial offering.

Jo

that do you mean an initial offering.

G. I mean he will have to have some money in advance..

Jo

Let me tell you something.: From Wilson's stanapoint, It would be a

mistake for him to do that. Because Wilson is not sure what he can

do for us.

You know what he can do for me.

Jo He tried to keep him from running and he wanted to run.

Go You all didn't have anybody in the DA race?

J. Not no body. Priest offered me for $10,000 campaign expenses that, that

was all I would have to give him for two years.

Go Now

tell me, no you don't have to tell me unless you want to. Did you

get tied up in the Sheriff's race?

J. No, not at all.

S.

I don't think Snoot Schmid is getting anything out of the city of.

sowd tell you where he is getting all. that money. : His two

Deputies who are uniform cruisers in the Sheriff's office, that operate

on the Northwest dighray. I know the fellows with slot machines around

White Rock Lake, and Roff's hicken Shack. They pay these men $25 a week

a piece.

Now they are cheating on Smoot.

You mean these uniforn men take the money.

J. Yes, $25 a week each for leaving those machines alone.

B. How many machines would you say he had 'in all.

Go

He must have about 30 in all going.: Don't you know somebody in the

Sheriff's office is operating machines. "You know who is operating

them too, Al Meadows.

J.

But all this can't be done in a day. or a week, it has to be done

gradually, Here is what I want to do. I could have come to you and

offered you so much a week or month and get a protecting account.

You want to be Sheriff.

B.

Didn't you mention being in Charleston and operating there. Is that

a new Sheriff?

I believe they run their city and county together.

J.

Yes, everybody works together.

Now that 1s what I want, definitely

we want to cooperate. "e want to be interested in this new city.

we'll have a favorable ministration in the city, one that will

line with them.

Go

You know you are awful big, but I still wonder If It would be worth

the $40,000 a month, about one half million a year.

J.

You are very conservative.

G. Do you think I could make the one half million a year for six or 8 years?

J. . As long as you want to be Sheriff.

Go

I know big money is being paid in Dallas but still - d know

they could cover the money up but hell what good is going to do me,

don't make but $7700 a year, you can't hide lt under your house.

J.

Ion are not going to have to hide it. You are going to pay incone tax

on it.

Go

But suppose somebody went down to the Income Tex Bureau and say we want

to check on

Guthrie's Income, some of my opponents, and they see where

I cleared nearly one half million dollars. Suppose some of my opponents

He have never beat a man who where. No where. I don't know of an

Incident where we were responsible for a man being beat. Take

Tucson, Arizona, during election this year. There was 16 people

running for Sheriff; but when all was over the man was elected without

opposition.. You mention the churches.

We contribute to them: too.

He don't forget them. You can be Sheriff of this County as long as

you want to Steve.

Go' Is that why Smoot has been Sheriff so long?

Un, " don't know, of course they took pretty good care of me. I got

everything out of the Sheriff's Office I ever ask for.

B. Yes.

J. Look, I have got to make a call or the lawyer will be calling.. I'n

going to call Chicago collect. (Jones calls Haymarket 1427)

Fest Virginia is a monopoly state. No whiskey during 0.P.A. Governor

of West Virginia said my people want whiskey. He said. I want to make a

deal with you. You furnish us enough whiskey for West Virginta, d'll

give you exclusive gambling privileges in the entire state. I said, it's

a deal. He started shipping whiskey in the State.

In next record Jones relates about Bob Minyard getting killed. States

It was done by sonebody who was mad at Bob for some personal reason such

as jealousy, rather than being gangland killing, the only justification

WaS

that Minyard was shot with a shot gun.

Next record Paul Jones relates conversation in which resulted in his

contacting Bob Minyard, local deceased gambler, on occasion in which Paul

had requested his wife to contact Mingard to obtain $1000 to send to him

in Kest Virginia.. Minyard allegedly becane fresh with his wife and

apologized to Jones when Jones contacted him.

On this record Jones relates his association mith a negro Doctor in

Dallas whom he names as Dr. Keys, a negro Dentist which Dentist recognized

him on the streets in Dallas and told Paul that he would give him anything

he wanted in negro town if he would get negro Policemen on the Dallas

Police force.

de relates that Dr. Keys took him to negro. Chamber of

Commerce meetingi and introduced him to many influential negroes throughout

Dallas.

Jones relates that through this association his organization will have

no trouble in taking over policy ganes among negroes in lllas.

In the next record Jones relates an amusing incident regarding his meeting

a former negro maid. of theirs on streets of Dallas while he was accompanied

by his wife.

Jones says this business I am in is organized business. We fight a lot

of those.

Dope; we are not interested. We know who sells dope in a town

and we have nothing to do with 1t.. He don't handle it; we don't touch it.

Only horse bookles, dice, slots, etc.

G. Isn't slots the main idea.

Jo.

I'Il tell you, "ere is why we like slots... Slots sit there and grind all

day and all night. They make a lot of money. A slot will last 25 years.

It is not cheating, you know what It will pay off.

This thing is such a big organization Paul is there any chance: for anyone

else to come in?

Jo No chance.

Is "apone boys still living?

J. Yes.

G. Ralph?

J. Yes.

Go Is he operating the main thing?

J.

1o. He is not the main man but he has done an awful lot of good work.

Ralph was never a big man. Guzik. Jack Guzik is the main man.

G.

J.

He is head of the whole thing.

They call him Greasy Thumb. I'il tell you one thing we are trying to

do. He would like. to. do it down here through the next legislature, that

is to operate a currency exchange.. Jones relates how currency exchange

operates.: States they control all exchanges in Chicago and that for small

service charge they will pay all the persons bills or cash their checks.

He points out that this is an aid to gambling inasmuch as an influential

person who drops a lot of money at a crap game may need to cash a check

to pay off his debt although he would not desire to have a check made

payable to a dice table or a known gambler. Therefore he. can passa

check through a money exchange which is a respectable organization.

In these

exchanges Jones relates that they are ideal for cashing black

market checks.

First part of record forty-one Jones continues to

describe. the working

of money exchanges and other casual conversation.

Go Paul what about the Internal Revenue Department on this deal?

J. They have never at any time prosecuted

anyone without first offering to

settle. They want your money, that is all they want.

Go

i.

How about Capone?. He got sent up on Tax evasion.

They tried to use him for an example and that was the only thing they

could ever convict Capone on. They knew he was guilty of lot of things

but that was all they could make a case on.

B. Where is Capone now?

J. Jones did not reply.

Jones states that an example of Internal Revenue's operation was

Steinberg case.

That Internal Revenue offered to make a settlement but

Steinberg refused.

Reason being if he made settlement with then he would

admit his black market activities and mas afraid of prosecution. Jones

said if he had been Steinberg he would have settled with Internal Revenue

and taken his chance with O.P.A.

G. Paul did you ever pull any time.

J. Yes.

G. How many?

J. 9 years 7 months 5 days altogether.

G. Federal case.

J. No, State, for killing a State witnesss.

G. For killing a state witness....

Go Paul you know how storles go around but I heard that while you were in prison

you entertained and traveled around with. the Governor and other people a

lot of time.

J.. Yes, I spent lot of time in Indiana, New Orleans,

Minneapolis and St. Paul.

The Governor should have taken me hunting with him we elected: him. Nobody

ever heard of the man till we elected him and later made him Secretary of

War.

Wino was the Democratic Secretary of War?

J. Did you ever hear of a fellow by name of Harry Woodrun?

Go Sure, I'll be darn.

Jo

I'll show you what we did, and they left that up to me. I was out on appeal

bond at time I figured out höw I could get out.

They put me in a coal mine

digging coal, and I got to figuring that they had only had 3 Democrat

history of the G-D state and that it was always Republi-

* got to thinking bow we could elect a Democrat Governor.. If I could

get one elected he would be so obligated to me that he would have to pardon

me the first thing he did, his first Official act. Not even my people

thought of this, nobody but me. I was the only one that thought. I had a

chance to get out, because there was a State Senator involved in it.

He

was the Speaker of the State Senate who was afraid if I ever got out I

mould either Involve him or kill him one or the other and I used to read

his letters of protest in which he would beg and plead that the prison

authorities place me in solitary confinement.: I contected my people and got

them to get the mall service to send out material to all precincts and con-

mitteemen.

Á11 the Committeemen in State of Kansas would get letters each

week from different people mailed fron this post office.

We contributed :

large amount of money for Democratic campaign to further the cause of the

Democratic candidacy in State elections..

He contributed to this year after

year and there was no known connection between me and this movement. Fin-

ally after building up this organization elected Moodring as Governor of

the State. We later elected Euxnuth. I was handling this while in the

prison office. I aid the buying for the prison. I opened a business in

the prison of loaning money to prisoners. hould loan $10 taking off inter-

est given them $9.

Tie can even elect. Smoot Schmid but two Centenniels, one State Fair and a

J. Did you ever see Bailey?

G. Never did.

J. He was a nice fellow.. Looks like a businessman. Mice, quiet, gentleman

acting fellow, nice and quiet, scholarly gentleman appearance. After

they took the

warden they opened the gates and invited everybody to get

out. it must have been a half hour after they got the warden that they got

out. Bailey was the one they brought the guns to.

Go

Paul do you remember the Urschel kidnapping case?

J. Oh, yes, well. We engineered it all.

G. Where did he go on that case?

J.

First to Leavenworth then on the Rock. Here is what I couldn't under-

rent the building in his name, nothing will be in my name, will be 1o-

PAT WANNING, SHERIFF-ELECT SIEVE GUTHRIE,

COONIT, AND DETECTIVE GEORGE BUTLER, DALLAS PO-

LICE DEPARTMENT, HELD AT HOME OF STEVE GUTHRIE,

DALLAS, TEXAS, NOVEMBER 7, 1946.

P:

We have told STEVE that he's going to have a clean administration and that we're

going to guide him and not embarrass him in any way, shape, or form.

The pro-

gram is just this, norse booking, slot machines, dice, numbers, everything.

We're going to keeplit clean. Tie're going to take over quietly.

He're not

going to embarrass him.

We've got about a month and a half left before he

takes office, and it will take a month and a half to get things set up.

S:

Nov, on that starting immediately, I've got something to say about that.

start immediately you're gonna immediately have trouble with some of these

people.

P :

We've got a month and a nalf.

We've got to get a building to service and house

these machines, these slots and marble tables and all.

S:

P:

Prell, that may be true.

he'll pick a local man who will be the front man for that. So far as everybody

knows, he's the man who's putting these machines in, the local man.

We put the

money up and train him and advise him and shon him now to set up.

M:

Have you got that man?

KNAPP: Well, re've got a lot of prospects. We have got a half dozen.

M: You can't go out on the street.. Then it leaks out and he's preparing and ar-

ranging. You know what I mean?

K:

He got a half dozen.

M: I'de rather wait.

S: I'd rather wait too.

You can't be too hasty about these things.

I'd rather wait and sacrifice.

rather sacrifice

two or three months.

P:

fell, my idea in starting, and this is the only reason. When he goes in, he's

gonna close everything.

K:

He's got a pretty good point there.

I want him to close this men too.

See what I mean? Nov, this man's not gonna

get active.

Maybe he's oni going to have a haif dozen machines going by the

time this man takes office. When this man takes office, he closes

everything.

Everything goes down.

He closes all the operators.

This man

stop, too, which

he actually will be stopped.

Then he starts out again.

K: He's gonna start first.

P: He starts first.

See what I mean?

M: I don't think it exposes

you so if you throw a man in business who hasn't been

in business before as soon as he takes office.

But could you come out now with four or a half dozen machines under this pre-

sent system.

P:

Yes, under this present administration. I can come out with eight or ten mach-

ines.

I can get the county Judge to go to BILL DECKER and tell BILL DECKER.

"t go to BIlt DECKER myself and tell him I want to run a few machines.

BILI." You see, then theyr'e gonna be spotting for the machines,

M: I see

P: When I talk to the County Judge, I'm not promising for nothing. I talk to the

County Judge just like I do the Sheriff.

M:

These machines that

are approved by the county or State, now do they go about it?

How do they access?

Who do they see? Is there any kind of county charge or tex.

K: $100 tax on each one and the Council allows the machines.

P: Oh no, it's fixed with the Vice Squad.

M: For the machine, in other nords. It isn't a thing that's legitimately open or

anything?

P: It's open but -

GEORGE: It's over-looked.

P: It's protected.

M: Tnat's what I mean. It's over-looked.

G: I understand when they call in down there, they go out and pick up.

S: Pick up a fer..

N: When they've got a drive

M: I see.

G: One thing I'ä like to ask PAUl here. He's pretty much a planner from what I

hear him

say and pretty wise in the way of politicians, etc.

Horking for the

city like I do and knowing

how more or less vicious some of these boys are in

the local set-up, I just wonder how he would go about moving in. I know

almost in my mind thet he has plans already made within the organization

that they have. How are you going about moving in?

P: There'll be no gun-play because I

can take BURNS.

S: Hell, now,

there's

some rough boys.

P:

I know but BURNS will go with me.

All right, when BURNs goes with me, that

eliminates AL MEADOWS and those fellows.

Well, I know AL MEADOWS and all them. They're three times losers and all

They've got the wrong kind of people hooked up in some of their busi-

nesses, but -

P: MEADOWS is the head of the slot machines.

S:

Hell, there's been four killings here, and you know it yourself - Paul,

there's four boys here that'll kill anybody when they get ready, and all they

have to do is get $10,000, $20,000 or $30,000, and they'll do it. And that's

the boys that l'm worried about, those four.

I'm not worried. I mean I can

take care of myself. I can shoot 'em and they're paid for.

But they're going

to make it rough on me by shooting somebody else, I'm afraia.

G:

The thing we're getting into -

M: They've been here and have the thing?

P: No, they don't have it.

S: No, they don't have It. They're the trigger men.

P: The muscle man. They're thieves.

They even steal slot machines from the

Syndicate and sell 'em back to them.

M: That can be eliminated. That you'll find anywhere.

S: Oh, i don't care how re eliminate 'em.

M:

Regardless of where you go, you find that in small and big counties. A cer-

tain amount of petty thieves, you know that's all they are.

They should he run

out of town anyway.

S: I know and I intend to run them out.

K: That's where you come in.

S: I really want to run them out.

M: The Chiei of Police and everybody else, that's their business. If they are

undesirable characters, they have no business in the city.

s:. No, and I don't want them here.

M: So we see to it that they are run out of town ourselves.

S: MR. MANNING, bere's the deal.

M: Call me Pat.

S:. O.F. Pat, this set-uo here.

There's a boy named LOIS GREEN." There's a boy

named JOHNNE GRASSATTI, JUNIOR THOMAS, WAG BARNES, and who else?

G:

Monk wright.

S: MOnK WRIGHT. Now, those boys are all up in the money now.

M: They should be run out of town.

S:

I know they ought. Now, I feel like I can get rià of these boys.

I would like

to get rid of 'em for good. I would like to take them out here and get ria of

them, that's what I want to do, ana if I possibly can, I will.

But I just

have to run them out, they're gonna make it awful miserable for me. They

hit.

They go either to San Antonio or Houston.

They've got tie-ups all ov-

er Texas.

I'm just telling you this because it's a thought.

They go out

here and get these boys, and they'll meke them come in here

and hit me and then

run.

Hit and run. Blow a safe,

shoot somebody, take out. "ell, it's hard to

Keep those guys out when you don't know who they are.. In other words, they

to Houston, anà pick up a boy and say "Come on, we got a place cased. Go

and knock it off and run."

So what do you think of that deal?

M:

well, Sheriff, it's like I told you in the beginning on that. Nobody in their

right

mind is going to come in here:

S: I think you got something there, too.

P:

Because I know all these boys.

I've had AL MEADOWS and all of them come to me.

They come to me with all kinds of propositions, and I told them I don't want

no part of it.

"Some guy's selling slot machines, "they come tell me. "We'll

go get

all of his machines. How much will you give us for it?" I tell them

I don't want these machines.

M:

Where do they get these machines?

P:

Some other operator. They tell us, "We'll go -" In fact they did go out here

to old lady SNYDER'S place, you know.

Backed a truck up there and took all

of her equipment out. look it all.

An operator here in town backed a truck

up and took all of the equipment.

But AL MEADOWS and JOHNNIE and DELOIS GREEN

and those people are not going to bother you in no shape or form.

But here's what I really had on my mind, is the local gambling syndicate,

BINTON and MILLER and those fellows.

S: That's right. They tie up.

G: They make a big lot of cash, you see, and they might not want to take this

lying down. They might want to fight, you see?

S: The take right now - I know this, the take now - net

for one man out of the

policy game is one million a year net. That's his net.

M:

"ell, have you no such thing as a

mouthpiece for this syndicate:

S: Yes, but he's gone.

he don't stay here. There's about 25 or 30 people trying

to getrim, and he stays up in Montana.

P: He left here when the town kent down before, when they had

a little trouble

down here.

They all run out of town. They closed

everything dorn. He ain't

come back here end as long as I'm here, he won't come back.

S: but he's still running the town.

P: He's still running the town.

S: From Montana.

P: He won't come back because his number two man got killed here.

Ni:

What's his name,

BINYON?

P: BINYON.

S: BENNIE BINYON.

G: Have you ever heard about him up there?

ill: io, never have.

S: He's a pretty big man.

M: I'a like to make notes. Do you mind?

Go let's get him a plece of paper.

S& Here you are.

M: Jot these names down. I can write on this.

P: Bennie Binyon, B-I-N-I-O-N.

You mentioned one of the present fellows here.

What was his name, ANGELOTTI?

S: JOHNNIE GRASSAFFI.

I: Is he an Italian boy?

S: Yes, Boy, be's a killer.

M: What's his last name?

P: This JOHNNIE, tough, is just a locel boy.

S: Yes, but he's in he money.

": He's the one who does the killing for lem.

s: He's the trigger man.

P:

He handles dope.. Hels got three or four whores working for him.

He's

got three Cadillacs that cruise up and down

the

streets with gals in 'em.

M:

Where are the city police? Where do you come in?

is this is a different phase of the work tha n I'm in. I'm on vacation now.

5: I'm gonna have him transferred to the Vice Squad.

G: I don't know. They pick these girls up.. Theyive a policy here of picking. them

up regularly and letting them pay fines and suggesting to them to discontinue.

It's a regular set-up.

There's 1400 of them a month go through there.

M:

A situation like that a nonth certainly departs the law. I mean, that's the

time you should go right on through and prosecute, because they are a menace

to society. When you get in office, you should go out and bring them in.

After all, you got. a law here. Iou don't have to take things like that fron

those petty hoodluns.

For that? They only embarrass you again while you're

in office. Maybe the sheriff, ridicules him going out in the street and shoot

ing up ilain Street, whatever your main street is here.

This LOIS GREEN, he's power crazy.

P. That's the one I ras telling you about. Let me tell it; it's a funny story.

S:: About the street car deal? Is that what you mean?

P: No, I'm

gonne tell about shooting this guy through the house.

S: Let me tell him about this street car deal.

M: it home they get caught every time they walk the street. We have certain squad.

over there, you know. They come out and get some of these certain fellows

Every time they walk, they won't let them walk the street.

Put 'en right

in their car, right to the bureau. Keep 'em there for two or three nights,

unless they get sprung before. Every time they walk the street.

S:

I'll show you how tough this GREEN thinks he is, and he is tough. He gets on

the front on the car track, street car track, and the street car man rings his

bell for him to get off, and he just sits right on it.

So the street car man

just keeps ringing his bell for him to get off, and he wouldn't get off.

So finally LOIS stopped his car right on

the track, got out, pulled his gun

out, and went up and broke the window and said "If

that bell again,

I'll blow your head off".

M: Well, he's not tough; he's crazy.

S: He's been tough. I mean. He know what he's done.

M: He's probably out of his mind. He belongs in a cell. That's right.

S: That's right.

M: The toughest guys I knot, you never get a word out of then for four hours.

Those are the tough guys that I knon.

The guy that you just described as a

tough guy, he's no tough guy.

G: Now here'n what's -

M: They should be driven out of town or kept in the can, and you can tell them

that you'll see to it that he is.

G:

Here's what STEVE don't want and here's what's happened. The reason this guy

is running around like he is.

He does that promiscuously, yousee. Like PAUL

was fixing to tell you about him shooting up a house with a machine-gun down

Well, he didn't do 1t, but had it done.

He'll come up and say, "Yeah,

I did it, MR. BUTLER.

I''n not a bit sorry. You would have done it yourself

if he had done you that way."

Well, he can go right down there and get those

indictnents quashed. They don't want to have to put up with that kind of

deal. In other words, you and the District Attorney have been elected on a

of embarrassment to the Police

there and you say "bingo" -

S:

They never put one in the penitentiary.

P: You remember we had a new District Attorney elected. All right,

so you bring

in a murder indictnent against GREEN, or you bring in any kind of a warrant

on Green that you want on him, and he's not going to get quashed in that

grand jury, not under WILL.

K: Something wrong with the Police Department.

S: Yes, where are they?

M: This is all so petty, so small.

P: The lay, they don't go at night. The only man you got to worry about, STEVE,

is the fellow who goes to church every Sunday and vou don't know mho he kill-

ed. That's the guy you got to worry about, and you don't know that he killed

anybody.

S: You know yourself how many have been killed this year. I don't want any of

that stuff on me.

P: Ordinarily when two people like that tangle, like LOIS GREEN kills POOLE or

POOLE kills LOIS GREEN, they don't even mention it in the paper. Why should

they mention it? Here's a cöuple of dope fiends.

One killed the other.

M:

Well, they encourage it in Chicago, because that's the only way you can do it.

them take care of themselves.

P: But that has nothing to do with it: Those things are petty.

M:

Now, when you get in office, you know all of the prominent and most popular

petty thieves.

S: I know them all.

M:

You can call them in immediately and lay the law down to them. You know how

to talk to them.

It's

your business.

S: I sure do. I know how to talk to them.

M: That's all.

G: Hell, let's let him alone. STEVE can tend to them.

M: Oh, I know. That's his business.

G:

Really the only thing you men are interested in is a legitimate go?

M: That's right. It's just

a matter of our business is all it 1s.

Well, you've branched out, I understand, a little bit.

M:

What do you mean?

G:

Well, some of these other towns, like New Orleans, maybe. The same type of

organization in other words that he's proposing to us.

M: "ell, they all get along.

G: Yes, that'w what I mean. If it works, it should work.

M: One hand watches the other, and it keeps business in the family. That way

things are done, whether it's in

"ew York, Chicago, or New Urleans.

G: "ell, you see, there may be some difference in the temperament of the people

in Chicago and down here.

M: No.

S:

Something else, here as it is, and I don't like the set-up, the District

Attorney is tied up with the Sheriff and the council, etc., and you cant'

indict anybody in Dallas County for anything.

G: If they've got the money.

S: In other words, there's a fix for any indictment in Dallas, Texas. All you

got to do is have the money.

I don't want to tie myself down as to

themselves clean and don't get into any trouble, everything's all right.

But if they get into trouble, I'll indict them as quick as I will anybody, and

I want them to know that. But, in other words, I want that clear.

M: I told you STEVE that I wouldn't tolerate it myself.

M:

I know we don't in Chicago. We don't have that kind of people around.

P: There's one thing we won't tolerate at all, and that's thieves, murierers, dope

peddlers.

Those things are out.

He don't have nobody around us, nor will

let anybody be around us that are connected with it in any way, shape, or form.

S: I understand. Oh, I understand that.

our slot machines going, because we absolutely have no love

M: I just met MR. JONES not so long ago.

G: Well, you've kinda sold us, Paul has, on his know here. In other words, his

knowledge of the town and

set-up.

S: He does. He knows everything that's going on.

M: That's what I had heerd.

s: Yeah, he knows.

M: Particularly the last couple of days.

G: He's a pretty good fellow.

Ke know ourselves that, being a law enforcement officer ana a good one, i feel

like I am, I know I am.

He know that the money is going to be going somewhere.

We know there's going

to be dice games, and so I don't feel badly about talking

about it, because I like to play cards, maybe shoot a little dice myself, and,

you know,

at the right time and right place. But we have got - Another thing

you might be able to helo PAuL on.

Naturally, I'm interested in a good offer.

I want to know approximately what it would be worth to me to out this thing

over, because I malked

my feet off and I worked like a dog, ano it's worth an

awful lot to me to take a chance, for it's taking a chance in a sort of way.

M: Hell, you can't say. But I'm sure it'll be worth your thile.

G:

As you can see from STEVE'S house, he needs a little furniture and how much

it's going to take to get it.

All the ready cash he had went into his cam-

paign.

s:

You can get all of the furniture you want, but you can't get that long green.

I spent

everything I had.

I know that it has been more or less of an embarrassment to him to have to

around here.

I, 'he stays around us, he'll be doing well in ten or fifteen years, I'll say.

Everybody's happy. Everybody's got beautiful homes, living comfortably, go

away a month or two at a time.

That's all i could tell you. Like i say, I

won't lie to you or tell you what you can look for or expect; - Because I

woaldn't want to lie to you. I don't like to do business that way.

s:

Nor, look. bet me tell you this.

I want to get this straight with you, PAll.

In other words, the only thing

that you are going to expect from me is pro-

tection, that's all?

P: That's all.

S: But wait, you can go a little further. The only thing you expect from me is

protection on gambling, nothing else. That's all?

P: That's all.

S: jothing else. I want to get that streight.

M: Something I'm against, that's dope pedalers, pickpockets, hired killers.

That's one thing I cant stomach and that's the one thing the fellows up there

won't stand for, things like that. They even go to headquarters and ask them

why they don't do something about it. It they don't, they say a change will

be made and it will be done.

Oh, we're against things like that. It really

don't help the office. It doesn't help you out on the street.

S: Well, I know.

I told STEVE, I said, we may be so slow that he may wonder when are they going

to get all of these things started?

When is PAUL going to do all of these

things, that he said he was going to do?

We are only going to do them as fast

as we can and not jeopardize you and ourselves, and if we can make a million

dollers a month in a business-like manner, we are going to make it.

If we can

only make a hundred dollars a month, if that's the way it is, then it's a

hundred, and that's all it is.

But your're not going to be jeopardized nor

are we going to jeopardize ourselves because we're not money hungry. Now, if

1 come in here like I told you and suppose i get you a flat proposition that

strength isn't here. Suppose I!m having a lot of trouble getting these things

because you've got to do this in a business-like menner.

I've got $50,000

I've got to get.

Nor, I'm going to get it if I have to sacrifice you to get

it. I've elready given you $50, 000.

S: You're right.

P: And when you lay down at night, that pillow is going to feel like it's got bricks

in it because you're not going

to be able to sleep.

You've got that pressure

on you. Because I'm going to be at that front door.

Sure, Once you get organized, you don't have to worry about money. iverything

roll in a nice quiet manner, in a business-like way.

You don't, he don't

nave to worry about it personally. Everybody will be happy, I'm sure.

Do you think that there's any way that they can find out that there's a tie-up

between here and up there in Chicago?

P: No.

M: So far as we're concerned, we don't want it. Naturally: we don't want it, I'm

sure.

K: There'll be nobody know.

Mi: We're not going to come from Chicaga down here.

s: In other words, they'll all be local boys?

M: All local fellows.

He're leaving that to him. He's representing us.

S: All right, now. I've talked to PlUL.

Well, look. PAUL thinks or says that he can take care of them. I've got to

be sure of

that because if they think that I'm crooked.

They think if I'm

taking any money they can go to the Attorney üeneral and have me impeached.

P:

STEVE,

as I told you before, i don't even want you to admit to yourself, let

alone anybody else. I don'

M: He tola me that. Put without all of these promises and assurances that he would

take care of these boys, I wouldn't even think about comine here.

thig is as, and it should be, that you wouldn't worry about a thing. Now, whan

What do you think about the possibilities? PAUL says he can get him.

what do you think about the possibilities of getting to a man like that?

Do you think it can be done?

M: Oh, certainly. Yes.

G: he'll have to play ball with someone.

#: Do you know him?

P: Thy,

sure. He knows him. People you know, you dan't come out in the cold.

K: As a matter of fact, FAT only supports me.

S: I know that, but I was just asking.

M: All of these people have to be talked to. It don't matter who they are, they

have to be approached by certain people.

There are certain ways of doing it.

S:

We'll see, I've never been in politics before.

STEVE, listen, if I didn't' have - let me tell you something.. If I didn't have

the Sheriff be? He wouldn't be here, because what good are you if you haven't

iverybody's happy. If the District

Attorney indicts you, you never even contact certain people. You never even

if you see them out on the street, you wouldn't even know them.

I wouldn't make an attempt even to come down here if I didn't think for a min-

G:

well, you know PAUl has been here for sometime.. He's been active and

quietly getting around.. But l've made some checks about PAUL here a while back

worry about, I'll guarantee you they've got sleepless nights already just wor-

that STEVE don't like this local crowd and is gonna run them out.

G: Low much money is spent for dice in your corporation?

M:

I don't know what the set-up is. I haven't talked to Paul. I don't know what

he had in mind.

We up there, we don't believe in it.. One thing ' 'I against,

always was against. I don't Ilke, like 1 was telling you last night, five or

six joints in the radius of six blocks, a joint every block.. That's one thing

• have always talked against.: I like one: big spot and that's all.. Out in th

ountry, out of the city entirely. In the city maybe you have a dice game 1

one block and two blocks maybe you have another dice game in one block and two

blocks maybe you have another dice game, horse betting, what you call the book

parlors, or whatever you call them.

S:

The way it has looked here,

the Sheriff who is the present Sheriff, SMOOT SCHMID,

made an agreenent with the city and with the City Council: and the menager 1f

he rould stey out of the city, they would stay out of the county. So the

Sherifi never comes in the city and the city never goes in the county. But

he is paid, the sherlff is paid out of the city, that he will have no dice

games in the county.

Now, how about that?

well, that's under the present set-up.

leah, now, what do you think? Do you think somebody's gonna start hollering

when we think we'll put some places in the county?

P: Vie're only gonna put one place in.

S: Fell, I know.

M: All we need is one spot.. That's allo: I'm in favor of one big spot and that's

all.

people go out there. It's the biggest game.

ia: 1n the county?

P: No, out of the county. It's 20 feet out of the county, but all dallas goes

there because there's no place.

There's no such thing as a big joint place in town at ell. There was one place

and all surrounding suburbs wind up right in this Lee County. There's just

one place and there they all wind up every night.: The lty's closed, 'it's

quiet, and there's nothing going there.

S:

They're all in the city.: All the hotels have got dice games in them. Maybe

there's about six or eight hotels running every day.

M: You got no jurisdiction in the city, do you?

S:. Oh, yeah; I'm over the entire county. I'm over the city and the county.

Go you put the heat on those.

S: All I've got to do is tell them to run off, if 1 want to, in the city or the

county. But the way the thing has been run, there's no dice games in the

county, they're all in the city. But your idea is to get in the county to

get the city.

P: You take the Chicken Bar out here. If that was the only big dice game.

S: Where?

P: The Uhicken Bar.

s: Oh, man, that

would be a set-up.

P: Take that Chicken Bar there and put you a dice game in there.

S: Oh, man!

afford to lose, unless they can afford to gamble.

now the Dallas boys have the biggest percentage of the take of that game.

reason for that, FRED has gone broke and many times out there.

FRED, every night after they close, he brings all of the money in and bets 1t

S° Oh, I see.

P: He's probably the biggest individual horse better in the country. It!s one of

the first games I ever heard of that they'll take his check.. There's been times

out there when he couldn't pay off in cash, but they take his check because he

was capable of raising it in the next morning and he's paid off a lot of times

out there with a check.

S: But it's a big, big game.

P: And he had to take this man in for money.

S: DALTON? well, I wanted to try. to explain that you so you would know that the

county has never had any dice games.

They've had some sneak games.

They go in there and bet on the baseball. They have a ticker and the basket

out of their pockets, picked them all up, picked about eight of them up.: Charged

then with - What did I charge them with? 'Ganing? Oh, I don't remember what

the charge was.. I think it was gaming and vag. I vagged them; and they kept

outting it off and putting it off, and you know how hard 'it is to remember nig-

jers, the next time they came in I didn't remember a one of them. But come to

find out, not only dion't I remember then, but they had changed niggers: and

social security cards. But it's a big thing. This policy. Very big.

G: Don't they have big front boys in Chicago?

M: There're never any front boys. Never were.

(There followed further general discussion of the policy game in Chicago sim-

1lar to above.)

That's one thing, since I have been with the Department, there's never been

anything done about policy.

There's never been a policy wheel raided and they

have the drawings right out in the open.

Pat.

Contacted Paul Jones.

He is leaving Dallas at 12.55 tonight for Chicago.

He said his life

had been threatened several times lately. There is some friction be-

tween the Lipky and the wineberg factions. The Fed. Gov't has put a stop

to his activities in Mexico, temporarily, at least until Aleman gets in.

The syndicate he is connected with operates from coast to coast and in

Canaada and Spain.

He is göing. to be sent to Spain in the near iuture.

From Chicago he will go to N.Y. get his wife and return to Dallas in ab

out a week or 10 days.

His outfit always keeps up with his local doings.

He only goes places where his outfit will know who he goes with. He could

go into any fairly large city in the U.S. and his syndicate would have

some connection there.

In case he ran into any local trouble he would call

his office long distance and they would send him the money he needed, or

all the men he needed, or he could get help from Naxey Gordon whose phone

number he had in his pocket.

While he was in Mex. City someone broke into his apt. and stole his

snub-nose 38 pistol & he wanted to know if he would find out if it was an

officer or a thief who took it.

That Labriola was a stepson of Mangane, a big time Chicago criminal.

Labriola was ne of the men at large wno was called in to settle differ-

ences for the syndicate.

That Lipsky was one of the greatest connen in the country.

That his outfit was buying lots of sugar for $20 and $21 dollars a

100# and re-selling it for $27.00 per 100#•

That generally when they went into a town they operate through a fix,

who was powerful enough to run things.

In return his outfit did every-

thing they could to keep the heat off the town.

That Wichita Falls would

be an unusual opportunity for them to make lots of money.

That in Dallas he was authorized to offer the new D.A. & Sheriff

1000.00 per week each plus 123% each for complete protection.

That the Jones boys, colored policy operators in

#200,000. for the snatch there end thet toes ate not coil cOmeSiON

sion

That his outfit was making every effort to take over the wire service

whose headquarters are in Chicago and whose take is approximately $1,000,000.00

per week over the country.

That should his syndicate get a fix in the county and in the new City

Government, that they are sure will move

in in May, his outfit will see to

it personally that much local crime is eliminated by persuasion.

Most of the

black market handled by his outfit got to Spain via Vera Cruz Mexico and are

packed for shipment in Mahogany crates.

That the Dallas people who operate for his syndicate are well known.

one of the operations are ever operated anywhere by people brought in from

the outside, but by local people who front for them.

"is outfit has a large number of slot machines they can and will move

into this areawhen they get the go ahead signal.

Wineberg put a lot of heat on Lipsky by his crude methods.

Wineberg

and Lipsky are on the outs.

Paul jones seemed to go out of his way to emphasize the idea his people

did not want to stir up any trouble among local gamblers, but he had been

approached by some of them to bring in a non-limit crap game for the Fair.

10-29-46 - 10.30 P.M.

Paul Jones called my house

and after

some casual conversation asked if

i had seen Steve G. lately.

I told him I had played golf with Steve the day

before and would play golf with him again tomorrow.

That i had been on my

vacation for the past 2 days and had not been around the house much. He

said he would consider it a favor if I could make some arrangements for him

to talk to Steve.

Paul will call again tomorrow night at 6.15 P.M. Cali-

ed the office to report conversation but It. Daniel & Capt. Fritz were both

gone.

10-30

Re: Paul Jones

After the golf game today I asked Steve if he had ever heard of faul

Jones. He laughed and said "Are you kidding?"

"Wonder why someone hasn't

all ready killed him?" Then i explained the police dept. was very much

interested in Paul's local connections and activities and that Paul want-

ed to talk to him and we would appreciate it if he would help us out as it

may add to our information about Paul's methods of operating. Steve

agreed to do this and mentioned Col. Garrison at Austin - who Steve had met

while attending school.

That he would like for his own protection to make

recordings of what was said for future reference.

Steve said to tell Paul

to come over tomorrow night at 8 P.W. if he called.

Jack Darhy and Bill Holcomb had a drunken brawl. Two of Jack's friends

He pulled out a roll of $100.00 bills and told me that he wanted me

to have a good time on him - that 1 wasn't always putting him in jail.

re also wanted me to contact some of the big boys for him and see if 1

He said his syndicate would be willing to put in slot

machines for any one who could make a fix.

After all expenses were paid out

ated by his syndicate under the name of Mid-lest Wire Service. By having

control of this service they would have a good lever with with to pry fur-

ther into other profitable sources of income. That they were going to ex-

pand their liquor interests in Dallas.

That Steve could really do himself

a lot of good when he goes in by operating through their set up. That af-

ter Steve had held office one term and wanted to run again his outfit would

buy off all competition and pay all his campaign expenses out of their end

of the profit.

Also that come election time, Steve would get letters from

his good (?) friends Bob Hannegan and President Truman, congratulating him

on his wonderful record and expressing the hope the good people of Dallas

would. see fit to re-elect him.

Under the new systen which his syndicate operates, the Sheriff or the

I. A. (whichever one they make their ded with) enters into a 50-50 partner-

ship with each other.

Steve could pick out any friend of his that he liked

and trusted.

The Chicago outfit would set this friend up in the coin mach-

ine business, furnishing him with all the capital and equipment necessary.

'his friend would operate the business on a purely business basis, keeping

track of every cent coming in and going out.

The syndicate would furnish

this lucky operator with a machine mechanic and a good well coached accoun-

tant to handle the books for Uncle Sam's sake. Utherwise deve's man rould

be on his own. In addition, should any slot machine thief, or rival op-

erator, steal a machine or cause any trouble to the new operation, they

would be broke of the habit (in due and ancient form).

On the big crap game they would like to open, the same kind of deal

would be made.

Their syndicate would furnish expert operators working

under the supervision of local people. After all expenditures and pay

offs to other grafters, his outfit and Steve vill divide the net profits.

Also, Steve would get 50-50 on wire service, footbell and baseball service,

political races and all like income.

This super-dooper crap game will play for the big boys. It will be a

non-limit game and will be fair and square. Of course, he says his outfit

When

handle a big set up like this he suggested - front men for the rackets Chick

Todd Lee

Wynne.

The above two multi-millionaires and capable or bringing

big money into

the gambling tables.

These men are well known, not only

locally, but nationally to the sporting and gambling world.

Jones has a great deal of contempt for what he called "chicken feed"

that the local grafters were getting.

This hesitation on the part of local

rackets and vice to fatten up the nut when times were good is the reason

his syndicate is having such an easy time in most cities they are organi-

zing.

He said the pay outs for a city the size of Dallas should be 10 times

what they are.

When I asked Jones how strong his outfit was tied in with

the Federal Government, he said they were fixed and mentioned Truman and

Hannegan.

His people, he said, had no fear of government intervention.

He said StoLouis, Kansas City, New Orleans, Ilttle Rock, to name a

few, were well oiled and everybody was making money. Lipsky was recalled

to Chicago and pulled down off his high horse. His group made a mistake

He said I.K. was doing some ground work for them but would not make

any proposition to anyone until he gave the word.

He also admitted that his syndicate was willing and ready to finen-

cially back any strong local group in the city elections, where a pre-

arranged deal justified the confidence end expense.

He also stressed the strong (to him) point that in cities controlled

by his crowd, major crimes had deceased. The boys had an effective police

force of their own.

Jones is fairly well informed on the local set up. He lound aut what

Paul B. Jones and Jack Knapp arrived today from Uhicago via Kansas

"otel. Paul Jones was contacted by Butler shortly after his arrival at the

Rex Liquor Store, C1419 Commerce and Akard. This was approximately 11.45

A.M. After eating, getting a hair cut and changing clothes they contacted

Butler at his home, 4251 Cedar springs. They arrived at Butler's house

about 2.45 P.M. at which time Paul Jones introduced his man as Jack Knapp.

Room 831 Adolphus.

Various phases of the local set up were discussed and the following

plans were made.

Jones would probably have his other men here by 3 P.i, tomorrow

(11-6-46) and he would be most happy to be at steve's house by that time.

He would also like to have Steve's chief deputy on hand at the meeting so

they would thoroughly understand each other from the start. Present

would be their big lawyer from Chicago who is supposed to be the best in

the whole country.

At this meeting further plans would be made to set things in action

to move in gradually.

Jones talked about buying the Chicken Pat at It. North cut off and

Industriel Blud. for $185,:000.00 The money to come from his people and

the place to be converted into a gambling club and night spot. ne said

other locations were discussed but this was the perfect location.

In regard to the new club at Lobello's, Jones had the following to

say.

It was not operated by his people. It was a

"key" club with a very

select, limited membership of 300 keys.

It was being changed over to a

very high class "joint".

sowever, there was nothing to worry about. His

people would cut off his wiskey, beer, gaming equipment, have the place

raided and before you knew it, Mr. Lobello would have to close. His se-

Jection of some of the most prominent people was primarily for political

protection.

Jack Knapp did not have much to say. He dia comment that things would

be so gradually opened

and all by local people that no one could trace or

put any heat on the D.A. or Sheriff's office. That no violence would re-

sult from their nethod

of operation, no one would be killed, sna every

one would make lots of money.

Anapp said his home was in Fort Smith, Ark. and that he had operated

a lot in Little Rock.

He saia he and l'aul registered as being from Buffalo,

(Harry Hornstein).

se said his people had some of the largest beer distribution in Dallas

and the same applied to whiskey. They could use these things to get things

done without any actual force.

Jones said he knew the local syndicate was very muchly interested in

him and his activities and that was one reason he registered as being from

Buffalo. Apparently this was his idea.

He hinted that the local people

would be surprised to know just how much their supposedly hiaden activities

were known.

Both men thought it was

a swell idea to meet at Steve's house. It would

do no one any good for any of them to be seen together.

In the morning,

they are going to rent a car to use. This is better and less noticeable

a texi, so they said.

Jones indicated that 3 more men were due in Dallas tonight or tom-

it the same time he said it was important that all be present.

In regard to the guns Jones said that they sent out a man in Chicago

to get one.

He had never heard anything about this type of pistol before.

When he came back, empty handed, he told all the boys he was going to get

one of the dann things for himself. After the explanation was made, by

their "messenger" Jones said he wanted one personally, too.

Just before they left Chicago they heard where one could be obtained.

Is it is still there it will be brought in by his man in the morning.

Jones gave me at

Rangers recorded conversation which took place

in Steve's study at home

Present at these negotiations were Steve Guthrie, Pat Manning, Paul

Jones, Jack Knapp and George Butler.

Various problems in connection with fixing the various people in-

volved were discussed. It was indicated that already in the bag were:

Al fempleton, Gonzales, hill filson and that the city would be an easy

change over, come the April elections.

Manning commented that he had been doing business for thepast 15

years and, as yet, had not run into any serious trouble.

That he was here

to bankroll the local operation..

That he had a section of Chicago and

everyone there was making money and happy.

That other operations over the

country were run in the same set up and no one was any wiser.

That he was

very muchly interested in the numbers or policy wheels, and the crap games.

He wanted it understood, though, that the deal covered all forms of busi-

ness and named slot machines, horse joints, policy, punch boards, crap

games, wire service, football selections and other forms of legitimate take.

He was not interested in dope, whores, thieves, or any grand jury or D.A.

fix or any form of crime other than gambling.

His people would cooperate

with the Sheriff in every way to discourage the more violent and serious

crimes.

That they were going to send down a man right away to make a sur-

vey of

every local set up, and this would be in such a way that no one would

become wise.

Manning caught the 4.45 F.M. Braniff Plane out of Dallas, bound for

Chicago. Jack Knapp is still in town.

Both inapp and Paul Jones are going to Chicago in the next few

days.

Paul Jones called tonight about 6.30 P.ii, with above info.

Jones said that everything went off U.K. but he wants to get together

• with me and let our hair down.

That he wanted us to confide in each other.

He wanted me to meet the big boys, both locally and the ones who would

come in, on a social basis. Jones asked if I thought Steve had given the

go ahead in good faith.

Today, at the meeting at Guthries, Manning accidentally pulled out of

his pocket

a roll of large bills, $1, 000.00. The roll was bent in the mid-

dle and folded over. It was about as thick as a package of cigarettes.

When he sawn me looking at it he hurriedly stuck it back in his pocket.

"ater, when we got into my car, I saw Manning hand Paul Jones some-

thing i was sure was the roll of bills. Jones ment bäck into the house and

came out shortly with Steve.

After a short conversation on the porch,

Jones got in the car and we left.

I called Steve later and asked him if Jones hadn't offered him some

money. He said "Yes, it was a roll of large bills, which he estimated as

being around $15,000.00..

My own estimate would be approximately $25 -

$50,000.00 if all were $1,000.00 notes.

Steve said he rejected the money

and to tell Jones when I saw him that he thought it was a poor may to give

a man a "hand-out".

Juôge Al Templeton and his wife Allie, were the guests of Paul Jones in

their recent trip to Mexico City, according to Paul.

Shortly aiter Manning, Knapp and Paul Jones left the Snowden Dist. lo.

they returned to the hotel, had dinner and then Manning, called on Earl Dalton

at the Southland. He told Dalton he understood Dalton was formerlv connect-

ed with some people in Chicago. That he, Manning was in the beer racket

and wanted to move to Dallas.

That the elections in thicago put a lot of

heat on his business and they were going to have to lay low for a while.

Manning was very curious about the local racket set up, local politics, how

much power the Texas Rangers has, if the Rangers could go over a Sheriff's

head, how the city was fixed, how the city and county got along together,

in short, he tried to find out as much as he could about the local syndi-

cates method of operation. He told Dalton he was leaving on the 4.45 F.M.

plane for Chicago.

distance phone about the deal still being 0.K.

I told him if there was any

doubt he would talk to them personally. He suggested Steve fly to Chicago

but I told him that would be out of the question.

Jones said the man sitting at the table with him Sat. night at the Cen-

Andrews, Chilton,

to a beton tale on testate time

Manning was in Dallas and offered him the town saying; the local group was

"out".

Jones said he understood the local syndicate

was out after the first

Jones said also that Samaris claimed he had everything after

Jones also seid that Niem Nate and abomt 20 of his boys were

here from Pittsburgh and Niger and 4 of his boys were staying at the Baker.

All could be picked up at San's Place.

Jones used the phone several times. He called the Adolphus Hotel and

asked to be connected to 1036.

The line was busy and he got the operator

to cut him in on the conversation.

Later he called back and talked to Jack

Anapp.

Whatever the conversation

Jones immediately called the Bruniff

Airlines and cancelled his reservations to tonights flight, making reser-

vations on the 4•45 P.M. flight 11-20-46, for Mr. and Mrs. Donald Baske

814 W. 26th Place, Chicago, Illinois, Jack Knapp and himself.

Gutler informed Jones that there was a pick up on all

at this time and it would be advisable for Jones

to leave or lie low for a while. Inasmuch as Jones had some dental work he had

to have done and also had his wife here he seid he would have to take a chance

by staying.

he asked Butler to take himto the washington Apts. where B. met

Paul when Roby was coming in, and Paul said, tomorrow evening.

Jones. had already told Eutler that J: ack Knapp would be in tomorrow so Roby

and Jack are probably one and the same.

In discussing Ramon and Madden Jones

advised me to go ahead and arrest then - run them out of town, that they and

San Yaris were nothing but trouble makers..

That he, Jones, could not arzord to

ask eny questions about them but they all hung around Sam Yaris' place and coula

be picked up there.

On being questioned about Bundy and Strance, Jones stated that they had;

This declaration by these men was made at about the same time Paul

Jones made his. Paul was with Vogel and Manning at the time he last called

wait until steve gets set before they start moving.

N.Y. City dated 11-16-46 and addressed to Paul Jones c/o Jacobson Co. 324 Halsted

The letter was for an

order of specified steel sheeting 325,625 pounds for which Jones had been given a

check for $325.00 by Mr. Mann, who told Jones that the rest of the money would be

paid by a sight draft on delivery. The letter mentioned the writer having met

wirs. Jones, a very charming person, and hoped that she was feeling fine. Apparently

the deal was made at the Syracuse Hotel and was of the black market variety.

ordered a large bunch of them when pens were hard to get.

Jones had an appointment with his lawyer T. K. at 3 P.M. I drove him from

the apartment to the Irwin - Kessler Bldg. in my car.

Jones seemed to be very sincere about Samaria being his enemy and wanting

to cause him all the trouble possible. He said Sam had already got a call from

Chicago to keep his big mouth shut.

He said, in all probability Ramon and Madden

outside racketeers in Dallas.

Paul seid Jack Knapp was going to come in from Chicago on the 7.55 p.n. plane

and asked me if I would take him and Mrs. Jones out to meet the plane.

agreed to do and we met the plane, zoing directly from the airport to Paul's house.

Paul sent Mrs. Jones in the house and I explained again to Jack what was about to

happen, cretending that San Yaris was the man who put all the heat on the outsid-

Jack asked me what they should ao.

I said leave before everyone gets locked

He said to Paul that he thought it was a good idea and that he had plenty of

things in the next two weeks for him and Paul to be busy doing.

On being questioned about the bundy - strance deal Jack said that was a lot

of pop corn and had finally been straightened out.

Knapp said he and Paul had several things to discuss but that they would leave

tonight via plane.

Knapp asked me if I had any confidence in Steve Guthrie.

I

said - "Yes, why?"

He said - "Well, if you have, alright; because we have plenty

of confidence in you.

Apparently they had been hearing lots about Sam Yaris, big mouth in Chicago,

because Knapp said he has not the least surprised that it was laris who brought on

the heat.

Paul said he thought fritz was under the impression that he and Sem Yaris

worked together.

Knapp asked me if I would mina takire them to the airport and I seid I wouldn't

mind.

he told Paul to tell his wile to pack and they got out of the car about

8.55 p.M. They

are to call me later to go to the airport.

At 11.00 p.m. Paul Jones called and asked me to meet him at his apartment.

On arrival there,

he said he and Jack had talked it over and decided that it would

be best for Steve, Butler, and

everyone else concerned if he, Paul, were errested

with the other boys.

I told him that my info. was that Satcher

ano Lou Schneider had made an agreement to collect from Lipsky the money he owed

Satcher. (or else). Paul said the "or else" may depend on whether Danny Lardine was

with Lipsky. Paul Jones said Lipsky had bought out Buddy satcher's Interest st

$45,000.00, also 5% in several routes running out of La.

After about 30 min. Paul pulled out a very large roll of 91, 000.00 bills and said

if hs friend the sheriff wanted anything to let him know.

Then he reached into his

pocket and pulled out another wad of bills.

From ths roll he gave every one present

the others acted disgusted with him and wanted to call a cab.

I carried them to the

vent of a raid, how to take care of grand jury evidence, and some other angles that

his people were interested in.

Paul discussed a very recent indictment against him which ne claims vas an effort

to get him in the pen. The whole thing was a frame up by the local syndicate and was

put through by Bill Decker at the insistence of Binions group.

He said Dean Gauldin at first knew nothing about his indictment but that men he

found out about it Gauldin got mad

and that Jack's father was Fellt Witti or Nappie

Both Knapp's and

Jack Happy or

parents were born in Italy.

Jones claimed he could get Al Capone to come to Dallas if Steve wanted them, but

it was very bad business for Steve to bring people like that into Dallas as it caused

lots of heat.

Jones very pointedly gave me a hint that I should leave the room. He apparently

gave

Steve quite a roll, amount to be verified later.

Jones said Knapp and some of the other boys were coming in next week and we would

all get together for one last meeting. He also said that things were bound to come up

to change everyone's plans (if he only knew).

Talked to Steve and he said he was ready-not only to tear up the Chicago outfit

but the Soutnland and Herb Noble as well.

He feels like he has been double crossed

on all sides by people he thought he could trust. Has had to refinance his cars and

make arrangements to take care of some other incidentals. He told me to make the

final arrangements to close out the case with the Chicago people. After leaving

Steve 1 contacted Paul Jones. He and his wife were home getting ready for bed.

his conversation Jones said he dian't quite understand Steve. He, Paul, was ready

to go any time Steve gave the word Jones went over his last conversation with Steve.

te offered Steve enough money to take care of his immediate needs and the needs of

his deputies.

Also, he said he wanted to see that I got enough cash to handle any-

thing I needed at this time.

Jones says he can't see any occasion tor bringing any more people here. He says

Steve should be careful

about talking to lots of people, about a fix. That when 2

or more talked it over it was a conspiracy and the Federal could handle the set uo.

I assured him that Steve only wanted a definite understanding not only with Jones but

the man back of him.

Jones went to a dresser drawer and took out a large roll of bills. He said he

had all the money he could ever use, that he had money in every drawer in the house,

and when Steve gave the word he could get all he needed.

se told Steve about now he could make some extra money after he got into office

by sending some of his men out to meet his trucks when they got to the county line.

By excorting the trucks through the county to keep them from being hi-jacked he could

pick up some honest money.

Jones also said he was planning à trip to Havana to take over a club there for

the winter season.
