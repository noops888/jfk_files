SA MILIER is a mature agent, has a large,

sturdy build, dresses neatly, is well groomed and

presents an excellent personal appearance.

He has a

friendly, businesslike personality.

SA MILLER continues to be assigned to Head-

quarters City with primary responsibility for the investigation

of security-type cases involving the Communist Party,

espionage, satellite nations and related matters.

He is very dependable, his written work is

prepared in a careful and thorough manner and requires

little or no supervision, and he has an excellent knowledge

of the Bureau's rules and regulations. He has no

by them.

On January 5, 1961, SA MILLER, along with several

other agents of the Atlanta Office, was commended by the

Director for the excellent work done in the investigation

and subsequent apprehension of Lawrence Robert Duncan,

an Identification Order fugitive and a Conditional Release

Violator.
