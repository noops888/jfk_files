ASSAULTING A FEDERAL OFFICER

Re Washington Field airtel 11/7/67 captioned

"Carlos Marcello, aka., Anti-Racketeering."

Washington Field should not request former

WT 1633-C-TE to obtain the photo described in referenced

airtel from Jack Wasserman, subject's attorney.

i.:"

New Orleans review appropriate news articles in an

effort to obtain copies of appropriate news photos taken

: at

the time of subject's arrival at New Orleans Airport and his

attempted assault of an FBI Agent. Make no oper inquiries in

this regard.

It is noted that a superseding indictment was obtained

from a new grand jury on 6/1/67 because of possible questions

concerning the impanelling of the grand jury originally

indicting subject on this charge.

RO 578441333-21

Re: Carlos Marcello

NOTE: Former WF 1633-C-TE was in recent personal contact with

Carlos Marcello, a leading hoodlum and racketeer in Louisiana.

Marcello related he had obtained a news photo showing him

carrying his

raincoat on the arm he allegedly used in an

attempted assault on a Bureau Agent.

Wr 1633-C-TE later viewed

this photo in possession of Marcello's attorney who also stated

he had found an error in the impanelling of the Federal Grand

Jury which indicted Marcello.

New Orleans isbing instructed

to discreetly attempt to locate copies of news photos taken of

Marcello at the time of the attempted assault.

oh cared him 2o 1s8 vant chare the ang nat

It is noted that

Marcello was re-indicted on this charge by a new grand jury on

6/1/67 because of the possibility that the original grand jury

clear which grand jury WF 1633-C-TE refers to.
